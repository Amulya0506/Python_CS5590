Blind date: ‘I wish it had been on a Friday: I’d have liked more cocktails’
Christmas music is inescapable this time of year, making it impossible to hold a neutral opinion about the genre. But what causes people to fall into one camp or the other?
Here, two writers flesh out the very personal reasons that the same annual din makes one desolate and the other merry.
I hate Christmas music in public. In New York, I can’t go to the deli to get a soda, drink a cup of coffee in a diner, buy a pack of condoms in a drugstore, hear a radio station in the dentist’s office or even walk down the street without being bombarded with a stream of insipid bromides and jingles about how happy I should be.
My reasons for hating unsolicited Christmas music are pretty personal. The holiday has stopped being enjoyable since my dad, mom and stepmother all died in my twenties; indeed, the whole season has become unbearable since one of my sisters died halfway through my thirties. Already blue in my thoughts from Thanksgiving to New Year’s, Christmas music invades my melancholy and makes it worse, forcing me to think about happy Christmases past never to be repeated, and to feel like a failure as a single adult without children.
I know I’m not alone in these thoughts, though. Who among us wants to hear reminders of the good time you’re supposed to be having at home, at work, in the store and on the radio, every incessant second?
As a Christian, I usually celebrate the holiday in some form. I’ve sung in many gospel choir concerts and know most of the Christmas standards by heart. I’ve hosted many a party where I’ve donned a Santa hat and played Christmas songs all night long. But I can turn this music on or off. When I am walking down the street or want to buy a toothbrush, I don’t want to be forced repeatedly to pine for a reality, a family or a set of experiences which are not available to me — and which should not be foisted on anyone.
What I resent most about Christmas music is that it’s used as a blatant tool of social control to make us long for families that may be broken or deceased, and to desire consumer goods we don’t want and can’t afford. It’s also theocratic, and its omnipresence in the commons disrespects people who aren’t Christians. It even robs Christians of the chance to appreciate Christmas music as something special, and of the chance to just be with the quiet of the season.
The trick to liking Christmas music is finding the right Christmas music to like.
Obvious, yes, but not so easy to do, given the amount of garbage there is to sift through. Starting around Halloween, that’s all that plays in continuous rotation at the mall, Starbucks, Bill O’Reilly’s dressing room, even the quick-change oil place down the street, for some reason. It’s inescapable. It’s no wonder people hate Christmas music.
But just as the spirit of Christmas exists apart from the annual orgy of consumerism that overtakes us like a bloodlust, the spirit of Christmas music isn’t to be found in yet another version of Winter Wonderland or the kind-of-rape-y Baby, It’s Cold Outside.
There’s plenty to love about Christmas music that doesn’t involve hoary standards worn thinner than Grandpa’s holiday tie, though even standards done well have a certain charm: Emmylou Harris singing The First Noel is spellbinding no matter how many times I hear it, and Paul Westerberg’s ramshackle version of Away in a Manger is perfect in its half-assed glory.
Apart from those, the Christmas songs I love fall into two categories. First, subversive novelty tunes that spoof the ridiculous parts of the holiday season: Monty Python’s Christmas in Heaven, or Nick Lowe’s Christmas at the Airport, or Big Freedia’s over-the-top new Christmas jam Make It Jingle, a paean to ostentatious gifts and lewd dance moves. Come to think of it, that one’s probably not satirical, but it’s fun in a way that Santa Baby hasn’t been since 1953.
Then there are the poignant, heart-on-sleeve songs, because who doesn’t like to wallow a bit every now and then? The Pogues’ Fairytale of New York, Jesse Malin’s Xmas and John Prine’s Christmas in Prison, to name a few, see past the tinsel and lights to the bittersweet side of the Christmas season. Tidings of joy are often undercut by darker themes: financial instability, hunger, more keenly missing absent loved ones. The sad-bastard songs remind me to be grateful for my own good fortune.
Christmas music also reminds me of my mom, who died two days before Christmas in 2002. She loved the holiday season, and I can’t remember a year when Harris’ Light of the Stable album wasn’t playing while she baked cookies and we decorated the tree. Even in leaner years, she never let on to us kids, or let it dim her enthusiasm. And she would have loved that Nick Lowe song.
Time is a boomerang, not an arrow. I was adopted by Pentecostals and stamped “Missionary”. Christmas was important in the missionary calendar. From the beginning of November, either we were preparing packages to send to the Foreign Field or we were preparing packages to deliver to those in Hot Places returning to the Home Front.
It might have been because my parents had been in the second world war. It might have been because we lived in End Time, waiting for Armageddon. Whatever the reason, there was a drill to Christmas, from making the mincemeat for the mince pies to singing carols to, or rather at, the unsaved of Accrington. Still, Mrs Winterson loved Christmas. It was the one time of the year when she went out into the world looking as though the world was more than a vale of tears.
She was an unhappy woman, and so this happy time in our house was precious. I am sure I love Christmas because she did.
On 21 December every year, my mother went out in her hat and coat while my father and I strung up the paper chains, made by me, from the corners of the parlour cornice to the centre light fitting.
Eventually my mother returned, in what seemed to be a hailstorm, though maybe that was her personal weather. She carried a goose, half-in, half-out of her shopping bag, its slack head hung sideways like a dream nobody can remember. She passed it to me – goose and dream – and I plucked the feathers into a bucket. We kept the feathers to restuff whatever needed restuffing, and we saved the thick goose fat drained from the bird for roasting potatoes through the winter. Apart from Mrs W, who had a thyroid problem, everyone we knew was as thin as a ferret. We needed goose fat.
After I had left home, and later gone to university at Oxford, I went back to the old house, that first Christmas-time. My mother had given me the ultimatum to leave home long since, when I fell in love with a girl, and in a religious house like ours I might as well have married a goat. We hadn’t spoken since. I had lived in a Mini for a bit, lodged with a teacher and eventually left town. During my first term at Oxford I received a postcard – one of those postcards that says post card in blue letters at the top. Underneath, in her immaculate copperplate handwriting was the message: “Are you coming home this Christmas? Love Mother”.
As I reached our little terrace house at the top of the street, I could hear the mostly musical sounds of what is best described as a bossa nova version of “In the Bleak Midwinter”. My mother had thrown out the old upright piano and got herself an electronic organ with double keyboard, orchestra stops, drum and bass.
She hadn’t seen me for two years. Nothing was said. We spent the next hour admiring the effects of snare drum and trumpet solo on “Hark! The Herald Angels Sing”.
My Oxford friend from St Lucia was due to visit me at home, which was brave of her, but when I had tried to explain about my family she thought I was exaggerating. At first the visit was a great success. Mrs W considered a black friend as a missionary endeavour all of its own. She went round to the retired missionaries from the church and asked: “What do they eat?” Pineapples, came the answer.
When Vicky arrived my mother gave her a wool blanket she had knitted so that Vicky would not be cold. “They feel the cold,” she told me.
Mrs Winterson was an obsessive and she had been knitting for Jesus all year. The Christmas tree had knitted decorations on it, and the dog was imprisoned inside a Christmas coat of red wool with white snowflakes. There was a knitted nativity scene, and the shepherds were wearing little scarves because this was Bethlehem on the bus route to Accrington.
My dad opened the door dressed in a knitted waistcoat and matching knitted tie. The whole house had been re-knitted.
Mrs W was in a merry mood. “Would you like some gammon and pineapple, Vicky? Cheese on toast with pineapple? Pineapples and cream? Pineapple upside-down cake? Pineapple fritters?” Eventually, after a few days of this fare, Vicky said: “I don’t like pineapple.”
Mrs W’s mood changed at once. She didn’t speak to us for the rest of the day and she crushed up a papier-mache robin. The next morning, at breakfast, the table was set with a pyramid of unopened tins of pineapple chunks and a Victorian postcard of two cats on their hind legs dressed up like Mr and Mrs. The caption said “Nobody loves us”.
That night, when Vicky went to bed, she found that her pillow had been removed and the pillowcase stuffed with warning leaflets about the Apocalypse. She wondered whether to go home, but I’d seen worse and I thought things might improve.
On Christmas Eve we had a group of carol singers round from the church. Mrs W did seem happier. She had forced me and Vicky to wrap several half-cabbages in tinfoil and spear them with cocktail sticks of cheddar cheese, topped with the rejected pineapple chunks.
She called these things sputniks. It was something to do with the cold war. Tinfoil? Antennae? The scaremongering that the KGB had listening devices hidden in cheese?
Never mind. The offending pineapples had found a purpose and we were all singing carols quite happily when there was a knock at the door. It turned out to be the Salvation Army, singing carols too.
This was reasonable. It was Christmas. But Mrs Winterson was having none of it. She opened the front door and shouted: “Jesus is here. Go away.”
When I went away after that Christmas I never went back. I never saw Mrs W again – she was soon too furious about my debut novel, Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit (1985). Quote: “It’s the first time I’ve had to order a book in a false name.”
As you get older you remember the dead at Christmas. The Celts, during their festival of Samhain, expected the dead to join the living. Many cultures would understand that; not ours.
That is a pity. And a loss. If time is a boomerang and not an arrow, then the past is always returning and repeating. Memory, as a creative act, allows us to reawaken the dead, or sometimes to lay them to rest, as at last we understand our past.
Last Christmas I was alone in my kitchen, the fire lit – I love having a fire in the kitchen. I was pouring myself a drink when Judy Garland came on the radio singing “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”. I remembered how Mrs W had played that song on the piano. It was one of those moments we all know, of sadness and sweetness mixed together. Regret? Yes, I think so, for everything we got wrong. But recognition too, because she was a remarkable woman. She deserved a miracle to get her out of her trapped life of no hope, no money, no possibility of change.
Fortunately, she got the miracle. Unfortunately, the miracle was me. I was the golden ticket. I could have taken her anywhere. She could have been free ...
The Christmas story of the Christ Child is complex. Here’s what it tell us about miracles.
Miracles are never convenient (the baby’s going to be born whether or not there’s a hotel room – and there isn’t).
Miracles are not what we expect (an obscure man and woman find themselves parenting the Saviour of the World).
Miracles detonate the existing situation – and the blow-up and the back-blast mean some people get hurt.
What is a miracle? A miracle is an intervention – it breaks through the space-time continuum. A miracle is an intervention that cannot be accounted for purely rationally. Chance and fate are in the mix. A miracle is a benign intervention, yes, but miracles are like the genie in the bottle – let them out and there’s a riot. You’ll get your three wishes, but a whole lot else besides.
Mrs W wanted a baby. She couldn’t have one. Along comes me – but as she often said, “The Devil led us to the wrong crib.” Satan as a faulty star.
Sometimes the thing we long for, the thing we need, the miracle we want, is right there in front of us, and we can’t see it, or we run the other way; or, saddest of all, we just don’t know what to do with it. Think how many people get the success they want, the partner they want, the money they want, and turn it into dust and ashes – like the fairy gold no one can spend.
So at this time of year I think about the Christmas story, and all the Christmas stories since. As a writer I know that we get along badly without space in our lives for imagination and reflection. Religious festivals were designed to be time outside of time. Time where ordinary time was subject to significant time. What we remember. What we invent.

The sights and sounds of Christmas in the capital reflect the place itself - an extraordinary montage of tradition and change, glamour, pathos, enterprise, curiosity, possibility, poignance and generosity. I asked student film maker Max Curwen-Bingley to collect some seasonal scenes from the city, concentrating on variety and musicality. Here’s what he found.
From Good King Wenceslas on Oxford Street to Oh Come All Ye Faithful in Trafalgar Square, with room for reggae at Oxford Circus too. That’s the spirit. Merry Christmas from London to readers everywhere.
After Helen Pidd and Yasser, her Syrian lodger, wrote about their house-share in January, they were inundated with offers of help, dinner invitations and football tickets. Readers asked how they, too, could host a refugee: an 89-year-old retired academic put up a friend of Yasser’s.
Burnage Academy, a boys’ school in south Manchester, invited Helen and Yasser to talk to their new-to-English students, then offered Yasser the opportunity to volunteer as a classroom assistant. Able, a private language school, gave him 10 hours a week free English tuition for as long as he wants it; Empowering Learning, a teacher-training consultancy in London, offered to sponsor Yasser through his teaching qualifications, so he could pick up the career he had so loved back home in Syria.
Yasser moved out in April, when his wife and toddler daughter arrived. They are now happily settled in north Manchester. He has a job stewarding for Manchester United and at Chester Races, and recently passed his driving test. After he left, Helen took in another refugee, a female academic from Damascus. She left in August and Helen is enjoying an empty house – for now.
In January, Duncan Campbell told the astonishing inside story of the £14m Hatton Garden jewellery heist. Readers commented that the article read like the plot of a thriller, and indeed it was optioned by Working Title Films. Filming plans are now under way, with James Marsh (The Theory Of Everything, Man On Wire) directing and Joe Penhall writing.
Mark Smith, a former soldier turned disabled bodybuilder, told Chris Stokel-Walker in January why he was planning to compete alongside able-bodied men in international contests. But a taster session for strongman training, where participants test their strength in challenges with extremely heavy weights, made him want to pursue that instead. In May, Smith won a national strongman contest; in August, he came sixth in the World’s Strongest Disabled Man competition. Next year, he’s aiming to win.
In February, Louise Tickle reported on one woman’s fight to get her baby son Huw returned from North Tyneside social services. Though her relationship with her own local authority is now, she says, “extremely tense”, “Annie” is in huge demand as a speaker by children’s services and university social work departments. She recently came off benefits to set up her own Surviving Safeguarding training and consultancy business, as well as an organisation to support parents in the care system. Her son, now three, is thriving in her care; her daughter Rosie, eight, has come home to live with Annie full-time.
At the end of October, Billy Muir – farmer, lighthouse keeper, firefighter, rare-breeds expert, air traffic controller, conservator, mechanic, binman, local councillor, builder, crofting commissioner, taxi driver, hotelier and unofficial president of the JCB fan club in Orkney, whom Bella Bathurst profiled in February, won a Pride of Britain award and met Theresa May at Downing Street. Still working at 67, Muir isn’t, he confessed, doing much to help lower the national retirement age. And nor will he for some time to come: his next goal is to buy a new digger.
When Myles and Erin Elton spoke to Kate Lyons in March for a story about male infertility, they had been trying to conceive their third child for nine months. Myles, 28, had been told at the age of 21 that, due to an illness he had suffered as a baby, he had only a 15% chance of ever having a child, with the likelihood greater while he and Erin were young. They had their first, Lucy, when they were 22; their second, Norah, two years later. They recently announced Erin is pregnant again; the baby is due in May.
In April, Simon Hattenstone met Sara Ryan, the mother of Connor Sparrowhawk, who drowned in a bath three years ago, aged 18, at a residential unit run by Southern Health, an NHS foundation trust. His death eventually led to the finding that Southern Health had, between 2011 and 2015, failed properly to investigate the deaths of more than 700 people with learning disabilities or mental health problems. In August, chief executive Katrina Percy stepped down, only to be given a new advisory role. In October, she left Southern Health; the trust’s board said public feedback had led it to decide it was “no longer possible for her to continue”.
In May, Annie Kelly and Mei-Ling McNamara investigated the case of four Bangladeshi men trafficked into slavery in a remote hotel in the Scottish Highlands. In 2008, they were deceived into paying thousands of pounds for a visa, only to find themselves doing forced labour and abused by their employer, who was later jailed for three years. Readers set up a crowdfunding site to help with legal fees, and raised nearly £12,000 in four weeks. MPs in Scotland appealed directly to the Home Office to grant the men the right to remain. Last month, despite their being recognised as victims of trafficking and having served as key witnesses in the prosecution of their trafficker, their applications were rejected. They are now on their final appeal and face deportation.
In July, after a gap of 13 years, John Vidal returned to Gumbi, the Malawian village where no child had ever had more than two years’ secondary schooling. Today the village is more optimistic. The money contributed by readers in 2003 has resulted in two schools being rebuilt. Without being asked, readers this year contributed a further £25,000, which means two community libraries can be built, equipped with books donated by Book Aid International.
In July, Simon Hattenstone spoke to the family of Michael Sandford, an autistic young man jailed in May for grabbing a gun at a Donald Trump rally in Las Vegas and saying he wanted to kill Trump. He was charged with disrupting an official function and two firearm offences. His mother, Lynne Sandford, revealed that Michael was suicidal. Readers raised more than £10,000 to help with his legal bills. This month, he was sentenced to 12 months in prison. Judge James Mahan told him: “You have a medical problem. You should not be ashamed or embarrassed about it… I don’t think you wanted to kill anybody.” Lynne Sandford was hugely touched by the support from readers, saying, “Michael passes on his sincerest thanks. I’m glad readers realise that, despite what he attempted to do, he’s not a bad person at heart.”
In August, novelist Mary Paulson-Ellis followed the story of Mr Lobban, an elderly man who died in Edinburgh with no next-of-kin and an ambiguous identity. Several people who knew him got in touch. Buff Hardie, an undergraduate with Mr Lobban at Aberdeen University in the early 50s, described a young man with “a flawless Oxbridge accent”, often the target of a gossip column in the student newspaper.
An email from Douglas Cameron placed Lobban next in Cambridge, a dapper man “like a young David Suchet playing Poirot”, teaching English as a foreign language. The first sighting of him in Edinburgh is in the 70s, remembered as someone “well-informed and amusing”, but skilled at deflecting questions.
Mr Lobban’s neighbour of 20 years got in touch to say she found him charming, though eccentric. He was a divisive figure, especially latterly, when his hoarding became extreme. She discovered a Jewish genealogy website detailing the fate of his father, Martin Krebs, who died at Auschwitz in 1944. Paulson-Ellis says, “It was a thrill to hear from those who knew Mr Lobban – an afterlife of sorts for the article and for him.”
Fifty-two matches, various kisses (some more awkward than others) and a handful of second dates: Cupid has had a busy year in our Blind date column. We can happily report that Tom and Emily (29 October) are still dating, even though he forgot her name the first time. “I’ve worn my full hi-vis cycle look in front of him,” Emily says, “and it didn’t put him off.”
Michael’s date with Rebecca (9 April) also led to a match – with a friend of a friend saw the article and got in touch. “I will always remember 2016 as the year when a reckless gamble paid off,” Michael says. “So if you’re in two minds, take the plunge.”

Born in Edinburgh, Irvine Welsh was working for the council and studying for an MBA at Heriot-Watt University when he wrote Trainspotting. Published in 1993, the novel was a hit, and in 1996 was made into a film by Danny Boyle. A sequel is released next month, and an immersive theatre adaptation of the original book runs at The Vaults, London SE1, until 15 January. Welsh’s latest novel, The Blade Artist, was published this year. He is married for the second time and lives in Chicago.
When were you happiest? 
Happiness is mostly intrinsic: you’re either a happy soul or a miserable bastard. Fortunately, I’m the former.

Which living person do you most admire, and why?
Artists who do their own thing, without compromise: Ken Loach, Bob Dylan and James Kelman.
What was your most embarrassing moment?
One place I worked, the boss asked how I was getting on. I told him about one woman who was a nightmare. His face went ashen. I later found out she was his wife.

What is the worst thing anyone’s said to you?
“I just don’t recognise you any more and I don’t want to spend any more time getting to know an unlikable stranger who is the very same as every other drug addict.” That was devastatingly hard to take, but it was (eventually) very helpful.
What is your guiltiest pleasure?
A chocolate doughnut, after my boxing training.
What does love feel like?
When you can barely stand to look at someone without turning away to catch your breath.

What is the worst job you’ve done?
Laying down slabs for the council.
How often do you have sex?
If I don’t have sex every day, I start to go a bit weird. It makes travelling difficult.

What do you consider your greatest achievement?
I haven’t achieved anything of note yet.
What has been your biggest disappointment?
There’s been the odd beauty on the dance floor I really ought to have gone home with.
It’s Christmas Eve, and you need to spruce up the house for tomorrow, but the shops are heaving and you don’t want to venture out. What to do? It’s time to get creative with whatever you can find in your house and garden.
If your Christmas table is looking bare, raid your garden for greenery and make a centrepiece in minutes. Flower farmer and florist Georgie Newbery of Common Farm Flowers recommends using a bucket, jug or deep bowl (a cut-glass trifle bowl, say) rather than a vase. Use Blu-Tack to secure a candle or three (either stout church candles or dipped candles) in the base, and make a grid out of sticky tape across the top of the container to keep the candles and foliage upright. Fill the bowl with water, then pick a huge bunch of whatever’s looking good (Newbery suggests hazel catkins, flowering viburnums, ivy berries, willow stems, pittosporum and griselinia); slot them into the grid of tape around the candles.
Make holly leaf place cards. Cut holly-shaped leaves in red and green card, fold in half lengthways, and write place names (ideally in a metallic pen) on the side that’s standing up.
Alternatively, create rosemary sprig placeholders. Cut card into squares; collect small sprigs of rosemary from the garden, leaving a twiggy end; attach this onto the top corner of each card using fancy tape; and write on guests’ names.
Scatter the table with the littlest pine cones you can find. Even better, dip them in gold paint.
Fetch a branch from the garden; apple tree prunings and stems of Japanese quince work well, but anything will do. Place in a heavy, wide-based vase or pot and weigh down with as much ballast as you can to stop it toppling over. Cover in silver or white paint, or leave it natural, particularly if it is crusted with lichen. Hang with your most beautiful baubles. Alternatively, decorate a large houseplant: think swiss cheese plant (Monstera deliciosa), pothos vine or weeping fig (Ficus benjamina).
If you have a tree that’s looking rather bare, raid the bathroom cabinet for cotton wool balls. Set any relatives who are at a loose end to work – thread a needle with cotton, sew through the balls, and dot them round the tree. Hey presto, soft, fluffy snowballs. Alternatively, enlist children to help bake gingerbread men. Make a hole in the top before you bake them, then when they’re cool, ice in festive colours and thread leftover ribbon through to hang from the branches. Complete the homemade look with orange (or satsuma, or clementine) slice decorations. Cut an unpeeled fruit into round slices, bake on a low heat for a couple of hours to dry out, then thread some ribbon or twine through the top of each slice.
If you have a spare large, plain bauble, either plastic or glass, you can make a personalised decoration that can double as an impromptu gift. Dig out a paint set, and paint a child or adult’s hand all over with white acrylic paint – do this by the sink so they can wash their hands as soon as you are finished. Get them to grasp the bauble lightly but firmly from below so they make a hand print, with the palm covering the base and the fingers pointing towards the top. Once this is completely dry, use permanent markers to turn each finger into a jolly snowman: pebble smile, carrot nose, hat, scarf and so on. There are lots of good examples online, if you want a visual guide. This can also serve as a last-minute present for grandparents.
Dawn Isaac, author of 101 Things For Kids To Do Outside, suggests raiding the garden for twigs to make star decorations; lash them together with twine, string or ribbons. Any pliable twig will do, but red or yellow dogwood stems or bright green willows look particularly eye-catching.
You can also make simple wreaths by bending some stems into a circle and binding them with twine, then adorning with fluffy clematis seedheads, dried chillies, pine cones and anything else you can lay your hands on.
If you have wire hanging baskets left over from summer, lash a couple together into a globe shape using wire or even cable ties. Wrap them in outdoor fairy lights and hang by the front door.
If you need to add some glamour to a parcel, turn to nature. Evergreen foliage such as ivy, fern leaves, sprigs of conifer or eucalyptus or even your Christmas tree make simple, stylish adornments: bind them to presents with twine or ribbon. Try graphic designer Twan van Keulen’s trick of cutting letters from large leathery leaves using a craft knife. Use the letters to make up names to stick on to parcels.
If you’ve forgotten a gift for a loved one and don’t fancy shops full of panicked present-buyers, Alys Fowler suggests putting together bouquets garnis of fresh herbs. Cut small sprigs of rosemary, a bay leaf or two, sage, parsley and thyme from the garden (or from pots in the kitchen) and tie tightly with kitchen string at the base. For a neater look, wrap a bay leaf around the base of the bunch, then wrap the string tightly around several times.
Alys also recommends digging up some bulbs that are just starting to poke their heads above the soil (snowdrops or early crocuses are ideal) and potting them into a pretty container small enough to perch on a windowsill: forced this way they should burst into flower for a little cheer before it all really happens outside. Happy Christmas!
On the evening of 8 November, the world gathered in front of TV screens for the news. In the early hours of 9 November, it began to dawn on us that what we were watching was no longer news but history. Not since 9/11 could many recall such a sense of incredulous dread, and as Florida fell to Donald Trump, I found myself seized by an eerie premonition. I saw schoolchildren turning over history examination papers in the future, to find a question as predictable and familiar to their generation as one about the origins of the second world war had been to mine: “Identify and analyse the parallels,” it would read, “between the 1930s and the 2010s.”
No one yet knows how 2016 will be remembered, and if Boris Johnson turns out to be right, we will wonder why anyone ever worried about the arrival of another “liberal guy from New York” in the White House. If, however, pupils do one day have to answer that exam question, they might well begin by observing that we were every bit as slow as our forefathers to recognise impending catastrophe.
When David Cameron returned from Brussels in February, brandishing his peace-in-our-time renegotiated EU membership terms – can anyone now even remember what they were? – it looked as if the referendum promised nothing more sinister than the entertaining spectacle of the government tearing itself apart. No one was surprised to see Iain Duncan Smith, Chris Grayling, John Whittingdale and Theresa Villiers side with Vote Leave, but Michael Gove’s defection was a bombshell. When Johnson followed a day later, “after a huge amount of heartache”, the audacity of the pretence that he was acting on deeply held anti-EU conviction fooled nobody. As the columnist Nick Cohen put it after the vote, “There are liars, and then there’s Boris.”
In Johnson’s defence, he wasn’t the only one exploiting Europe for personal ambition. Cameron’s motives for calling the referendum had little to do with principle and everything to do with neutralising Ukip’s threat and silencing internal dissent. Europe had been a toxic nuisance to Tory leaders for 40 years, and back in 2006 Cameron famously blamed “banging on about Europe” for his party’s unpopularity (“Instead of talking about the things that most people care about,” he declared, “we talked about what we cared about most”). By the time the campaign began, fevered speculation about its implications for the Tories left little room for much thought about the damage it could do to the country.
The remain campaign imagined they’d put this right by orchestrating a chorus of hair-raising warnings. Everyone from Mark Carney to Richard Branson, the TUC to the IMF, warned of economic Armageddon. Such a powerful consensus seemed so self-evidently persuasive to remain campaigners that when voters said they were fed up with Project Fear, they refused to believe them and wheeled out President Obama, only to give leave another boost in the polls. “Bring Obama back again!” Nigel Farage gloated gleefully. “Let’s have another visit!” The then Ukip leader was more attuned than most to the new populist mood of anti-elite resentment; and when Gove told us “the people of this country have had enough of experts”, liberals were so quick to ridicule him that few considered the possibility he might, in fact, be right.
In a year when the phrase “post-truth” entered the Oxford Dictionary, and fake news helped win the White House, facts were at best worthless and at worst a liability. Once again, many of us were slow to grasp the implications of this new paradigm. Focus groups of undecided voters told remain’s leaders that their minds would be made up by hard facts – and were taken at their word. Remain duly kept churning out data – Brexit would cost “£4,300 per household”, claimed George Osborne – apparently unaware that no one likes to think, let alone admit, that what really informs their decisions is much more elusive and emotional. In the febrile new mood of 2016, remain’s threat that you would lose “vital EU funding for the farming, scientific and medical research and programmes that make a real difference in your local community” was no match for the potent promise of leave’s “Take back control”.
For a fleeting moment, the campaign seemed almost festive, when Bob Geldof and Farage traded insults across the Thames from rival flotillas. The leave boats had Joey Essex on board, while the 60s soul song The In Crowd blasted out from Geldof’s. The referendum had everyone talking, and optimists could feasibly mistake the national conversation for a unifying moment. But seven days before the vote, the mood darkened. Ukip revealed its infamous Breaking Point poster, an almost exact copy of footage from a Nazi propaganda film; hours later, an idealistic young pro-EU Labour MP was shot and stabbed to death on the street in her constituency by a Nazi sympathiser shouting “Britain first”. Even Farage privately admitted that Jo Cox’s murder would finish off leave’s chances, and liberals, though deeply shaken, assumed such grotesque ugliness couldn’t fail to bring the country to its senses. All the polls agreed.
They were wrong. On 23 June, 52% of us chose instead to vote for chaos; by breakfast the following morning, the prime minister had resigned, and even Johnson and Gove looked shell-shocked. Within days, they would destroy one another in a Shakespearean bloodbath to succeed Cameron. Once Andrea Leadsom’s misapprehension that motherhood qualified her for the job had ruled her out, Theresa May was the only one left standing, and thus became our new prime minister.
But if the Tories’ leadership race was unedifying, Labour MPs could only look on with envy. Incensed by Jeremy Corbyn’s absenteeism during the referendum campaign, more than 60 resigned from the shadow front bench, and days later 172 voted no confidence in their leader. Corbynistas retaliated with a torrent of online abuse, much of it violent and misogynistic, and a brick through leadership challenger Angela Eagle’s window put paid to any hope of a “kinder, gentler politics”. After an inflammatory summer of courtroom battles, allegations of MI5 infiltrators, rock star-style Corbyn rallies and squabbles over a £25 fee to vote, Corbyn was duly re-elected Labour leader, and promptly vanished from view again.
Historians will probably argue for ever about why we voted to leave the EU, but none could conclude that immigration played little part. The 58% spike in hate crimes that followed the vote only confirmed what the result had already told us: our compassion for migrants had curdled into fearful hostility as the crisis in mainland Europe spiralled. Hungary declared a nationwide state of emergency, and Italy replaced Greece as the people traffickers’ destination of choice, with 180,000 reaching its shores this year. The likelihood of drowning while crossing the Med narrowed from the previous year’s record of one in 269, to just one in 88; but sympathy hardened as the crisis became fatally entwined in public minds with the Islamic terror attacks rocking the continent.
Seven of the nine jihadis who attacked Paris late last year, killing 130, were reported to have smuggled themselves into Europe disguised as Syrian refugees. In March, Brussels became the next target, when bombs at the airport and a metro station killed more than 30 and injured 300. But July was to be the deadliest month: Bastille Day celebrations on a balmy night in Nice became a massacre when a Tunisian man drove a truck into the crowds, killing 86 and injuring more than 400. Twelve days later, two 19-year-old jihadis forced an 85-year-old priest to kneel at his own altar in a Normandy church and slit his throat. In Germany, an Afghan asylum seeker ran amok with an axe on a train, a Syrian refugee blew up a wine bar, another hacked a colleague to death with a machete, and a German-Iranian teenage gunman went on a rampage, killing nine. Earlier this week, a Tunisian asylum seeker was was shot dead by Italian police after being identified as the man who drove a truck into a Berlin Christmas market, killing at least 12 people.
Measures that would only recently have been unthinkable were passed with little public protest. Denmark introduced a law authorising the confiscation of jewellery and cash from asylum seekers to pay for their care, undeterred by UN warnings against fuelling “fear and xenophobia”. French seaside resorts imposed a burkini ban, leading to the surreal spectacle of armed policemen ordering Muslim women on beaches to undress, which was reversed not by public revulsion (opinion polls found two-thirds of French people in favour) but a court ruling. When the migrant camp in Calais was bulldozed, Britain agreed to take its unaccompanied minors, only for our tabloids to whip up outrage about arrivals who didn’t “look” under 18. A Tory backbencher proposed subjecting them to dental tests, to determine if they were deserving of British kindness.
The three biggest nationalities pouring into Europe were fleeing conflicts caused by events long predating 2016 and not confined within their borders. Fifteen years after western coalition forces first sought revenge for 9/11, Afghanistan and Iraq remain locked in bloody turmoil, but it was the tragedy of Syria that horrified the world this year. Five years into civil war, the president, Bashar al-Assad, remained undefeated and the international community paralysed, unable to decide which, if any, side to support.
Diplomatic scruples did not inhibit Vladimir Putin, who was all too happy to fill the vacuum. Any hope that Russian airstrikes on Syria would be confined to Isis targets soon faded as Moscow subjected eastern Aleppo to the same ruthless bombardment that had once reduced Grozny to rubble. Cluster and barrel bombs rained down on civilian homes and hospitals, even a UN aid convoy, rendering Aleppo our Guernica and killing more civilians, according to one NGO monitoring the war (the UN-sanctioned Syrian Network for Human Rights), than even Isis has. The world was shaken by footage of a shell-shocked five-year-old boy being pulled from the wreckage of his home, coated in grey dust, dazed – but still it wasn’t moved to act. “All the world has failed us,” a resident of Aleppo despaired. “The city is dying. Rapidly by bombardment, and slowly by hunger and fear of the advance of the Assad regime.” As the year drew to a close, the fall of Aleppo to Assad became inevitable, and from the ruins of one of the world’s oldest cities rose a resurgent Kremlin, restored as a global superpower.
A once faintly ridiculous figure, mocked in the west for his fondness for posing topless, Putin could plausibly claim to be the most influential world leader of 2016. For the first time in history, a Russian president was accused of deploying cyber warfare to influence the outcome of a US presidential election. Putin denied the CIA’s charge, but few in Washington doubted that he was behind the Russian hackers who infiltrated Democratic National Committee email servers and the private email account of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, releasing material calculated to embarrass and undermine their candidate. Her rival had even urged Moscow to hack her account: “Russia, if you’re listening,” he declared at a press conference in July, “I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.” In the words of one stunned Clinton aide: “This has to be the first time that a major presidential candidate has actively encouraged a foreign power to conduct espionage against his political opponent.”
But it was only one of many firsts in a US presidential election unlike any the world had seen. When Donald J Trump entered the race, few imagined the reality star and property tycoon with four business bankruptcies and two ex-wives behind him stood a chance against the most qualified Democratic candidate in history. This would be the year America elected its first female president, not the first leader of the free world to have never held public office. Pundits shook their heads and laughed back in January when Trump told a rally, “I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose any voters.” Who was he kidding? Every bizarre step he took towards November’s vote was judged by sniggering pundits to be leading him farther from the White House.
Build a wall on the Mexican border to keep out all those Latino rapists? The idea was surely absurd. Punish women for having abortions? Even pro-lifers were appalled. July’s Republican Convention was meant to confer respectability on Trump’s maverick campaign, but unravelled into farce after his wife, Melania, delivered a speech lifted verbatim from one Michelle Obama made eight years earlier. Matters only got worse when Trump launched a Twitter attack on the Muslim parents of a US soldier killed fighting in Iraq. The following week he suggested a Clinton presidency could be dealt with by “the Second Amendment people”, by which he could only mean that they assassinate her.
When a tape emerged of Trump boasting in 2005 about grabbing women “by the pussy” and getting away with it because he was famous, he retaliated by inviting three women who had accused Bill Clinton of inappropriate sexual conduct to the next presidential debate. The tape was nothing but “locker room banter”, Trump scoffed, showcasing his unparalleled gift for post-truth politics with the solemn assertion: “Nobody has more respect for women than I do.” He announced his intention to jail Clinton if he won. Even George W Bush’s former secretary for homeland security was appalled: “It smacks of what we read about tinpot dictators in other parts of the world.”
Trump dismissed as “liars” the 12 women who came forward to accuse him of having acted out his banter. Some, he sneered, weren’t even good-looking enough for him to sexually assault. “Look at her,” he mocked one. Of another: “That would not be my first choice.” In the campaign’s final weeks, what caution he ever had was thrown to the wind, as he led rallies in a mob chant of “Lock her up!”, “Build that wall!” and “Drain the swamp!” Channelling his new best friend Farage, he urged America to make 8 November “our independence day”.
As Noam Chomsky observed, “Every time Trump makes a nasty comment about whoever, his popularity goes up. Because it’s based on hate, you know. Hate and fear,” he warned, “reminiscent of something unpleasant: Germany, not many years ago.” Yet even at the 11th hour, when the FBI reopened its investigation into Clinton’s private email server, the polls still assured the world Trump could not win. And then, on 8 November, a man widely described as a sociopathic bully, grandiose narcissist, dangerous demagogue and pathological liar, who scored higher than Hitler in an Oxford University study of psychopathic tendencies, became the 45th president of the USA. It was indeed “Brexit plus plus plus”, celebrated by America’s white supremacist “alt-right” movement with cries of “Hail Trump!” and rigid one-armed Nazi salutes. In the words of veteran constitutional historian Professor Vernon Bogdanor, Trump’s election was “the most troubling political event in my lifetime. It’s not difficult to arouse nationalist passions. We saw that in the 1930s.”
The world waits to see whether President Trump will govern as he campaigned. So far he has appointed a Texan oilman and Putin ally as secretary of state, put a retired general nicknamed Mad Dog in charge of defence, a climate change denier in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency, and chosen for his chief strategist the head of Breitbart news. His foreign heroes are Putin and Farage, and his preferred medium for conducting international diplomacy is Twitter. At the very moment when America’s system of checks and balances has never been more necessary, his party controls the White House, the house and the senate.
Meanwhile, the global institutions designed to keep us safe are in trouble. The UN secretary general used to be a household name, but Ban Ki-moon’s only discernible achievement in eight years was to make himself and the UN so invisible that most of the world would struggle to recognise, let alone name, his successor taking office in January. (It’s António Guterres.) The head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, has gone on trial in France charged with criminal negligence, and Nato’s member states have failed to pay their dues for so long that they could hardly be surprised by Trump’s reluctance to carry on bankrolling an “obsolete” institution costing the US “a fortune”. The fourth estate’s future has become increasingly fragile, too, as readers and viewers defected to the raunchier wilds of social media, and politicians from left and right discovered they could escape scrutiny from the mainstream media by simply snubbing it. When Facebook is the primary source of many voters’ news, and a conspiracy theory as crazy as Pizzagate (which linked Hillary Clinton and other Democrats to a child-abuse network run from a Washington pizzeria) can command global attention, how the powerful will be held to account is no longer clear.
If western liberal democracy reached its high point with the fall of the Berlin Wall, by the end of this year its very survival began to look in doubt. As Timothy Garton Ash put it, 2016 was “1989 in reverse”. The far right is on the rise across Europe; Marine Le Pen is a frontrunner in 2017’s French presidential election; and even if Angela Merkel holds on to power next year, the anti-immigration, populist, far-right Alternative for Germany is predicted to win seats in the Bundestag. It is with this fractured and fractious EU that Britain will negotiate the terms of its departure, cheered on by flag-waving tabloids, unconstrained by a functioning opposition, and we will finally find out what “Brexit means Brexit” means.
How did all of this happen? Following David Bowie’s death in January, and Britain’s vote to leave in June, the actor Paul Bettany tweeted one suggestion: “In January I dismissed my mate’s theory that David Bowie was the glue holding the universe together but I don’t know man... I don’t know.” After so many shockwaves and dramas, it was tempting to view the year as a freak surge of ahistorical exceptionalism, analogous to nothing and a law unto itself. History will see it differently. Just as the legacy of the great crash of 1929 took several years to manifest itself, so the consequences of the financial crash of 2008 are only now becoming clear. There was nothing magical or inexplicable about 2016. We were merely reminded of what happens when most of us do not have enough money, and a few of us have much too much.

With a smile as brilliant as her gold and green headtie, Margaret praised the Lord. “We never imagined we would see this day,” she said. “With the help of God, we were able to come out of bondage.” Around her, another 20 young women and their relatives, many in equally spectacular traditional dress provided by delighted authorities, danced and sang, and sometimes sobbed.
For more than two years, the girls, from a small Christian town in the predominantly Muslim far north-east of Nigeria, had been held by Boko Haram, the Islamic militant group linked to Islamic State. They were among more than 250 female students abducted from their school during a night raid in April 2014. At least 50 managed to escape hours after the attack, but the rest, kept by their captors in a series of forest camps, were given a choice: convert and marry, or become a servant.
The mass abduction prompted a global outcry, and an international campaign to #BringBackOurGirls. Yet the story slipped from the headlines. Desultory negotiations for the girls’ release went nowhere. The bloody campaign against the militants ground on, with some success but no sign of the students, other than a glimpse in a propaganda video released by the extremists. Some were said to have been killed in a government bombing; others by disease. Two made their own way to freedom, one with a child fathered by a militant. But the rest remained.
The girls were released on 13 October, after weeks of talks brokered by western officials, and flown to the capital, Abuja, where they received medical attention and counselling. Their families, travelling from Chibok, faced a 500-mile drive on potholed roads, slowed by military checkpoints and the fear of attack by insurgents. But they made it at last, embracing their children in emotional scenes at a church service.
Almost immediately came more worries. The father of one of the girls told reporters he was concerned their release would be exploited for political gain. “People’s children are not money, people’s children are not clothes you wear to campaign,” he said. “People’s children are their pride.”
Other observers quietly pointed out that the girls who had escaped earlier had faced ostracism and abuse. Mausi Segun, a researcher in Nigeria for Human Rights Watch, said the negative reaction of conservative communities would mean it was unlikely those released would be able to return to Chibok. “Any sign that there has been sexual contact with any man – and these men are Boko Haram – will cause a backlash. The likelihood they will return home is slim.” There have been reports that many of those still in captivity, aware of the stigmatisation they will face, were unwilling to return to their communities.
But on that day in October, there was simple celebration, and the problems to come were forgotten. Jason Burke. Margaret is a pseudonym
“The Ross Sea is a polar garden of Eden – it’s truly astonishing when you sail there,” Lewis Pugh says. A British endurance swimmer who has plunged into icy waters around the world in the name of conservation, he says this part of Antarctica deserves its reputation for being one of the few almost pristine ecosystems left in the world.
“You see humpback whales, leopard seals, Adélie and Emperor penguins and albatrosses. You get a feel for what the world used to be like before man put his and her hand on it,” the 47-year-old says.
On 1 December 2017, 1.5m sq km of the region will be declared a marine protected area (MPA), with two-thirds off limits to fishing, under an agreement reached in October. Illegal fishing in the area has devastated stocks of the Patagonian toothfish, which led Prince Charles to write to government ministers, pleading with them to save the species and the birds that depend on it.
Reaching consensus on the MPA’s creation was tortuous, with Russia and China blocking a deal for years. That’s partly why conservationists celebrated 2016’s breakthrough so loudly. “It’s hugely significant and historic, and not just because of the number of players,” says Andrea Kavanagh, an Antarctic expert at Pew Charitable Trusts, of the EU and 24 other nations involved. “This was also the first time a multilateral body [CCAMLR] had decided to protect the high seas in a huge way.”
While John Kerry, the US secretary of state, lobbied the Chinese, Pugh’s job was to meet and persuade the top levels of Russian government using his brand of “Speedo diplomacy”. “I think the real tipping point was when Putin appointed Sergei Ivanov as ecologist tsar,” the swimmer says. A former chief of staff for Putin, Ivanov is “passionate about the environment” and a “very hands-on, practical type of person”, Pugh says.
Both Kavanagh and Pugh see the deal as a victory not just for the environment, but for international cooperation. “It’s a sign of hope in a very difficult year,” Kavanagh says. “There are still things all countries can agree on together.”
“We can still see Antarctica as a place for peace- and bridge-building,” Pugh agrees.
Conservationists have their sights set on three more MPAs around Antarctica, and Pugh is back among the wild waves to campaign for them. After speaking to the Guardian from Cape Horn, he swam around the tip of South America, only to have to get back into the roiling waters a second time; he had misjudged the distance and stopped 150m short on his first attempt.

BBC1 could have broadcast round-the-clock coverage of vomit slowly evaporating on a hot pavement that second weekend of November and we’d have fallen to our knees, thankful for the distraction. Instead, just when we needed it most, we got a full-strength punch of joy: Ed Balls dancing Gangnam Style on Strictly Come Dancing.
Find a video of the routine and look at his face. Look into his eyes. This is the former chair of the Fabian Society, indiscriminately smashing his hips around to a song about overt consumerism. His cheeks are puffed out, and he’s mouthing the word “bum” over and over again. At one point, he hops up and down like a happy little horse, while his partner kicks and flails between his legs. This is the former cabinet minister, a senior fellow at Harvard, jerking around as if he’s being defibrillated – and it might count as the best thing he’s ever done.
That same weekend, the BBC broadcast footage of a bear, pole dancing against a tree, captured during the making of Planet Earth II. The impact was the same – a powerful figure cutting loose and making a fool of itself – but the context subtly different. That bear had no cultural touch points. It needed to scratch its back. Balls, though? He was doing the whole thing on purpose.
Two weeks later, he was eliminated from Strictly, and Planet Earth II once again became a show about scorpions stabbing bats in the head. Bloody 2016. Stuart Heritage
The invisible machinations of “PJS”, the showbiz spouse who this year persuaded the courts to prevent reporting of a threesome, renewed discussion about whether there is a human right to a private life. Meanwhile, a number of artists and broadcasters made their claim on a private death: Terry Wogan, Alan Rickman, David Bowie, Victoria Wood, Caroline Aherne and Ronnie Corbett all died from terminal illnesses in such a way that the news came as a terrible shock. Leonard Cohen had inadvertently let the raven out of the bag, telling the New Yorker that he was “ready to die” just before he did; but he won a victory for privacy by managing to die in Los Angeles and be buried in Montreal, before either event was reported.
Cohen and Bowie were remarkable for having achieved the artistic equivalent of putting their affairs in order: both wrote and recorded albums that they knew to be final testaments; each dropped a hint derived from scripture. Bowie’s Blackstar, released three days before his death, featured the song Lazarus, (“Look at me, I’m in Heaven”), while Cohen’s You Want It Darker, released 17 days before the singer died, employs as a chorus “Hineni”, or “Here I am”, the Hebrew words used by Moses and Abraham when called by God.
Rickman also left a memorial for his fans, playing a British general in the excellent and posthumously released movie, Eye In The Sky. Wogan had just published his first book of fiction, a form in which he had long wanted to write. Wood was so private her friends say she would not want her final weeks to be discussed, even posthumously. More importantly, all the quietly departed seem, from the accounts that have emerged, to have had the conversations and made the last arrangements they wanted.
This autumn, the BBC broadcaster Steve Hewlett and the writer AA Gill chose the opposite approach, writing or talking publicly about their experiences as late-stage cancer patients. Both routes towards the exit should be available, but the discreet path has opened up in a way that few would have imagined possible for the very famous. In the year of Brexit, hard or soft, the quiet exit became a way of death. Mark Lawson
In a year that will be remembered for the normalisation of bigotry, it was uplifting to hear a member of the royal family condemn racism and sexism. For any lucky sod who hibernated through the year, Prince Harry’s new girlfriend Meghan Markle is, controversially, a US actor who has removed items of clothing on screen. Even more controversially, she is a divorcee. And most controversial of all, she is mixed race.
The Sun ran a front page story with the headline “HARRY GIRL’S ON PORNHUB”, a reference to the internet pornography site that featured her in clips from the TV series Suits. A number of newspapers noted with surprise that she was a “brunette”, which appeared to be a euphemism of sorts. The Daily Mail ran a story headlined “Harry’s girl is (almost) straight outta Compton”. And that headline is (almost) straight outta the textbook of racist stereotyping.
Prince Harry responded with a statement commenting on “the wave of abuse and harassment” to which Markle had been subjected, referring to “the smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments”.
I’ve always associated the British royal family with fuelling prejudice rather than combating it: from the Queen Mother supporting white supremacist rule in Rhodesia and telling Woodrow Wyatt she had “some reservations about Jews”; to Prince Philip telling a student in China, “If you stay here much longer, you’ll go home with slitty eyes”; to Harry himself in a swastika armband at a fancy dress party in 2005, and talking of a fellow soldier as “our little Paki friend” in 2009.
Harry’s swastika was offensive and stupid, as was his racist description of the soldier. And yes, he might only have condemned the press this time because it was personal. But the fact is, he spoke out against racism, and as far as I know that is a first for Britain’s royal family. He deserves a big pat on his overprivileged back. Simon Hattenstone
For Americans expecting shattered glass on 8 November, the election of Donald Trump was devastating. But the night did usher in a handful of Democratic women whose elections broke barriers and made history.
Pramila Jayapal was the first Indian-American woman elected to the US House of Representatives. Having immigrated to the US from India at 16, election night was “bittersweet” for her. The team learned of Jayapal’s victory just as the news networks declared Trump the next president. “It is not the Congress I wanted to come into, but I’ve never backed down from a fight before, and I won’t start now,” Jayapal tells me.
Democrats are preparing for long battles over equal rights and justice. “I will fight to make sure we don’t backtrack on the human and civil rights of our people,” says Oregon governor Kate Brown, who is bisexual and the nation’s first openly LGBT governor. Minnesota elected Ilhan Omar as state representative, the first female Somali-American Muslim lawmaker.
These elections, alongside those of Kamala Harris in California, who became the first Indian-American senator, and Tammy Duckworth in Illinois, the first Thai-American senator, were celebrated as glimmers of hope in the face of Trump’s victory.
As was Nevada’s election of Catherine Cortez Masto, the first Latina in the US Senate. “I have received letters and emails from little girls who are excited to see a woman in a big role,” she says. “It’s humbling.” Lauren Gambino
In a year when the liberal left lost elections across the globe, would anyone have batted an eyelid if Austria, of all places, had presented the EU with its first far-right head of state of the postwar era?
In May, Norbert Hofer, the youthful, puppy-eyed deputy leader of the anti-immigration Freedom party, lost the presidential vote by the narrowest of margins. Then, thanks to irregularities in the postal vote count, his party won an appeal for a rerun and everything seemed to be going in their favour: a year of campaigning had softened the radical right’s image and most polls had Hofer ahead. And yet, on 4 December, Austria bucked the western trend, sidelining Hofer in favour of Alexander Van der Bellen, a former leader of the Green party, who had run as an independent.
To call it a sea change might be to overstate it (after all, 46.2% of Austrians voted for a candidate from a party founded by former Nazis) but there’s a positive here that should not be forgotten. Van der Bellen, 72, a mellow retired economist, gave a glimpse of what unusual shapes the fightback against rightwing populism can take. An unshaven chain-smoker from a disadvantaged background, with an aversion to buzzwords, he was arguably a better “anti-establishment” candidate than Hofer, who entered political life at 23 and worked as a rhetoric coach. Van der Bellen ran a positive, inclusive campaign, summed up by his slogan: “Those who love their homeland don’t divide it.”
A clear majority of female voters (62%, up from 54% in May) voted for him. One, an 89-year-old Holocaust survivor, approached Van der Bellen’s campaign the week before the election. The resulting video, in which she warned that Hofer’s party brought out “the basest in people, not the decent, but the indecent”, became a viral hit and may have helped swing the vote in the liberal candidate’s favour. Philip Oltermann
Just when we thought reality television couldn’t sink any lower, having delivered a summer of public sex followed by public shaming, the unexpected happened: the 16th season of I’m A Celebrity… featured a bunch of polite people getting along very nicely. And hugging a lot.
“I think it was just what the country needed,” says Joel Dommett, the comedian who came second in the contest. “Viewers enjoyed watching people having nice conversations around a campfire. I sat there thinking, ‘I am being horrifically unentertaining’, but everyone seems to have enjoyed it.”
It was an unlikely group of new BFFs. The 69-year-old actor Larry Lamb became a second father to the street dancer Jordan Banjo. Gogglebox star (and eventual winner) Scarlett Moffatt was delightfully starstruck by Carol Vorderman as they ate turkey testicles and camel nipples. Even the bloke from Homes Under The Hammer eventually stopped whining and became agreeable. “He was the first person in the camp who wasn’t positive,” Dommett says, “but we sort of infected him with our positivity, and then he was flying.”
Did the producers deliberately cast an uncontentious group as a tonic to a year overrun by conflict? Or, more likely, did they just strike a bit dull? Either way, the result was unexpectedly heartwarming. As Dommett says, “People were just being normal and real with each other. Instead of pissing on the street and giving blowjobs in a hot tub.” Abigail Radnor

Thousands of Britons are killed on the road every year. It’s one of those things we seem to have quietly accepted as the cost of modernity, alongside climate change, internet piracy and Facebook. So it’s odd to think that, within a decade, road deaths could plausibly be a thing of the past. Self-driving cars have the potential to reshape society, leading to a world in which the boundaries blur between public and private vehicles, ownership and hire, delivery and transportation. But before they have any of those effects, they will hopefully save the lives of tens of thousands of people around the globe.
By the end of 2017, we’ll have a better idea of how this is going to shake out. This coming year will be a gamechanger for self-driving cars, with Tesla Motors ramping up its Autopilot programme and shipping the first of its Model 3 cars; Google potentially spinning out its own project into a stand-alone company; and the rapid proliferation of other organisations working in the same space, from Oxford University to San Franciscan startups.
The safety potential of self-driving cars took a knock in 2016, when Tesla Motors admitted to the first fatal crash involving the company’s Autopilot feature. Joshua Brown, who owned an Autopilot-enabled Tesla Model S, was killed when his car ploughed into the side of a truck. Brown’s death forced Tesla to re-emphasise that the Autopilot feature, as it currently exists, isn’t self-driving. Instead, it’s a driver-assist feature: it still requires a qualified driver to supervise and take over in the case of a mistake.
Some companies developing real self-driving technology disagree with this approach. For Google, whose X labs have been developing self-driving cars since 2012, there’s no point shipping such vehicles until they don’t need a driver at all.
But even a driver-assist feature may still end up saving huge numbers of lives. As of July, when Tesla went public about Brown’s death, a cumulative 130m miles had been driven with Autopilot turned on. Among normal American drivers, there’s a fatality roughly once every 94m miles. A robot doesn’t get drunk, distracted or drowsy and its reactions can be faster than are humanly possible.
The numbers carried on getting better and better for Tesla. Six months later, and hundreds of millions more miles have been driven with Autopilot turned on, yet no other confirmed fatality has been reported. A revolution has quietly begun. Alex Hern

It wasn’t supposed to play out this way. At 5.05pm in Augusta, Georgia, on Sunday 10 April, there was no indication that it would. No Englishman had won the Masters, arguably golf’s most coveted individual event, since 1996. The American Jordan Spieth, who held a five-stroke lead, was in the midst of an extraordinary run, spanning 12 months. Step forward Danny Willett, who seized an opportunity in the most emphatic way.
Then 28, Willett had enjoyed a decent professional career without scaling great heights. The Yorkshireman had played in the Masters only once before, when he tied in 38th place out of 97. But as Spieth stumbled, it was Willett who breezed to the summit of the leaderboard, with a closing round of 67 that took the title by the relatively comfortable margin of three shots.
Just 12 days earlier, Willett’s wife had given birth to the couple’s first child, Zach. “I always said I wouldn’t come here if Zach wasn’t born by now,” Willett said. “Fortunately, he listened to my prayers and came early. It’s just been the most ridiculously awesome 12 days.” Ewan Murray
New rule: from 2017 onwards, no referendums. Because it always ends in misery. Brexit proved that, but the ballad of Boaty McBoatface proved it harder. The Natural Environment Research Council was about to unveil a new £200m polar research vessel, and asked the public to name it. The public – or at least the LOLsy, internet-dwelling slice of the population that Instagrams coffeeshop blackboards – decided to name it Boaty McBoatface. In the end, Boaty McBoatface gained 124,000 votes, four times as many as its nearest rival, and the vessel’s fate looked set.
But then it didn’t, because science minister Jo Johnson decided the whole thing was silly. He named it the RSS Sir David Attenborough, hoping that aligning the craft with our greatest national treasure would calm everyone down. When that didn’t work, he promised to name one of the ship’s remotely controlled submersibles Boaty McBoatface instead, but it was too little too late.
Still, this wasn’t the end. Boaty McBoatface is a folk hero now. He is Robin Hood. He is Wat Tyler. Whenever there’s an injustice in the world, we will point our ears towards the wind and hear the words “Boaty McBoatface”. Stuart Heritage
When the pope visited Lesbos in April, he returned with three families. At first they lived in a refuge run by the Sant’Egidio charity; now the three families have paperwork, a titolo di viaggio allowing free travel in Europe, and homes of their own. “It’s what I dreamed of,” says Nour Essa, 31, who lives with her husband Hasan and son Riad in a two-room flat in Rome’s city centre. Bringing up a two-year-old in shared quarters had been a strain, and made Nour feel she couldn’t parent as she chose. Today, Riad attends nursery and is starting to talk. “We speak only Arabic to him,” Nour says. “He replies to us only in Italian.” A new life comes more easily to children.
Are they happier now? “We are better, but we feel homeless,” Nour says. “Your studies, all your efforts, are thrown away because you must initiate a new life. You are like a child.” She studied microbiology for five years in Damascus and two years postgraduate in France; in Italy she must start again from the third year of an undergraduate degree. Hasan, a garden designer, must study architecture before he can practise in Italy; he attends university in Rome.
The second family, Suhila Ayiad and Ramy Alshakarji, live alongside a community of nuns. Suhila is learning Italian; their 16-year-old son thrives and wants to study dentistry, while their 18-year-old is “living the teenage years he couldn’t live in Syria”, a Sant’Egidio spokesperson says diplomatically. Little Quds, Ramy and Suhila’s youngest, is at school.
The third family, Osama Qawqaji and Wafa Eid, live a long way south of the charity’s language school. If they integrate, it will be through their children, the spokesperson says. “Probably they are planning to go back to Syria when they can.” Paula Cocozza
To the terrible date of 15 April 1989, when 96 people died and hundreds more were injured and traumatised at an FA Cup semi-final, the bereaved Hillsborough families finally succeeded in adding 26 April 2016 as a historic landmark: the day the truth about the disaster was finally, legally established. Fully 27 years from the day their loved ones died, they crowded into the converted courtroom on a Warrington business park, all that suffering compressed into an awful wait for a jury to answer yes, or no, to 14 questions.
Questions six and seven were the heart of the matter, deciders in the families’ and survivors’ implacable struggle against the lies of South Yorkshire police, whose officers had organised a campaign to blame the victims, even as people were dying at the football ground. In 1991, South Yorkshire police made that case relentlessly at the first inquest, claiming the people who had paid to attend the event in an expectation of safety had drunk too much and somehow been recklessly too eager to watch the match. The families had to pay for their own legal representation; they could collectively afford £142,000 for a single barrister, pitted against the battery of publicly funded police lawyers, and the jury verdict was accidental death. This time, Theresa May’s Home Office provided funding for two rows of forensic and persistently combative lawyers to oppose the same allegations made again by the police.
This adversarial rerun of the old, already discredited police stories stretched the new inquests to two years, the longest case ever heard by a jury in British history. It had been agony for the families, forced to revisit every detail of the day their lives were devastated.
Finally, verdict day arrived. The forewoman of the jury answered questions one to five as expected, agreeing that there were appalling safety deficiencies in Sheffield Wednesday’s squalid Leppings Lane away end. Then came question six: were the 96 people unlawfully killed due to criminal gross negligence by the police officer in charge, Ch Supt David Duckenfield? “Yes,” the forewoman agreed, calmly, and the families’ years of struggle came to be vindicated. Next, question seven, key to whether this day would deliver justice or be another terrible chapter: did the behaviour of Liverpool supporters contribute to the dangerous situation? “No,” the forewoman said, with a kind note in her voice. The reaction was a gleeful outpouring of relief. People cheered, wept, hugged each other. For so many bleak years, this had been unthinkable, and now it really had come to pass: the lies had been overhauled by the truth.Outside, blinking, disbelieving, with film crews and photographers in front of them, a group of family members instinctively started to sing the Liverpool club anthem, You’ll Never Walk Alone. Ian Burke was 17 when his father, Henry, a builder, was among the 96 who died so needlessly, leaving bereft another son, daughter and a grief-stricken wife. Ian had taken time off work to sit through almost every day of the inquests; quiet, racked with stress. Just days before the verdicts, aged only 44, he had a heart attack.He is still suffering heart-related health problems, yet look at the film or photographs of the group outside the court on 26 April 2016, and there he is in the middle, with his suit and tie on, arm aloft, singing the beloved song, and smiling.

You wouldn’t have dared suggest it as a Hollywood script: too unlikely. The unfashionable football, a toe-poke from relegation the previous season, 5,000-1 outsiders to win it this time round, goes on to beat the moneyed glory boys to the Premier League title. Impossible. You’d have got better odds on Piers Morgan being named Arsenal manager (2,500-1, since you asked). Yet it did happen. Leicester City’s the name, romance is the game.
And not just any old romance. Romance in the most cynical, spendthrift league in the world, where Manchester City regularly spend £40m on defenders who can’t defend, Manchester United sell Paul Pogba for nothing (and later resign him for £89m without a blink), and Chelsea sack two managers a week for fun. And here was little Leicester City, a raggle-taggle army of rejects, has-beens and unknowns, managed by an elderly Italian nicknamed the Tinkerman because he was so indecisive, winning the league title.
They didn’t even inch their way to the premiership, they blew their rivals away, winning 23 games, losing only three and finishing 10 points clear of their closest rivals, Arsenal. Jamie Vardy, who had been playing non-league football for Fleetwood Town three years earlier, scored 24 goals and won a place in the England team; little known Riyad Mahrez won player of the year; thirtysomething has-been Robert Huth (long since rejected by Chelsea) forged a mighty partnership with thirtysomething never-been Wes Morgan (who had spent 10 years at Nottingham Forest and ran tattoo parlours on the side).
To say Leicester were penniless is untrue; all Premier League teams have money. But to put it in context, their squad cost £52.8m, just over one 10th of Manchester City’s.
After Christmas 2015, the impossible became ever more probable. By March, it was a likelihood, by April an inevitability, and on 2 May they were crowned champions. The city was painted blue: foreign film crews embedded themselves in the East Midlands and taught themselves how to pronounce Leicester; literary bigwigs such as Julian Barnes waxed poetic about their favourite club; and Gary Lineker promised to present Match Of The Day in his smalls (he did).
Order has been restored since those heady days. As I write, Leicester (with virtually the same team) are 14th in the league, four points off the relegation zone, with three wins and seven defeats. But it was wonderful while it lasted. Simon Hattenstone
“This is our Obama moment,” said Aisha from Tooting the day after the capital elected Sadiq Khan as mayor. For many other Londoners, it was the triumph of hope over fear, following an ugly campaign waged by Khan’s chief rival, Zac Goldsmith.
In a year characterised by the electoral gains of people and parties associated with the right, racism, xenophobia and nationalism, Khan’s decisive victory in May was a sweet, bright moment for those on the flipside of an increasingly binary political landscape. The contest was principally between Khan, the Muslim son of a bus driver and seamstress who grew up on a council estate with seven siblings, and Goldsmith, the son of a billionaire businessman and Eton alumnus.
On the advice of Conservative strategists, Goldsmith sought to portray Khan as a friend of Islamic extremists. The Tory candidate said Khan had “given platforms and oxygen and cover and excuses” to extremists. “London would be safer if I’m mayor,” he told voters.
Khan, meanwhile, celebrated the capital’s diversity. “I am a Londoner, I am European, I am British, I am English, I am of Islamic faith, of Asian origin, of Pakistani heritage, a dad, a husband,” he told voters, adding: “We do not just tolerate each other in London; we respect each other.”
When the votes were counted, Khan had the support of 57% of Londoners, compared with 43% who voted for Goldsmith. With around 1.3m votes, Khan also had the biggest personal mandate of any politician in UK history. Harriet Sherwood
At 10pm on a Sunday in May, Jacob Husley was setting up at London nightclub Fabric for his weekly house and techno night WetYourSelf! when he passed an elderly couple on the stairs: “They were walking down slowly and she was on crutches. I asked, ‘Are you OK?’ but they just smiled and kept going.” Husley, 36, who has DJed at Fabric for eight years, checked with security, who said the couple had turned up with tickets.
Husley went back in to find them at the bar. They were Polish and didn’t speak English. “I wanted to offer them a drink,” he says. “They had tequila shots and I thought, ‘This couple are wicked!’ But I still had a feeling there was a mistake.”
As the club filled up, Husley took them to the VIP lounge and when a Polish friend arrived, he had him translate. “They said they’d always dreamed of going to one of the big, great nightclubs in London.” They’d bought tickets online in Poland and were staying with their niece in London. Husley offered them another drink and when they asked for tea, fetched some from a cafe down the street.
Other guests embraced the first-time visitors. “They didn’t stay in the VIP area. He kept venturing out to the dancefloor and everyone was giving him lots of attention. She sat by the bar and couldn’t dance, but people were saying hello. They definitely enjoyed themselves.” At 5am, they took Husley up on his offer of a taxi home.
The next day, Husley put a photo of the couple on Facebook. It went viral. “I think it inspired people,” he says. “They posted to their friends, ‘This is us when we’re old.’” The story got international coverage, but Husley didn’t know the couple’s names and had no way of contacting them.
Then, a few weeks later, he received a letter from pensioners Wladyslaw Nykiel, 82, and Stanislawa Zapasnik, 79. Nykiel wrote: “We had a wonderful time dancing with young Londoners who welcomed us very warmly. There are no words to describe the atmosphere and great fun [of Fabric].”
When Islington council closed Fabric in September, Husley got back in touch. Nykiel sent a picture of him and Zapasnik holding a #savefabric placard. Fabric will now reopen on 6 January – and Husley has made sure the couple have tickets. Candice Pires
Two years ago, most of England was asleep, something that hit me every time I travelled there from Scotland. In the summer of 2014, people north of the border were in the midst of their referendum, and life was full of talk about what was at stake. I’d immerse myself in the hurly-burly, then fly home to a country that felt sedated, where politicians still spoke in lukewarm platitudes.
Now look. In the wake of the EU referendum, politics in England and Wales is crackling with life. I travel around the country for the Guardian, and getting people to talk used to be like pulling teeth. Now, I mention the EU, Theresa May or Trump and off the conversation goes: people are awake.
This is not all on the pro-Brexit side, by any means. Remainers are starting to find their voices, too. New cross-party “progressive” groups have sprung up in Brighton, London and East Anglia, set on opposing the vision shared by the Tories and Ukip. In November, the Green party had the sense to stand down in the Richmond Park byelection, with the aim of kicking out the pro-Brexit Tory “independent” Zac Goldsmith, thereby playing its part in his defeat.
A new group, More United, is raising money for candidates from “the progressive centre”, pledged to a pro-European, egalitarian future. Meanwhile, the pressure group Compass, which began inside the Labour party, then reached beyond it, is to start making the case against old-fashioned party divides and in favour of what it calls progressive alliances. As well as the Greens’ co-leader Caroline Lucas, a handful of the most forward-thinking Labour MPs are giving it quiet support.
If the next few years are going to see a big thrashing out of what England is, the process will not be the preserve of the right. Old politics (the endless talk of “hard-working families”, “going forward” and the rest) is pretty much finished. That’s a good thing. And if what has replaced it is proving visceral and primary-coloured, there are voices on the left who can meet that challenge. Of course it will be difficult; the word “struggle” is part of the progressive vocabulary for a reason. But isn’t it better to be awake than complacently snoozing? John Harris
On 15 January, Peake performed the first British spacewalk outside the International Space Station, an event that took a dramatic turn when his colleague Tim Kopra’s helmet began to fill with water. Peake had to take the lead and bring the other astronaut back to safety from the outer panels of the space station. He did this with the calmness they seem to breed in the bones of astronauts; they appear to be chosen these days not just for their ability to perform in ludicrously demanding environments, but to smile and enthusiastically explain things to awestruck children while doing it.
For six months, until he came back down to Earth in June, Peake did just that, his heavily scheduled days split between experiments and outreach. He sent videos to schools; ran a London Marathon in orbit; he got people in Britain excited.
And that, in the end, was the point. Peake was not the first British astronaut in space; that honour belongs to Helen Sharman, who spent a week on the Mir space station in 1991, and there have been five Britons on space shuttle missions (though they had to take US citizenship). But Peake was the first astronaut whose trip was directly funded by the British government, through the European Space Agency. Where our financial commitment to a pan-European body lies now, post-Brexit, remains to be seen. But for a few months there was a man from Chichester in space, and you just ask a nearby eight-year-old how cool that is. Dara Ó Briain
As the world contemplates the calamitous prospect of Donald Trump unravelling the landmark Paris climate agreement, we should take comfort in the fact that another international accord has begun remedying one of our biggest environmental messes.
Scientists reported this year that the ozone hole above Antarctica, ripped open by our use of a group of chemical compounds, has started healing – good news that is the fruit of the 1987 Montreal Protocol. This was when countries agreed the deal to first freeze and later phase out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), mostly in aerosols and refrigeration. Because the ozone layer protects us from ultraviolet light, the UN estimates the CFC phase-out has avoided 2m annual cases of skin cancer.
The hole has not vanished: it still opens from September to November, only more slowly. Experts believe there is still a way to go. But “by 2060 you’ll have almost no years with an ozone hole”, said Susan Solomon, who led the study published in Science magazine. “Maybe one in every 15 years, but it won’t be every year – bang, bang, bang – like it has been since the mid-80s.”
For Solomon, the healing of the hole is proof that the world can come together to tackle big environmental problems. “We made a mistake, and countries were willing to put their shoulders to the wheel and figure out how to fix it, and we did.”
The Montreal Protocol did have unintended consequences: the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) that largely replaced CFCs contribute to climate change, too. In October, 170 countries met in Uganda and reached a deal to fix that. Under the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol, HFCs will also ultimately be phased out, which some estimates say could avoid up to 0.5C of global warming. US secretary of state John Kerry hailed the deal as “a monumental step forward”. Adam Vaughan

Barbara Millicent Roberts has a distinctive look. The doll, better known as Barbie, was in 1959 either blond or brunette, before ditching her dark locks for a long, impossibly sleek golden mane. But even in the early days, Barbie was notable for her lithe limbs, large-yet-pert breasts and, of course, teeny-tiny waist.
Facially, her evolution has been almost constant: 1969’s eyeliner flicks and pixie nose meant Barbie looked like Bewitched’s Samantha. By the late 70s, she was bearing bright white teeth and in the late 80s/early 90s her already big pupils almost doubled in size; who knows why.
Figure-wise, however, little has changed. In 1998, Mattel gave its latest doll, Really Rad Barbie, slimmer hips, a wider waistline and smaller bust, so Barbie would “have more of a teenage physique”. And in 2000 she acquired a tummy button. Progress, it’s fair to say, has been slow.
But there is hope: in 2016, Mattel acknowledged its “responsibility to girls and parents to reflect a broader view of beauty” and gave Barbie a full-on reinvention. Jawlines were softened, thighs thickened, skin tones lightened and darkened. The Fashionistas range included three new body shapes (tall, curvy, petite), seven skin tones, 22 eye colours, 24 hairstyles and 14 “face sculpts”.
It’s easy to be cynical – diversity is good for business – and it may be some time before children choose to play with anything other than the white, blond, skinny doll that has epitomised western beauty ideals for so long. But when they do, at least there’s a taller-than-average, possibly mixed-race Barbie with a supercool undercut just waiting to steal the show. Leah Harper
In a year that saw America pass on the chance to elect its first female president, there was better news from Taiwan: Tsai Ing-wen rose to power as one of the rare self-made female Asian leaders to have succeeded through hard work rather than family connections. In January, she was elected Taiwan’s first female president, becoming the most powerful woman in the Chinese-speaking world.
Her Democratic Progressive party’s landslide win was boosted by young voters disillusioned with stagnant economic growth and rising inequality, and desperate to assert their country’s identity. Taiwan, an island of 23 million people about 100 miles off the Chinese coast, has its own government, currency and military, but is viewed by China as a renegade province. Most nations, wary of offending China, refuse to have formal diplomatic ties with it. However, US president-elect Donald Trump spoke with Tsai on the telephone in December, breaking decades of US foreign policy protocol.
Tsai, a law professor and LSE graduate, came to power on the back of the Sunflower Movement of 2014, when students occupied government buildings and thousands took to the streets to protest at a trade deal with Beijing.
It has, however, seen China retaliate by freezing diplomatic ties and allegedly restricting tourism to squeeze Taiwan’s struggling economy. And as Tsai has walked the tricky line between public expectations on independence and increased jobs and prosperity, her approval rating has plummeted. But the president, who has been called the “Angela Merkel of the east” for her calm, academic style, appears unfazed. “We want to make Taiwan an Asian tiger once again,” she wrote in the Economist in November. “My plan for 2017 is for Taiwan to renew its role as a pioneer.” Nicola Smith
The first week of 2016 seems like an entirely different place. For proof, look at #DrummondPuddleWatch: a livestream of a large puddle in Newcastle. If this happened now, we would treat it differently. We’d gnash our teeth about failing infrastructures, joylessly share overcooked thinkpieces about how the puddle was Brexit’s fault, brace ourselves for the inevitable moment when president-elect Trump would call the puddle “sad” on Twitter.
But back in the glory days of early January, #DrummondPuddleWatch was a treat: a dog in the playground, the first glimpse of snow. There was real pleasure to be taken from the various ways people attempted to traverse the puddle: on tiptoe, via an island-hopping technique using a nearby lamp-post, or smashing through regardless. It was the most basic personality test, dividing people into varying layers of caution; at once breathtakingly mundane and staggeringly life-affirming. It felt spectacularly British then, and it feels spectacularly innocent now.
At its peak, around 20,000 people were watching the puddle online. Before long, people brought lilos and surfboards with them. A crowd formed. Around a puddle. It felt like a moment in time, shared by all. One day, we’ll sit our grandchildren down and tell them about the time 20,000 people watched an old lady leapfrog a puddle, and they won’t believe us. “What’s a puddle?” they’ll ask through a gas mask in the concrete bunker they’ve never left, and we’ll be lost for words.

When Virginia McLaurin, aged 106, attended a White House reception in February, she wasn’t sure if she would meet President Obama. “We were waiting and I kept asking, ‘Where is he? Am I going to see him?’” she says, speaking from her home in Washington DC earlier this month, apologising for being hard of hearing.
McLaurin, born in 1909, grew up on a sharecropping farm in South Carolina. She was used to one entrance for white people at the front of a house and another at the back for black people. “I didn’t think I’d ever live to see a black president,” she says. “And I really didn’t think a poor person like me would get a chance to go to the White House.”
McLaurin, known locally as Ms V, is an active community member: she still volunteers up to 40 hours a week at a special needs school and Sundays are for church. When she said she wanted to meet the Obamas, a neighbour contacted White House staff and she was invited to a Black History Month event.
“When I got close to him, I was so excited, I just grabbed him,” she says. Video footage shows McLaurin, in a matching blue jacket and skirt, throwing her arms open, shouting, “Hi!” and clasping hands with Obama. “I grabbed her, too,” she says of the first lady.
In the video, the president jokes that McLaurin should slow down; Michelle Obama says, “I want to be like you when I grow up.” When McLaurin replies, “You can” and wiggles her shoulders with excitement, the three are led in some dance steps by Michelle.
As they gather for a photograph, the first lady exclaims, “Look at those nails!” McLaurin recalls they were the same blue as her suit and that her “fiftysomething” granddaughter had painted them. “You’ll notice I had on boots. That was because I didn’t have any shoes. But I thought, ‘I don’t care, I’m going anyhow.’”
When the video went viral, people heard of McLaurin’s volunteering and poor living conditions, and she received donations to a Facebook page set up by her neighbour. She was able to move into a more comfortable apartment in April, a few weeks after turning 107. “Everywhere I go, people hug and kiss me and want my picture,” she says. “All my joy came out when I met the president. It meant so much to me.” Candice Pires
Paul Trueman has been a fan of The Archers for more than a decade, but at the start of this year, like millions of other devotees of the long-running Radio 4 soap, he found himself seized by one particular storyline.
Helen Titchener, born a member of the titular farming family, now married to a manipulative bully named Rob, was being dragged ever more under his abusive control. Friends started spotting bruises. Now she was pregnant, and increasingly fearful for her young son.
Among the soap’s devoted fans on Twitter, Trueman noted, “There was a lot of, ‘Why can’t we do something? This is awful.’ Then an idea popped into my head. If she were real, we could fundraise to get her out of there. So I thought, that’s what we should do. We should start a fundraising page for a fictional character” – with the profits going to help real-life victims of domestic violence.
Within a couple of hours, Trueman had set up a page on the JustGiving website in aid of the charity Refuge, with a nominal target of £1,000. “I thought if we were lucky we might reach that in a month.”
That was around 9pm. His phone pinged five minutes later, the first alert that someone had donated money. By midnight, he had passed his target. “And my phone didn’t stop pinging for the next six months. It was bonkers.” He didn’t turn off the notifications, “partly because I loved getting them. It was just fantastic, a little bit of a drug.”
Within 48 hours, the total passed £20,000; it was £45,000 by the end of the first week. Most powerful, for Trueman, were the comments from those donating, many anonymous.
“To the charity that saved me and my children, eternal thanks.”
“I was a Helen. I came out the other side. There’s a light there at the end of the tunnel.”
Ten months after Trueman’s bright idea – and aided, he stresses, by many, many others – the site has raised more than £200,000 (including gift aid) for Refuge. It’s still open for donations. “Never before in my 33-year career at Refuge have I seen such public support for our work,” says Sandra Horley, the charity’s chief executive. “It has been incredible to see this storyline, and one Archers fan from Devon, inspire so many members of the public to engage with something that goes on behind closed doors.”
“2016 has sucked, don’t get me wrong,” Trueman says. “But I am quietly proud of the fact that, as a community, Archers listeners have been responsible for one of the bright sparks of the year.” Esther Addley
It’s long been the case that women pay more than men for virtually identical products such as plastic razors and face creams (typically branded pink for ladies, black or blue for men).
In February, Boots bowed to consumer pressure over “sexist pricing” of products by changing the cost of its razors and eye creams. The high street giant made the pledge after a change.org petition set up by campaigner Stevie Wise highlighted the disparity between equivalent products marketed at men and women. Since then, Boots has brought its No7 skincare range into line, ensuring products are sold for the same price across male and female ranges.
Superdrug has also reviewed the pricing disparity and cut prices of its own-brand razors, adding that it is challenging suppliers that charge more for women’s products. Argos, which came under fire after selling pink scooters for £5 more than the same blue ones, claimed the discrepancy was an error that had been corrected. However, in September, the gender equality group Fawcett found in an analysis of supermarket own-brand toiletries (at Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons) that women are paying on average 31% more than men for a basket of comparable toiletries. Fawcett intends to keep up the pressure. Rebecca Smithers
The Office for National Statistics published official figures that confirmed a staggering 51% drop in the rate of pregnancy among under-18s in less than two decades. It is now at its lowest level since records began in the late 1960s: in 1998, in England and Wales, 47 out of every 1,000 young women under 18 became pregnant; by 2014 (the figures published this year), that had plummeted to 23 out of every 1,000. The World Health Organisation is exploring how this turnaround was achieved and whether it can be replicated elsewhere.
The key engine driving such dramatic change was an ambitious policy known as the teenage pregnancy strategy, launched by the Labour government in 1999. It was a 10-year project, almost unheard of in quick-fix government circles, with work carried out in schools and colleges, among youth and social workers.
Teenage conception rates have also dropped worldwide, for similar reasons, including more widely available, high-quality sex education, and greater access to more effective contraception. Another theory is the advent of social media - youngsters are busy networking at home via Facebook and Instagram rather than meeting face-to-face over a six-pack of lager. Sally Weale
With spring came the story of Atlas, the giant bunny who was given a new home following a nationwide charity appeal by the Scottish SPCA. Atlas was a then seven-month-old continental giant rabbit, and about the size of a west highland terrier (too large for his previous owner). His new owner, Jen Hislop, 43, from North Ayrshire, was chosen from hundreds of applicants around the world who hoped to adopt the rabbit.
“I burst into tears when I got the phone call saying I had been chosen to rehome Atlas,” said Hislop, who renamed him Attila The Bun Binky Master Jazz Paws – Atty, for short – and who was provided with a buggy to help get him around.
The continental giant is one of the largest and oldest breeds of rabbits, and can grow to 1.2m long, weigh more than 20kg, and eat a bale of hay a week as well as up to 2,000 carrots and 700 apples a year. Nadia Khomami

Even people who love new recipe ideas hit saturation point at some time in the year. And that’s usually about now. We spend the weeks leading up to Christmas entertaining all the different possibilities being shared left, right and centre, and then, right at the last minute, remember that the traditional festive meal is nothing more than a big roast dinner with all sorts of tasty trimmings. That’s when we realise that Christmas will still happen even if we don’t transform into an entirely different cook from the one we are the rest of the year.
When you put on your apron to get ready for tomorrow’s main event, don’t forget that everyone prefers a regular meal and a chilled-out host to some elaborate feast and a stressed-out cook. If you cook what you love to eat and eat what you love to cook, your day will be a happy one. It’s this way of thinking that informs so much of what I cook, eat and share with family and friends all year round. It’s also why I’m as likely to be slurping on a bowl of noodles on Boxing Day as tucking into yet another turkey sandwich or chunk of stilton. Today’s recipes are all about the ingredients I’ll be craving over the next week.
I’ll happily eat this at any time of day, and especially for a late weekend breakfast. You can get green tea soba noodles from large supermarkets and Asian food stores; regular soba noodles, which are even more widely available, are a good alternative.
For the perfect boiled egg, with a firm white and runny yolk, bring a medium pot of water to a boil on a high heat. Carefully lower in four room-temperature eggs (if your eggs are fridge-cold, they’ll take longer to cook) and leave to bubble away for six minutes. Lift out the eggs and transfer to a bowl in the sink and leave under cold running water for a minute or two, to halt the cooking process. Just before serving, peel off the shell and cut or tear the egg in half. Serves four.
200g green tea soba noodles (or regular soba)
30g basil leaves, picked and roughly chopped
30g coriander leaves, picked and roughly chopped
70g pistachio kernels, lightly toasted and roughly chopped
½ tsp ground cardamom
3 limes – finely grate one (to get ½ tsp zest), squeeze another (to get 3 tbsp juice) and cut the third into quarters
3 tbsp groundnut oil
1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed
1 green chilli, deseeded and finely chopped
Salt 
2 ripe avocados, cut into 0.5cm slices
4 eggs, soft-boiled (see introduction)
¼ tsp nigella seeds
Cook the noodles according to the instructions on the packet (cooking times vary from brand to brand), then refresh under cold water and transfer to a colander to drain.
Put the basil, coriander, pistachios, cardamom, lime zest, lime juice, oil, garlic, chilli and half a teaspoon of salt in a large bowl. Mix to combine, then add the noodles and divide between four bowls. Arrange the avocado slices on top of each serving, and top with two egg halves (peel and cut them just before serving). Finish with a sprinkle of nigella seeds, and serve each portion with a wedge of lime.
It’s easy to get stuck in our ways with apples. A granny smith is sweet and tart enough to work here, but why not try something new for a change? My local grocer, Parkway Greens in Camden, gets some of its apples from Brogdale in Kent, home of the National Fruit Collection, and I recently munched my way through eight varieties I’d never tried before. They were as delicious and different from each other as bottles in a mixed case of wine. Serves six to eight.
60ml cider vinegar
30g caster sugar
1 small red onion, peeled and finely sliced 
5cm piece ginger, peeled and julienned
150g flat rice noodles, broken into roughly 15cm pieces
3 tbsp olive oil
200g frozen edamame, quickly blanched, drained and dried
1 sweet, sharp apple, cored and cut into 2mm-thick wedges
2 large 400g cucumbers, cut in half lengthways, seeds scooped out and flesh cut into long, thin strips 
2 red chillies, deseeded and julienned
10g mint leaves, roughly shredded
10g tarragon leaves, roughly chopped
1 tbsp poppy seeds
Salt and black pepper
Put the vinegar, sugar and 60ml water in a small saucepan on a high heat. Bring to a boil, stir until the sugar has dissolved, then cook for two minutes, until the liquid has reduced by a third. Put the onion and ginger in a small bowl, pour over the hot liquid and set aside for an hour, until the vegetables have softened.
Put the noodles in a large bowl and pour over enough boiling water to cover. Set aside for 10-15 minutes, until the noodles are soft, then drain and put in a large bowl. Toss with a tablespoon of oil and leave to cool.
Add all the other ingredients to the noodles, including the pickled onion and ginger, and their pickling juices, and season with a teaspoon and a half of salt and plenty of black pepper. Toss and serve at once.
Lots of alternatives here, if you want: use regular basil if you can’t find Thai basil (although a lot of supermarkets do sell it) and if you can’t get hold of a green mango, use a regular mango instead. You don’t want it too ripe and sweet, though – green mangoes have a welcome tartness – and you might want to reduce the sugar in the dressing down to 20 grams. The black noodles look great against the salmon but, again, these can be replaced with whatever you can find: udon and soba both work well as substitutes. If you have a mandolin, then now is the time to use it for the vegetables. If you don’t, keep a lookout in the post-Christmas sales. Serves four.
3 tbsp rice vinegar
30g caster sugar
¼ tsp chilli flakes
1 tsp sesame oil
1 tbsp soy sauce
¾ tsp fish sauce
4 salmon fillets (about 130g each), skin on and boneless
For the salad
85g black rice noodles (or soba, udon, etc, if you can’t find black ones)
2 large carrots, peeled and julienned
4cm piece ginger, peeled and julienned
150g beansprouts
2 small shallots, peeled and finely sliced
1 green mango (or a not-too-ripe regular mango), peeled, stoned, and flesh cut into julienne strips 
10g Thai basil leaves
10g mint leaves
10g coriander leaves
2 tbsp toasted sesame seeds (white and black, ideally), plus 2 tsp extra, to serve
For the dressing
2 tbsp groundnut oil
3 tbsp lime juice, plus 1 lime, quartered, to serve
1 tbsp mirin
Salt
Put the vinegar and sugar in a small saucepan on a high heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves, then leave to boil for two minutes, until you’re left with a thick syrup. Take off the heat and stir in the chilli, half a teaspoon of sesame oil, and the soy and fish sauces. Put the salmon fillets in a bowl and pour this mixture all over them, then add an eighth of a teaspoon of salt, turn to coat the fish and leave to marinate for 10 minutes.
Mix all the dressing ingredients with the remaining half-teaspoon of sesame oil and a teaspoon of salt, and put to one side.
Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Half-fill a medium saucepan with water, bring to a boil, then cook the noodles for four to five minutes (or according to the instructions). Drain, refresh under cold water to stop the noodles cooking more, drain again and put in a large bowl with the other salad ingredients.
Put the salmon fillets skin side down in a small baking dish (about 20cm x 30cm), so they fit snugly, pour over the marinade and roast for 12 minutes, basting the fish twice, until caramelised and cooked, but still a little pink in the middle. Remove and keep warm.
Just before serving, pour the dressing over the salad and toss. Divide between four shallow bowls and top each serving with a warm salmon fillet, skin side down, and a drizzle of the cooking juices. Sprinkle with the remaining sesame seeds and serve with a lime wedge.

Finding the good news stories in a year in which the grim reaper more than overstayed his welcome in arts circles might seem like an unenviable task: 2016 did, after all, rob us of Victoria Wood, Leonard Cohen, Alan Rickman, Caroline Aherne, Ronnie Corbett, Harper Lee, Gene Wilder, Terry Wogan, Zaha Hadid, George Martin, and many more. There were also various puzzling new cultural dilemmas: how, for instance, could we appreciate a Solange Knowles album (A Seat At The Table) interspersed with her father’s recollections of the Ku Klux Klan, when a KKK-backed candidate was soon to be installed in the White House? Was it possible to enjoy a baby ibex prancing up and down a mountain, as we witnessed in Planet Earth II, without fretting over the forecasts of impending ecological doom?
But culture is never more vital than during times of turbulence, whether acting as a shoulder to cry on, a rallying voice of dissent, or simply a form of blissful escapism.
So while the Tories heaped misery on society’s poorest, artists spoke up: Ken Loach’s I, Daniel Blake became the surprise winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes, thanks to its revealing portrait of a man trapped in Britain’s Kafka-esque benefits system. Likewise the Brexit vote and its terrifying fallout informed Ali Smith’s swiftly written novel Autumn, which portrayed a country divided and opened with the cheery line: “It was the worst of times, it was the worst of times.” Tunbridge Wells punk duo Slaves surely cast a knowing glance at the Leave mantra with their Take Control album, and the short, snotty blasts of noise called Lies, or Rich Man, contained within. Brexit trod the boards, too: James Graham’s play A Strong Exit was written exclusively for the Guardian, while performance artist Scottee’s Putting Words In Your Mouth involved actors lip-synching to real interviews with LGBT people: just how tolerant would Brexit Britain be, it asked.
Fears over climate change produced thoughtful and moving responses: Nottingham artist Wolfgang Buttress created a meditative drone symphony using the collective buzz from 40,000 bees; he would later perform it live from within a giant metal beehive he erected in Kew Gardens. Elsewhere, statements in the art world were notable beyond the art itself: Helen Marten won the Turner prize and the Hepworth prize for sculpture this year, and announced she would be sharing the prize money for both with her fellow nominees. Human rights lawyer Philippe Sands and author of East West Street also displayed generosity of spirit, giving his £30,000 Baillie Gifford prize money to charity.
As identity politics became the new battleground for culture wars across the Atlantic, that, too, spawned bold artistic statements: Paul Beatty became the first US winner of the Man Booker prize with The Sellout, which managed to somehow find humour in the notion of reinstating slavery, and got the acclaim it deserved after battling multiple rejection letters. Barry Jenkins’ Moonlight, released in the US last year and out in the UK in February, shone a moving light on the joy and sadness within gay black lives. And Transparent, the hit HBO comedy, continued to clean up at the Emmys: its creator Jill Soloway used her winner’s speech to thank the trans community who inspired the show, before declaring: “Topple the patriarchy!”
In pop, movements such as Black Lives Matter were swept up into the US mainstream: Beyoncé’s chart-topping Lemonade was unafraid to sample Malcolm X, or feature the mothers of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown in her visual album concept. She was just one of several major black pop artists in the midst of a creative renaissance, each one pushing the boundaries of genre and ripping up expectations: Kanye West, Rihanna, Blood Orange and Frank Ocean all made dazzling musical statements, the latter’s stunning Blonde a fuzzy meditation on youth, drugs and relationships that eschewed explicit slogans yet seemed political just in its existence.
Elsewhere, British TV thrived thanks to serious drama such as War And Peace, The Crown, The Night Manager and National Treasure, which dared to examine the sexual abuse scandals that rocked the nation in the wake of Savile. Even if 2016 didn’t feel like a year in which there was much to joke about, there was plenty to make you laugh: UK comedy found humour in the bleakness of the everyday, with sadcoms such as Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag, or stresscoms such as Motherland, which starred Anna Maxwell Martin as a not-quite-coping mum drinking Jacob’s Creek for breakfast.
So there was plenty of good news, even if much of it was good news arising from bad news. You only needed to look at this year’s Glastonbury to see how the two could interact: on paper, a bill featuring headline slots for Coldplay and Adele was not one to get the pulse racing. Yet staged in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, both sets felt oddly fitting: Adele’s nervous, chatterbox routine mirrored many people’s own anxieties, and was as reassuring as a daft pub chat with your best mate. Nor was 2016 the year cynically to bemoan Chris Martin et al’s comfort-blanket tendencies: how could you, when a comfort blanket was what people were crying out for?

It came from beyond the Large Magellanic Cloud. The signal, a mere 20 milliseconds long, captured the moment when two black holes slammed together – a cataclysm that sent ripples through spacetime and onwards to Earth, where they made instruments chirp and scientists cheer. “We have detected gravitational waves,” said David Reitze of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo). “We did it.”
The announcement ranked as the physics discovery of the year, confirming Einstein’s century-old theory of gravity and putting the Ligo team on course for a Nobel. But the real excitement is yet to come. For the first quarter of a million years, the cosmos was hidden from astronomers. Now scientists can build gravitational wave observatories and, with them, look back to the birth of the universe. We can study the moment of creation.
It wasn’t the only time astronomers celebrated in 2016. In August, the European Southern Observatory in the Chilean desert saw changes in the light coming from Proxima Centauri, the star nearest to the sun. An Earth-sized planet was pulling the red dwarf around. What thrilled astronomers was that the newly discovered world lay in the star’s habitable zone, that Goldilocks region of space where the temperature is right for liquid water, and along with water, perhaps life. The discovery brought the question, “Are we alone?” to our cosmic doorstep – and with it the realisation that such planets are not rare.
Stephen Hawking is convinced that aliens are out there, but he’s wary of inviting them over. In his 2016 film, Stephen Hawking’s Favourite Places, he warned that meeting up with a technologically advanced bunch of cosmic hooligans might do for humanity what Christopher Columbus did for the Native Americans.
Hawking is equally suspicious of artificial intelligence. Yes, superintelligent machines might solve our greatest challenges, but not if they wipe us out instead. Fortunately, that threat remains a distant one.
For some people, merging with robots makes sense. Nathan Copeland, a 28-year-old who broke his neck in a car crash, had a robot arm wired directly into his brain. He could move it by thinking, and through signals passed back to his brain, experience a sense of touch. By providing sensory feedback, researchers are edging towards their ultimate goal: robotic limbs that move and feel like real ones.
More than 25 US states have now legalised marijuana for medical uses, but could magic mushrooms be next? A handful of small studies found that psilocybin (the ingredient that made for happy hippies in the 1970s) could lift severe depression in one group of volunteers, and reduce anxiety and depression in cancer patients. For Stephen Ross, director of addiction psychiatry at NYU Langone Medical Center, the latter results were unprecedented. “We don’t have anything like it,” he said.
“More work needed” was the take home from another trial in 2016; this time for a male contraceptive. At last it seemed that men could shoulder the responsibility for birth control, and all it required was, well, a little prick. The bimonthly hormone jab was nearly as effective as the female pill, but the trial was halted after 20 men dropped out. Some suffered from depression and acne; others had to contend with soaring libidos.
Of the 130 million or so babies born this year, one that arrived in April marked a scientific first. A Jordanian boy was created with DNA from three people (his parents, plus a healthy donor) to prevent him from inheriting a serious genetic disease. The US team who performed the treatment in Mexico say the boy is healthy, but such diseases can take hold later in life. In December, the fertility regulator in the UK gave clinics the green light to apply for a licence to offer the procedure, known as mitochondrial replacement therapy, paving the way for similar births in Britain.
Every year has its own advances, but all tell the story of science. Great ideas work or fail. Achievements are lauded, but make us think twice. With each, we understand that little bit more about ourselves and the universe. And if none of it makes much sense yet? Well, we can always ask the aliens.

In the moments after beating Milos Raonic in straight sets to win the Wimbledon singles title for the second time in July, Andy Murray glanced up at the royal box and saw David Cameron beaming down. Murray, whose politics lean towards Scottish independence, observed for the benefit of Sue Barker, an enthralled Centre Court and those watching worldwide, “A huge thank you to everyone who came out to support me. The prime minister’s here, as well, I see. Playing in a Wimbledon final is tough, but I wouldn’t want to be prime minister. It’s an impossible job.”
Who knew then that within two months Cameron would have left politics completely and Murray would be adding a second Olympic title to his second Wimbledon championship? He then capped the most impressive season of his 11-year career by beating his long-time bete noir, Novak Djokovic, to win the ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena in Greenwich last month, sealing his position as the world’s number one. At 29, he was the oldest player to do so since John Newcombe in 1974.
In 2016, Murray not only established his status as Britain’s most outstanding athlete, but he finally won a permanent place in the affections of an audience that was once reluctant to embrace the sometimes angry Scot. Just about everything went his way this year, both on and off the court. He and his wife, Kim, celebrated the arrival of their first child, Sophia, in February; and once he found a rhythm with the racket after an uncertain start to the season, including defeat by Djokovic in the French Open final, Murray returned from Rio to win five tournaments and 25 matches in a row.
He is back with coach Ivan Lendl, after the surprise departure of Amélie Mauresmo earlier in the summer, and finished the season free of the injuries that have plagued him in previous years. There are strong rumours of a knighthood in the New Year’s honours list.
However ill-equipped Murray might be to run the country, Cameron would gladly have traded places with him that July Sunday, and certainly thereafter. Murray might not have been so keen. Kevin Mitchell
Where to start with Michelle’s Carpool Karaoke? Well, first of all, imagine any British PM or PM’s spouse doing this. So in your car with James Corden you’ve got, say, Theresa May or that fella in the specs she’s married to, Call Me Dave Cameron or Sam Cam, Gordon Brown or Sarah, Tony or Cherie, Maggie or Denis? Imagine just what teeth-clenchingly, bottom-wrigglingly uncomfortable viewing that would make.
But this was positively joyous. Michelle is funny, smart, gorgeous, caring and cool. She is the antidote to everything we despise about the political class. And what makes it even better is that she did it in a year when we’ve never despised them more.
All credit to Corden, who has created a wonderful slot on his Late Late Show. But there was only one star this time: this is all about Michelle. While most politicians would look lost, weird, desperate, unhinged (possibly all four), Michelle is just having a great time, singing her heart out, car-seat boogie-ing while enjoying a jaunt around the White House lawns. It’s impossible not to love her.
There are so many highlights, from Michelle’s first words (“Hey there, you wanna go for a spin?”), to giving up their secret service codenames (hers is Renaissance, Barack’s is Renegade), to Missy Elliott’s surprise pop-up appearance in the back seat. And then there’s the music: Stevie Wonder’s Signed, Sealed, Delivered I’m Yours, Beyoncé’s Single Ladies and Missy’s Get Ur Freak On. Michelle knows all the words and every move.
At the same time, she manages to promote her scheme to get every girl in the world educated, drops in the astonishing fact that 66 million girls are not in school, and gets properly political: “So much could be corrected in the world if girls were educated and had power over their lives.”
This is already a reminder of everything we will miss over the next four years. (And no, I won’t ruin it all by saying his name.) Perhaps Barack wasn’t the transformational politician many had hoped for, but as a family there has not been a finer role model than the Obamas in the White House. Gracious, dignified, warm and, most important of all, human. Never has a first family appeared so normal, or to enjoy life so much – and not at the expense of the others. If you’re still not convinced, just picture Philip May rapping along to Get Ur Freak On. Simon Hattenstone
This year, I was tasked with training Nottinghamshire police to recognise a new category of hate crime: misogyny. We added it to the existing list of disability, race, religion, homophobia, and transphobia. Our definition of it is “incidents against women that are motivated by an attitude of a man towards a woman, and includes behaviour targeted at a woman by men, simply because she is a woman”.
When the policy launched in July, most headlines disappointingly framed this definition around wolf whistling. But we were not inundated with reports of whistling; actual reports included pregnant women being assaulted, girls being harassed in their school uniforms, and one incident that was recategorised as abduction.
If something happens to a woman that makes her uncomfortable, and she feels that it happened because she is a woman, she can now call 101 anywhere in the UK and report it as a hate crime. The difference in Nottingham is that instead of that report going into the “hate crime: other” folder, such incidents are now recorded in their own category, just as “hate crime: disability” would be. Women in Nottingham are guaranteed a specially trained officer to deal with their case. Investigations are launched, and if perpetrators are found, they are warned and hopefully enlightened. In serious cases, public order offences can be given. Where warnings are either too late, or insufficient, this hate crime allows us better to track offender behaviour.
Nationally, 64% of all women have experienced sexual harassment in public places; that figure rises to 85% of women and girls under 25. By reporting, we can begin to identify hotspots, repeat offenders and women who are high risk for victimisation. It’s hoped that by taking these cases seriously, women will feel encouraged to disclose other gendered crimes.
In May, I began training every response officer, beat manager and police community support officer in Nottinghamshire, along with the control room. One focus was safety techniques women can use: avoiding certain areas, wearing silent shoes and carrying keys between their fingers. Female officers would often turn to each other, shocked to realise they did all these things unconsciously. Some officers were taken aback by the statistics and stories that were shared. I found it easy to sympathise. After all, if you’re a man who does not commit misogynistic hate crime yourself, it would be largely hidden from you. Perpetrators rarely harass women who are accompanied by men.
Violence against women needs to be understood as a continuum. We must challenge what’s taking place in the streets alongside our homes, campuses and the workplace. I hope this will become the national standard; the training is now available to all forces. I believe that we will look back in 20 years and wonder what took us so long. Martha Jephcott, campaigner
It is hard to imagine a more perfect antidote to the resurgence of misogyny, homophobia and racism in Brazil than the Olympic victory of Rafaela Silva. The gay black judoka from the City of God favela won the host nation’s first gold of the 2016 Games, lifting the spirits of a population mired in economic gloom and political crisis. The buzzer at the end of the final bout could hardly be heard above delirious cheering as Silva sank to her knees and raised her arms to the rafters. She then ran into the arms of her coach, sobbing with joy, as celebrations erupted across the country.
It was a triumph against adversity, and not just because Silva overcame world number one Sumiya Dorjsuren of Mongolia, who had beaten her on all four of their previous encounters. On her right bicep, Silva has a tattooed reminder of what she has been through: an image of the Olympic rings and the words “Only God knows what I suffered to get here”. She thought about quitting the sport after she was disqualified from the 2012 London Games (for an illegal hold), while furious critics back home posted hate-filled messages on Twitter and Facebook.
But the 24-year-old does not give up easily. Growing up in the City of God, Silva has seen friends and family members shot and arrested for drug dealing. The street games she played as a child were often interrupted by gunfights. At times, gangsters would forbid residents to leave because they were planning an ambush.
Silva credits her father with helping her find a way out: it was he who insisted she take up a sport. Initially she wanted to become a footballer, but boys dominated the community pitch and wouldn’t let her play. “So I had to do a sport I didn’t like – judo,” she tells me, grinning.
The day after the Olympics, Silva went on a victory parade through the favela on top of a fire engine. Her community was delirious. It was the best thing that had ever happened to the City of God, and she is all too aware of the significance: “I’m a black woman and I grew up in this community. I didn’t have big dreams, because there aren’t many opportunities. People here think they have nowhere to go beyond drugs and bullets. But I showed that you can achieve great things even if you don’t have much money.”
The timing was apposite. Shortly before the Olympics, the country’s first woman president, Dilma Rousseff of the Workers’ Party, was ousted in an impeachment plot and replaced by the more conservative Michel Temer, who appointed an all-male, all-white cabinet.
Silva, who is a sergeant in the army, is reluctant to talk politics; she is just glad she was able to inspire people at a time when hope was in short supply. “People come up to me and say thank you, that their children have taken up sport because of me, and that I helped give them a lift. It has been a difficult year for Brazil because of the politics, and violence in the community. Many people doubted we were capable of pulling off an Olympics. But we did it, and we got some medals as well.”
Victory has changed her life, too. She is thinking of getting another tattoo: “I’d like something to mark the victory, but I haven’t decided on the best way to do that.” More significantly, she has paid for an extension on her parents’ home, and bought new houses for her sister and herself. As she says: “That’s a big thing for a girl who grew up in a family who couldn’t afford even to buy a new bicycle.” Jonathan Watts
The fact that the shortlist on this year’s BBC Sports Personality of the Year is 16 as opposed to the more regular 10 is testament to the embarrassment of golden performances from Team GB at the Olympics and Paralympics in Rio this summer.
Olympic and Paralympic sport gets into our hearts, it brings us to tears, to the edge of our seats – and all for people we’ve never heard of before. Every four years, the shot at glory is there. Screw up, and your chance might never come again: you may not even get selected next time. Sure, there are world championships and other titles in the cycle, but it’s the Olympics every athlete wants.
Gymnast Max Whitlock is a man who didn’t just manage to peak at the right time within that cycle, but who peaked twice in 90 minutes, bringing home two gold medals for Great Britain in a sport in which there had previously been none. A history-maker, Whitlock will inspire the next generation of gymnasts to reach higher.
On a global level, the 2016 Olympics gave us moments to savour; we are blessed to be alive to watch Usain Bolt run, to have seen Michael Phelps swim and to watch Simone Biles tumble and twist. But it was a South African called Wayde van Niekerk who brought me to the edge of my seat. From lane nine, he ran a new world record on his way to Olympic gold in the 400m – and the man who held the record, Michael Johnson, was sitting by my side throughout. Talk about drama. Johnson’s reaction was as cool as you’d expect: “I have held that for 17 years. It’s time someone ran faster.”
Women’s sport still gets just 10% of all sports media coverage – except when the Paras and Olympics are on. The likes of the incredible gold-medal-winning women’s hockey team, Laura Trott (now Kenny), Jessica Ennis-Hill, Kadeena Cox and Dame Sarah Storey help to redress that imbalance and boost the column inches. If you are a young girl with sporting ambition and you don’t see these women, how do you know what’s possible? This year’s Games gave us a better idea.
Who would have thought, 12 months ago, that a female hockey player would make it to the last four of I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here? Great Britain’s hockey gold has given these women a platform and a voice, and Sam Quek used her elimination night interview very well: “Sport is fun, and that’s what I wanted to show young girls,” she told Ant and Dec. You did that, Sam.
Rio illustrated that we are truly in a golden age when it comes to the Olympics and Paralympics. There was a point at which we overtook China on the medal table, when I thought, “This is all a bit uncomfortably peculiar – such an unfamiliar feeling.” As a keen student of Olympic history (and a failed Olympian wannabe: I was a Commonwealth Games gymnast), I still remember the low of Atlanta 1996 well (one gold and 36th in the medal table). How far we have come. Gabby Logan
When he became the youngest person ever elected to Hong Kong’s legislature, Nathan Law felt the city’s hopes for democracy resting on his shoulders. Two years ago, the 23-year-old was a student leader during months of street protests that saw thousands occupy the former British colony’s financial centre.
“There’s a symbolic meaning to my seat, showing the spirit of the movement continues,” Law says in his new office above the harbour. “It gained a high moral ground and people want me to carry on the fight.” His election victory in September has helped motivate others to become more politically active: his staff are almost all refugees of the 2014 “umbrella movement” protests.
Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement has long fought an uphill battle, consistently outnumbered in the city’s parliament, where only half the seats are directly elected; the others are returned by professional associations and special interest groups. Law hopes the support he received will translate to more than just votes, and says it is critical to maintain pressure on a government responsible more to Beijing than to Hong Kong citizens.
“People shouldn’t just lay their expectations on me, then go home to play video games, back to their ordinary lives,” he says. “I have to convince people to walk with me on the frontline, and use my position to facilitate civil disobedience and resistance on the streets. Even though we’re up against China, the strongest tyranny in the world, we can at least support human rights and freedom.” Benjamin Haas
As the CofE continued to tie itself in knots over whether same-sex couples could wed in church, or gay priests could marry, the bishop of Grantham publicly declared he was in a long-term relationship with a man. Nicholas Chamberlain told the Guardian he hoped to be “judged by my actions as a parish priest, a bishop – and by the Lord, ultimately. My sexual identity is part of who I am, but it’s the ministry that matters.” He did not want to become known as “the gay bishop”, he added.
Justin Welby, archbishop of Canterbury and leader of the worldwide Anglican church, said he had known about Chamberlain’s relationship when he appointed him. To the fury of conservative Christians, Welby said, “His sexuality is completely irrelevant to his office.”
While Chamberlain says he has abided by the church’s requirement for priests in gay relationships to be celibate, Gafcon, a group of conservative Anglicans, said his appointment was a “major error”. But to campaigners for LGBT rights within the church, the first serving bishop to declare he was gay was a major fillip. Harriet Sherwood
At 7.30pm on 19 September, all was peaceful at Pikpa, a small refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos. Most of the volunteers had gone home, and founder Efi Latsoudi was winding down for the day. Then the phone rang: the island’s main camp was on fire and children needed to be evacuated immediately.
Within 10 minutes, 20 volunteers had returned and started preparing to rehouse 98 children. The camp already hosted 150 refugees, mostly families, so they had to improvise, quickly assembling huge tents and setting up beds in the communal kitchen. “The refugee children here were very excited and helped a lot,” Latsoudi says. “I was very proud.”
The new arrivals were terrified at first: “We told them there was nothing to fear – it’s an open camp and they were welcome. They soon relaxed.” Latsoudi laughs: “It was like a holiday for them.”
Pikpa is a former children’s holiday camp with wooden cabins, shady pine trees and play areas. Compared with the two major camps on the island, which routinely flood or catch fire, it’s paradise. The children stayed for three days before being taken back, and on the last night, the whole camp had a big dinner and dancing.
Latsoudi says those three days were among the happiest of her life. “Everybody was running around, working together – it was amazing. In all this mess, suddenly something worked out.” Helen Nianias

To begin a column by referencing The OC, a teen TV show that ended nine years ago, probably dates me only marginally less than the fact that the album I listened to most this year, Spotify tells me, was Pure R&B 90s. The cutting bleeding edge, that’s what you come here for, folks.
The OC, a show that is discussed these days with baffling infrequency, brought a lot of good into my life. First, it resolved the question of what happened to Jim Robinson from Neighbours (AKA the actor Alan Dale) after his too-early heart attack on the Ramsay Street kitchen floor, and the answer was, somewhat unexpectedly, he became a mean multimillionaire in California. Did anyone tell his mother-in-law, Helen Daniels, about this? Or was she too busy running her chauffeur service, Home James, to listen? But it also gave nomenclature to a rarely articulated and yet annual event in my life. Chrismukkah, undoubtedly The OC’s greatest (only) legacy.
Chrismukkah is the portmanteau coined by the show’s character Seth Cohen to refer to the celebration of both Christmas and Hanukah. But the show fudges the issue by saying Seth had to do this because his father is Jewish and his mother a Wasp. The truth is, a lot of Jews – in fact, nearly every Jew I know – does it just because they want to. Hey, we might say our prayers in Hebrew instead of Latin but we want to eat chocolate Santas for 10 days straight, too, OK?
Another TV show nodded to this. In Seinfeld, George Costanza’s father creates Festivus, “A festivus for the rest of us!” For Festivus, the Costanzas have an undecorated aluminium pole instead of a Christmas tree; but a lot of Jews love the actual Christmas paraphernalia, trees and all, because, dammit, it’s so pretty and cheering and a lot of it is really, really tasty (not the tree). Given how guilty we feel anyway, this is not an easy thing to admit.
I have always lived a Chrismukkah life. I am fully Jewish – nothing ish about it – and yet, every December, after eight nights of lighting candles and saying prayers, my parents would go buy a Christmas tree while my sister and I wrote wishlists for Santa. And for years I thought this was totally normal (though I knew enough not to mention it at Hebrew school).
In my 20s, a Jewish boyfriend(ish) and I stopped off at my parents’ house one December evening. He looked around my parents’ living room, my mother’s Christmas village (don’t ask) in one corner, the tree in another, the handmade stockings for all four of us hanging from the mantelpiece, and he then looked at me as if I’d just admitted I was an undercover MI5 agent and had a heretofore unmentioned husband and four children stashed up in Manchester.
“Look,” I said, “Christmas involves family, an outrageous number of calories, the deification of a baby boy and the secular worship of a fat man with out-of-control facial hair: there are few holidays more Jewish than Christmas.” My mother appeared in the doorway: “Are you two staying for dinner? We’re having pork chops.”
The loss, I think we can all agree, was his.
And for a moment, I did feel like a bad Jew. Is this what I went to Hebrew school for, to celebrate Jesus’ birthday? But I know myself very well and one truth I have long accepted is that I’m greedy: I want the (vaguely religious) little Jewish holiday that sets me apart and the (largely secular) global one that lets me join the party.
Anyway, today is a proper Chrismukkah, because for only the fifth time in 100 years the first night of Hanukah begins tonight, on Christmas Eve. Something to do with the quirks of the lunar and Gregorian calendars (I’d explain this in greater detail but I used up my wordcount on the Helen Daniels joke). For us Chrismukkah Jews, this is, to be honest, a bit of a kick in the pants: we usually get to drag out our celebrations (and demands for presents) for a month – like the Queen’s birthday, only with more dreidels. But this year Christians and Jews (the properly observant ones, not the lightweight Chrismukkah ones) are all lighting their candles together, which, let’s face it, is an unexpectedly hopeful way to end a year defined otherwise entirely by divisions. And let me tell you, eating chocolate coins and chocolate Santas in one sitting is not just possible – it’s recommended. Happy Chrismukkah.

Avoiding politics at the dinner table may prove harder than ever this Christmas for families on opposite sides of Britain’s intergenerational Brexit divide.
Voters over 65 were more than 50% more likely to vote to leave the European Union than those under 34, and polls suggest opinions have hardened since. Divorce lawyers have already warned that differing views on the subject are also an added source of stress in many marriages.
At Thanksgiving, when American families gathered for the first time after the equally divisive election of Donald Trump, the New York Times was so worried it published a list of “election facts to keep handy for holiday discussions”. In the interest of similarly avoiding a post-truth Christmas in the UK, here is a festive bluffer’s guide to latest twists and turns of the Brexit debate to keep by the crackers:
Six months on from the referendum we know a lot more about the demographics of the electorate. A recent study by NatCen Social Research found the people most likely to vote leave were those without formal educational qualifications (78%), those with a monthly income of less than £1,200 (66%) and those in social housing (68%). Voters against EU membership were also more likely to be white, male, and readers of the Sun or the Daily Express. Anyone brave enough to point this out over Christmas pudding should bear in mind that just 9% of leave voters said they were regular readers of the Guardian. Remainers were also heavily concentrated in London, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but in a minority elsewhere.
In private, one European finance minister puts the chances of the Brexit “experiment” being abandoned as high as 25%. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has proposed the radical solution of Scotland staying in the single market even if the rest of the UK leaves. In London, it is hard to find anyone in any doubt that the UK government will at least have to give full Brexit a very good try before the next general election. There is always a risk that unforeseen events – another financial crisis or a wider EU unravelling, for example – can intervene, but the likelihood is they won’t. This is happening.
A supreme court judgment on the government’s right to start divorce proceedings by invoking article 50 without consulting parliament is due in the middle of January. The government is expected to lose, but the impact of the case has been undermined by growing signs that it could easily assemble enough MPs to pass the necessary legislation. An amendment to a Labour motion calling for more transparency in the process saw just 23 Labour MPs vote against their party whip in protest at the very idea of invoking article 50.
The Guardian’s latest Brexit barometer confirms that many of the more dire economic projections of the impact of a leave vote have yet to come to pass. That does not mean they won’t, though. There are already worrying signs of anxiety about Britain’s future trading arrangements that can be seen in the slumping value of sterling. EU negotiators are also threatening to extract a £50bn divorce settlement as the price of agreeing a post-membership deal which our ambassador has warned could take a decade. In the meantime, banks and carmakers are warning of an exodus if a transitional arrangement is not agreed to soften the “cliff edge”. Don’t throw out the candles just yet.
Ah. This is where lunch could get awkward. The truth is we don’t have one yet. Theresa May has said she will give a speech in January setting out the broad aims of Britain’s negotiating position. The Brexit minister, David Davis, has said he will publish a slightly fuller, but not very full, outline for parliament to debate in March. The prime minister also admitted to the Commons liaison committee on Tuesday that leaving the EU without any sort of agreement on the terms of divorce let alone future relations was one of several contingency plans that Whitehall was preparing for. There is now talk of soft Brexit, hard Brexit or “train-crash” Brexit, with the smart money increasingly on something between the last two.
Since my family will be having a vast Christmas dinner with a raft of Australian fly-in guests spreading through several rooms, I have made it known, in my position as patriarch, that I favour a simple solution to the question of which big bird to feature, goose or turkey. Magisterially, I suggested that there should be both.
Thus I dodged the question that stumped Theresa May, who was airborne when some pain in the arse of a reporter tried to frame her as a plutocat for favouring goose. Either the same pain in the arse of a reporter or a different one also tried to frame her for spending too much money on a pair of leather trousers. She dodged that question by implying, surely correctly, that her trousers were good for the leather industry, for British couture, and indeed for almost every living entity in Britain, except perhaps the animals from which the leather was peeled.
Anything to stave off the dumb reporters until the day arrives when Fleet Street finally twigs that Theresa is the biggest fashion asset to Britain since the first years of the Queen’s reign. When the penny drops, the smart reporters will be put on the case and Theresa will find that the quality of questioning she must face will go up by a mile.
I haven’t been studying the future president Trump’s schedule, but it’s a fair bet that he will turn up at No 10 before May turns up at the White House. Should the second eventuality prove to be the case, the president would be able to stave off awkwardness at the state dinner by giving the cue for another medley from Tony Bennett. But if the president is at No 10, he will be almost alone with her and face to face with what I am certain is his chief psychological problem. Like any other man who drivels about women when he is alone with a man, when alone with a woman, he has no clue what to say.
Hence Trump’s frequent verbal atrocities. They are all boasts and, like all boasts, they spring from an aching wish. My own guess is that Theresa, having sussed in advance that her interlocutor is a blithering saddo, will put him at his ease with an extravagant compliment about his non-existent personal magnetism. “That thing on your head is divine,” she will be already saying during the soup course. “So elegant, yet so masculine. How do you keep it in place? Surely only the strongest industrial adhesive can contain something so powerfully virile?” By that time, she will be breathing in his ear and he eating out of her hand. Cue violins.
Apparently there are people who don’t watch television at Christmas. The mind boggles. What do these people do with all that time, traditionally spent with their families? If they’re not arguing over whether Coronation Street or EastEnders is better or explaining to Aunty Esther that yes, Doctor Who is the same programme that they watched in 2005, but no, David Tennant hasn’t aged dramatically, are they actually conversing meaningfully with each other? And if so, what about? Because if you open up the Pandora’s box marked But Why Did You Vote Brexit, Granny?, you’re a bolder – and markedly more patient – person than I am. Because a Pandora’s box is still a Pandora’s box, even if it’s gift-wrapped with paper from M&S’s “Quirky” range that features a cigar-smoking Rudolph strapping Santa into leather reins while snarling “How do you like that, old man?”
Actually, the mind Boggles. Because, following my in-depth research, I discovered that these no-TV people do activities and play games, like Ludo, Cluedo, charades and “you be Tubbs, me be Edward”. Clearly, they are missing the point of Christmas. Because television is the point of Christmas. How else to explain that staff at the Radio Times sacrifice a not-insignificant amount of their sanity each year producing such mighty guides to the festive schedules? I worked on three Christmas Radio Times and those experiences are my Vietnam. Yes, even more so than the years slaving at The Guardian being paid only in magic beans and contemptuous looks from the people who went to Oxbridge.
But let’s not dwell on my workplace traumas. Television – especially Christmas television – is about unalloyed joy. It is being absolutely entranced by Den handing Angie divorce papers in the Vic. It is learning by heart that bit from Evil Under the Sun where Peter Ustinov’s Poirot enigmatically explains how he alighted on the identity of Arlena Marshall’s killer: “A bathing cap, a bath, a bottle, a wrist watch, the diamond, the noonday gun, the breath of the sea and the height of the cliff.”
It is, years later, watching Christmas episodes of Coronation Street and Emmerdale and being proud that I had helped storyline them. It is standing up for the start of the Queen’s speech, scattering an entire box of Maltesers far and wide across the living room and finding them under the sofa until, if you’re lucky/slatternly, Valentine’s Day.
While I’m not one to blow my own trumpet – why have a dog and bark yourself? – I was on the Queen’s speech once, in 1999. Given how manic my mobile phone went then (about four minutes 47 seconds in) with excited and bewildered messages, I’d say that more people than you imagine watch the Queen’s Christmas message.
These are Christmas traditions. Not only is television social glue – there was watercooler TV long before there were watercoolers – it is the essence of Christmas because television tells stories. And what’s Christmas but a story? It’s only where it is, temporally speaking, because early Christians wanted to pull focus from pagan celebrations of the winter solstice and such, and so came up with an alternative story. And then slaughtered those who didn’t prefer that story. (I know what’s gone on in the world: I listen to In Our Time. Ask me ANYTHING about the Baltic Crusades or the siege of Tenochtitlan and I will tell you).
Of course, the biggest story of all – stories are like lies but longer, remember – is that you’re meant to spend Christmas with your family, that you’re meant to have a good time, that Christmas is fun. While the best stories are fictions that illuminate bigger truths, this story – this lie – is just meant to make you feel bad if you don’t enjoy Christmas, if you don’t swallow the received wisdom, stuffing and all.
It is meant to make you feel guilty if you don’t look forward to the festive season with its rampant consumerism and endless tinsel-tinged songs on the radio, if you don’t don an elf-emblazoned jumper that would have Karen Walker – she of the cute angina – wagging a quizzical finger at Grace Adler and wondering “Honey, What’s going on? What’s happening? What’s that?”
As someone who grew up in a house where it was declared that Christmas was “an English thing” – apparently on account of Christmas historically not being a public holiday in Scotland – let me tell you that you are not alone in not thinking that Christmas is all that it’s crackered up to be.
That said, Christmas can be fun. If you watch television.
There will, of course, be a flurry of stories, around four days hence, that overnight ratings are down for the terrestrial broadcast channels for the umpteenth year in a row, as more and more people prefer to watch catch-up, on-demand and shows on Netflix and Amazon. I can’t pretend that I’m not a little sad at the lost prospect of the nation sitting down as one and watching the Christmas Downton Abbey and wondering when the actual story is going start. But things change. And in this, as in other respects, it’s best to summon the serenity to accept it.
Besides, it’s not as if everyone is abandoning what we used to call television all together. People still want to watch stories on screens, whether that screen is on the sideboard or in the palm of your hand. As I have only recently discovered the true meaning of “Netflix and chill” – and I now understand why men look so disappointed when I turn up at their door with a triple-box of Jaffa Cakes and rave reviews for Lady Dynamite – my opinion is probably not to be trusted. However, I cannot think of a more Christmassy show than Netflix’s The OA. It’s about existential loneliness. (I am only four episodes in, so NO SPOILERS, thanks). Like Christmas, it is occasionally funny but mostly emotionally gruelling. So much so, in fact, that it makes Jessica Jones look like Mary Poppins.
But before you get all excited at the prospect of headlines proclaiming that Netflix Killed Christmas, that will be next year. And that’s only if Donald Trump, Henry Kissinger and this impending fascist phase of neoliberalism doesn’t kill us all first. Seasons greetings, cannon fodder.
What is the Queen going to find in her cracker tomorrow? Whatever it might be, it is certain the cracker itself arrived in a box labelled “Tom Smith”.
The original Tom Smith has good claim to be the inventor of the modern Christmas cracker. This week the V&A museum revealed what is inside an un-cracked 1927 Tom Smith with a design celebrating a musical called A Romance of the Canadian Rockies. The cracker was given to the museum by one of the musical’s chorus girls. An x-ray of the “totem” cracker shows that it still contains a chocolate.
This kind of showbusiness tie-in was typical in the heyday of the cracker. In the Edwardian period, the Tom Smith Company was producing more than 200 designs a year.
Born in 1823, Smith was a confectioner whose research into new product ideas turned up the Parisian practice of wrapping a sugared almond in a piece of paper twisted at each end, sometimes with a printed “love motto” included, too.
Smith went into business in the 1840s from his Finsbury premises, and consumers soon fell for his “ingenious” and “dainty” packaged almonds. You can spot a wrapped bonbon – just like Smith’s – hanging from Victoria and Albert’s Christmas tree at Windsor Castle, which was immortalised in an engraving for the special Christmas edition of the Illustrated London News in 1848.
This influential image of the royal couple and their children helped to popularise the German custom of a Christmas tree in Britain. But perhaps even more significantly, it spread the idea that Christmas was family time. People started to spend it at home in their own parlours, and to spend money on toys, gifts and decorations.
Smith made his big break in 1861 with a new product line called Bangs of Expectation. For the first time, these were recognisable crackers with a bang. You didn’t unwrap them; you pulled them.
Tradition has it that Smith invented the bang while staring one night into the fire, and being startled by the loud snapping sound of a log. But the research of Peter Kimpton, an expert on the history of crackers and a former employee of the Tom Smith Company, has discovered a more plausible chain of events. He cites the testimony of a rival businessman, Mr Brock of Brock’s Fireworks Manufactory in Nunhead, London. Brock claimed that Smith cannily bought the chemical recipe for the bang from Brock’s own pyro-technician, one Tom Brown.
Smith, then, was rather like his fellow Victorian entrepreneur Thomas Crapper. Many people think Crapper invented the flushing toilet, but really he was just a marketing genius who stamped his own name on the plumbing products he sold to the public. Smith, too, took care to promote his goods as the original and best: “See Tom Smith’s name on every box,” he advised his customers.
And with the bang, Smith perfected the idea that a cracker was entertainment. In this, he was building on a long history of festive parlour games.
Cracker contents became non-perishable, to allow for wider distribution. From the 1880s, Smith’s son introduced the paper crown, harking back to the ancient tradition of the Lord of Misrule, a person of low status who would preside over the Christmas festivities in a medieval household in an inversion of the normal social order. On Christmas Day, even the humble are crowned king.
The company’s buyers scoured trade fairs for cracker gifts that were often rich and rare: perhaps a little fan from Japan, or a knick-knack in Bohemian glass.
In many ways, these cracker gifts encapsulate the Victorian passion for junk. Living standards were rising and pockets were jingling; manufacturers had cracked the secret of making “must-have” things to sell to other middle-class Victorians.
The love motto in Tom Smith’s crackers also has its own history. Victorian families would have relished the reading out of a sentimental poem such as this 1875 offering: “Oh flowers, sweet flowers, the fairest gems that earth upon her bounteous bosom loves to cherish.” In true Victorian fashion, though, the poem ends with death: the flowers, “like morning dreams … quickly perish”.
The poems became rapidly less romantic in the 20th century. As the range expanded, you could buy more specialised crackers, like the Suffragette cracker of 1910. Its motto ran: “We want (as quickly as we can) / To have our say / Most likely ‘yes!’ / And to become ‘a match for man’”.
Then there were crackers aimed at that novel creature, the motorist: “And my poor heart, oh is it fair / To puncture it beyond repair?” The descent from romance towards the groan-making pun of today’s cracker had clearly begun.
And the answer to the mystery of what might be inside the Queen’s own cracker? The choice has often been surprisingly low-key. “No diamond brooches”, cracker historian Kimpton says, “more often things like key fobs.”
Raymond Briggs would have good grounds for feeling every bit as grouchy as he likes to appear. Late last year, his partner of 40 years died of Parkinson’s disease; she had been ill for years, many more than he had realised. “You look back and think: ‘God, that was odd, the things Liz did.’ I came home one day years ago and saw this lovely carpet out on the grass. Extraordinary. Why throw it away? I couldn’t understand it. I mean, God almighty, it was very exasperating. But at the time, we didn’t know she was ill. It was this creeping, awful disease thing.” He inhales briskly. “Never mind. Bit of a bugger, but there we are, such is life. Never mind.”
This is the second time the illustrator has been widowed. In 1963 he married a painter he met at art school. “I wasn’t a madly keen marrying type or burning with love or anything. I mean, I loved her, but I don’t particularly approve of marriage as such. Or disapprove. It just seems pointless to tie up your emotional relationship with the law. Always seems awful to me.” But she had schizophrenia, “and we got married mainly because I thought it would help her mental state – give her a feeling of stability”. So although Briggs was “the normal sort of young arty type”, he saw little of the 1960s.
“I had a house and a mortgage and all that, and didn’t feel part of the 60s movement thing at all. I remember saying to friends, ‘I’m sick to death of hearing about these fucking Beatles. I’m not the least bit interested’.” His wife died in 1973, of “schizophrenia combined with leukaemia”. Under his breath, he mutters, “God, that was a jolly one-man-band.”
As Briggs talks, he shuffles around his cluttered cottage making coffee. Papers are stacked all over the place; he is currently making his will. “Terrible bloody business. They say: ‘Who is your next of kin?’ Well, I don’t have a next of kin. I asked [Liz’s daughter] Claire, ‘Would you mind being my next of kin?’ But she’s not my daughter, nor even a stepdaughter.” Now touching 50, Claire and her brother were at primary school when Briggs and their mother became a couple, but he never felt paternal towards them.
“No, I kept out of the paternal role. I made it a rule not to buy them anything for Christmas that cost more than a fiver, because I didn’t want to be saying, ‘Oh, look at me, I’m better-off than your father.’ I didn’t want to intrude in that way.” He pauses glumly. “Yes, it’s a funny old business, all this stuff. People idealise family life, don’t they? It’s not necessarily all that easy.” For that matter, “I’ve never been particularly interested in children at all, as such. Don’t particularly dislike them. But I’m not,” and his tone turns crisply disdainful, “a ‘child lover’.”
The bestselling children’s author was appalled to be considered a potential children’s laureate some years ago. “I didn’t see the point of that. It sounded awful. You go all over the country. Imagine it! The hotels and bed-and-breakfasts and taxis and trains, and really you just think: for God’s sake, what for? I suppose if you like that kind of public appearance, it’s alright, but I’d hate it.” He isn’t keen on lifetime achievement awards, either. “I’ve had one or two of those, and it’s a rather funny title, because come on, my lifetime hasn’t ended yet. But if you say you’ve got a lifetime achievement award, it’s like – well come on, get dead, man!” And he famously, of course, “hates Christmas”.
I’m not convinced Briggs is anything like the miserabilist he affects to be. For one thing, he follows every grumpy pronouncement with a light little laugh, as if in on his own joke. For another, he volunteers a touchingly tender memory of meeting me on holiday in Scotland more than 30 years ago. I was only a child, so I don’t think he can find kids an unmitigated bore. Tentatively solicitous, he offers up a plate of chocolate brownies with a gentle air of inexpert hospitality, and his bah-humbug misanthropy is difficult to square with his kitchen walls, which are plastered with handmade cards and children’s drawings. In a child’s handwriting, one card reads: “Raymond, you are really funny, lots of love, Matilda.” Another shows a child’s drawing of him. “Hideous caricature, you know. Doesn’t look anything like me at all.” But in spite of himself, he is grinning fondly, and points out a photo of a girl holding a copy of his book The Bear, which features a character called Tilly.
“This little girl fell in love with Tilly and the bear, so she made her parents call her Tilly, and was so insistent that in the end they changed her name legally. Best compliment I ever had.” He allows a bashful chuckle, plainly delighted. All over the rest of the wall are Christmas cards from the year before last. “Couldn’t be bothered to take them down,” is the mumbled and rather unconvincing explanation.
On another wall are posters of his two classic Christmas works, Father Christmas and The Snowman, making me wonder if he really does hate Christmas. “Oh, I do,” he insists, but the reason he offers is not one that would belong to an actual misanthrope. “It’s the anxiety. Have I spent enough, too much, how do I get it there, did I give her this before, has she already got this?” To me, he sounds like someone who cares very much about making others happy, but has never quite been sure how to get it right, and so learned long ago to disguise social awkwardness as gruff impatience. An anecdote he tells about receiving a second invitation to appear on Desert Island Discs only confirms my hunch that his big fear is not public acclaim, but making a public faux pas. “I was so relieved when towards the end of the second time the presenter said: ‘We’ve had you on before.’ I thought: ‘Oh, thank God, I didn’t think you knew, yes you have.’”
What he cannot conceal is his delight at the reception his latest film has received. “I’ve been to three or four screenings, and the audience has applauded at the end every time. Amazing! Amazing.” Peering at me, he enquires casually: “They don’t applaud at the end of a film in the cinema very often these days, do they?” Happy to confirm they do not, I’m nonetheless not remotely surprised to hear that they did for Ethel & Ernest.
The film is an adaptation of his 1998 book of the same name, and tells the simple story of his parents’ unremarkable lives. Briggs’ father was a milkman, who spotted a pretty housemaid shaking a duster from the window of a grand Belgravia house one day in 1928; he knocked at the back door, they courted briefly, got married, bought a house in Wimbledon, and doted on their only son, Raymond. Ernest was an irrepressibly happy-go-lucky working-class lad, Ethel a little less worldly but more aspirational. They remained happily married right up until their deaths in 1971, Ethel from dementia, and Ernest just months later from cancer.
The film will be screened on Wednesday 28 December on BBC1, and on paper sounds so slight that I was quite unprepared for its impact – poignant and subtle, yet powerful enough to haunt me for weeks afterwards. Through Ethel and Ernest’s ordinary, uneducated, innocent eyes we see the 20th century unfold, from the Great Depression and the rise of Hitler to the second world war and the welfare state; new-fangled mysteries such as television and telephones to the marvel of a family motor car, and the unfathomable sensations of the 60s – all the short-skirted women and long-haired men. Voiced by Jim Broadbent and Brenda Blethyn, Mr and Mrs Briggs are evoked so perfectly that their son spent most of the recording sessions in tears. “It was as if my parents were right there in the room. Uncanny. I don’t know how they did it so well.”
I’m equally at a loss to explain why I was moved to tears by a historiographically mundane recap of events we all know inside out. I had been floored once before by a Briggs film, but anyone could see why When the Wind Blows, his film about nuclear war, would have traumatised a teenager in 1986. It’s been years since that chilling dread of global Armageddon left me, so I ask Briggs why he thinks Ethel & Ernest feels so ominously resonant now.
“Ah, because now that dread’s coming back.” He reels off a few current trigger points – China and Taiwan, eastern Ukraine, Russian warships cruising the English channel – “and you think, my God, it could all be seen as utterly trivial – or it could be seen as something immensely serious. You just don’t know what’s going to happen, with a lunatic like Trump. And when we left that Europe thing, that Brexit nonsense, I was just so horrified. Crazy. When Nato and the UN were created, we thought it meant there could never be another world war. Well, there bloody well could be. Terrifying, isn’t it? Can’t believe it.”
Had Briggs made a film about his own life (“Good God, no!”), I wonder which world events we would have seen through his eyes? “Oh, blimey. That’s a big question.” He pauses to think. “Well, the worst thing was the Cuban missile crisis, wasn’t it? I remember feeling actual physical fear while that was going on. I remember looking out of the window of my bedsit in Wimbledon, and thinking: my God, by Monday all this I’m looking at could be a smoking ruin.”
He isn’t sure that he would still call himself a pacifist – “I don’t know, quite. Depends on the circumstances” – but is definitely no longer “solidly Labour. I used to be solid all the way through. But now I wouldn’t know who to vote for. I certainly wouldn’t vote Labour any more.” He despairs of his once-loved party under Jeremy Corbyn. “The whole thing’s just rubbish, isn’t it? Falling apart.”
No matter how politically bleak the world’s prospects, I had assumed Briggs could always console himself with his wealth, but when I say so, he looks astounded. “No, no, oh no. I’m not rich.” But The Snowman alone has sold more than 8m copies! “Has it? Oh, I expect the publishers just say that.” I’m fairly sure book sales are rigorously audited. “Oh. Really?” He looks genuinely surprised, but still insists he isn’t rich. “I don’t take any interest in it,” he adds. “As long as there’s enough to pay the bills, I couldn’t tell you how much I earn.” He hasn’t bought a house since the 70s, drives a second-hand Honda Jazz, and likes to shop in charity stores, so unless he has the world’s worst literary agent, I would guess he’s a lot richer than he either needs or cares to know.
I’m far from the first to notice Briggs’ temperamental resemblance to his crotchety fictional Father Christmas. But for all of his faux gloom, by the time I leave, only two of his grievances ring wholly true. He says he hates being old because “everything hurts”, he’s “TATT – tired all the time”, and random words keep eluding him. I believe him because they are written out in black marker pen as an aide memoire on his kitchen wall: probate, secular, prostate, migraine, narcissistic, sociopath, water chestnuts, merlot, post-script, Jim Broadbent, Brenda Blethyn, Katie Price – Jordan, ciabatta, diabetes, ragwort, Velcro and many more. The list would keep a Through the Keyhole audience guessing for ever, but Briggs has had quite enough by now of TV camera crews “poking around and moving bits of furniture. You don’t know whether they’re pinching things at the same time!”
Nor do I doubt the sincerity of his indignation about the Guardian’s review of Ethel & Ernest. “It said the film mentions my wife’s schizophrenia, but that it’s barely touched on. Well, what do you fucking expect? You can’t just embark upon schizophrenia when you’re writing about something else! It’s a huge subject. If you knew anything about it, you’d know you’d need half a dozen books to write about it.”
As for the rest of it, my guess is that however much Briggs, like his fictional Father Christmas, loves to grumble, he likes making us happy even more.

One Christmas day some 20 years ago, I was the prime suspect at what was almost a murder scene – at least in my head.
We had invited a lonely old lady for dinner. At that time, I reckoned I was pretty conscientious in my charitable attendance on those less fortunate than myself. I gave, but with discrimination. So, while I had concluded that there were occasions when it was OK to walk by on the other side, there were also times when it was not. Hence the Christmas hospitality.
My first encounter with Mrs C had been at a bus stop earlier in the year. She was a birdlike creature in her 70s, chirpy, stiffly moving on staccato legs, like an arthritic pigeon. On the ride home and on the walk to her house, as I carried her shopping, she chirruped incessantly.
She was high on the eccentricity spectrum, but in brief doses she was good company and I would drop by once every few weeks for coffee and a chat. As a result both of her own bad choices and of happenstance, she suffered from chronic loneliness, which had produced an obsessive need to talk, alongside a self-destructive inability to listen. She was a victim, which was how she came to be invited to join our family – myself, wife and seven-year-old son – for Christmas.
It’s always the little things, isn’t it? She arrived empty-handed, and in that nanosecond an infection took hold. Then she sat down, unbidden, in the “wrong” chair, and we were trapped in the presence of royalty. She held court. She simply never stopped talking, even when gabble-gobbling the food on which, to add insult to injury, she passed a couple of critical comments – and she had clearly fasted for a couple of days beforehand. We had four hours of an unbroken monologue about her life, its accidents, the state of her organs, her discontent with the world. And not a word to our son.
I think it was the latter that inflamed conventional irritation into thoughts of homicide. To keep these at bay, my wife and I – and, once he got the hang of it, our son – indulged a displacement strategy whereby we made faces, interjected irony, essentially subjected Mrs C to covert ridicule.
When I finally took her home, I felt the first drops of remorse. She invited me in and handed me three beautifully wrapped presents. Three days later, the remorse exploded into a tsunami when a handwritten note came through the door to say thank you.
That incident taught me something about charity, fairly apposite in this season of goodwill. It was her failure to conform to the role of grateful recipient that set my teeth on edge; it was her refusal to play the victim, her insistence on setting the agenda, on ignoring the basic social rules, that generated the homicidal reaction.
Yet here was I, a community worker, exhibiting all the traits of social hubris. I knew how suffering often intensifies the very behaviours that made someone a victim in the first place. I may not have known the detail of what life had done to Mrs C, what had made her so socially eccentric, but I should have known what to expect. And when I got it, when she asserted herself, I resented it.
I now recognise that the whole project of sharing our Christmas was flawed, and it taught me a salutary lesson. It taught me something about what could be termed benefaction. Caring can lead us to expect the objects of our care to be gracious in their receipt of our largesse, to accept unreservedly our support; essentially, to know their place.
And when they don’t, when the victim refuses to submit to their victimhood, when they insist instead on retaining ownership, they challenge our charity and we take offence. What I learned, that shameful Christmas, is that charity, care, whatever you call it, is essentially a two-way process, in which the recipients may be victims to us, but they are desperately seeking to restore the selfhood that the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune have eroded.
That is their right and, while we are distributing the Ferrero Rocher, it behoves us to pay attention. There’s a lesson for the 1% in there somewhere.
“Dad, why’s the Ooh Ah bird called the Ooh Ah bird?” asks Millie, her beautiful face glowing with Christmassy enthusiasm. “I don’t know,” I lie. “Because it lays square eggs,” she squeals.
She, Matt and I laugh uproariously at the well-worn joke from the 1977 Good Life Christmas Special. We love watching Jerry, Margo, Tom and oh-so-sexy Barbara (pre-pubescent crush lingering on) in this episode, Silly, But It’s Fun. It has been part of our festive ritual for many years. Margo’s Christmas order is not delivered – “Jerry, Christmas is cancelled” – before they have a simple but super day with their lovely self-sufficient friends next door.
This year is the first time we have watched it without Helen, but we are OK. Better than OK. In Yorkshire at the new cottage by the sea, we are playing out my vision of a place of sanctuary with family. If you half close your eyes, you might think Helen is still here, spreading her festive warmth and endless enthusiasm, love and laughter.
So far, it is working. Coming to the village that Helen knew and loved risked emotional seasonal meltdown, but the cottage is new to us and we are laying down memories of a new life without Helen as a physical presence, but with us in memory and spirit.
Amid the carols, Matt’s newly purchased dancing Father Christmas sings continuously and accurately – “Can’t touch Christmas.” It skims the surface of being bleeding annoying only because it does so in the style of MC Hammer, whose baggy-trousered performance I still have a soft spot for. Not so soft, though, that it won’t have a Boxing Day accident, knocked off the pier, weighed down with a Christmas pudding.
Getting up north was tricky. “You look buggered already,” said Pete over a festive dads’ beer before we left. I was a little jaded because I had drunk too much the night before after a melancholy ambush. I’d seen a fantastic art deco lamp and thought, “That’ll make a great present for Helen,” before catching myself in my mistake.
It has also been physically exhausting sorting every present, food order, playmate, invitation and the thousand other things Helen and I, but mainly Helen, had previously organised. I have now given up work, but that worry is lost in the mayhem and anticipation of the big day and a background fear of it being the first Christmas in 26 years without a gift from Helen. The only gift I want I can’t have – sad proof in a way that team Good Life would approve: Christmas doesn’t come by van or in a box.
Millie and Matt have been brilliant and raise my spirits; writing Christmas lists as usual and embracing the magic, I suspect as much for my sake as theirs. But it works. We have been out on the rocks collecting driftwood to fashion an alternative festive twigs tree and Matt is delighted to have found a very big piece of wood shaped like Rudolf’s antlers, on which he is hanging baubles.
Helen’s family are with us and this gives us more than enough critical mass for games and a general busyness that holds upset at bay.
Last year, a few days after Helen’s last Christmas, we visited Dennis Severs’s House in London. It is extraordinary, set up as though there is a family of Huguenot silk-weavers living there who leave the room just as you enter. The dining room has dinner set mid-meal, candles lit, with all the appropriate smells. You go around in silence, which helps the effect. With the kids so excited there is little silence here but enough room and general shenanigans to believe Helen is with us and has just popped on ahead. Far from being upsetting, I find it quietly reassuring, so powerful is her presence. A good place in every way. There’s laughter, optimism and joy.
This is the easy Christmas. I suspect we are all in shock and next year will be the acid test. Helen’s Aunt Lillian sent me a framed Emily Dickinson poem, Hope Is the Thing, which I had railed at because hope was defeated by death. Now I get it, and and, in a Dickensian inversion, we are all loving Christmas Present, comforted, not haunted, by Christmas Past. Christmas Future? We’ll be OK. Merry Christmas.
I wish I could remember what had made us smile. This photograph, which sums up my relationship with my aunt Gloria, is a window on to family Christmases past – to which she always brought generosity and energy, and a festive jumper.
I do know that it was taken more than a quarter of a century ago, on Christmas Day 1990. My shirt gives it away: silk, designer, my pride and joy, snapped up in Bloomingdale’s when I was breathless with excitement on my first visit to New York earlier in the year.
Gloria loved to travel and always encouraged me, my brother and sister to ask questions, explore new places and seize the chance of different experiences. With her, we went camping in France and the Scottish Highlands, sought out castles, windmills and stately homes, and trekked to the sights of London. It was Gloria who took me to my first Wimbledon, in 1975, where we cheered Virginia Wade into the quarter-finals from standing room on Centre Court, having risen in the small hours to queue.
When we were children, she drove us into the West End to see the Christmas lights on Regent Street – a moment of heart-stopping excitement. I doubt even the congestion charge would have deterred her.
As a young teacher, for a while she lived a charmed life in Egypt, full of sightseeing and dancing (including one memorable evening with President Tito of Yugoslavia, in town with his entourage). The joy of that time, which came to an abrupt end – via an alarming period of house arrest – with the Suez crisis, never left her. Three subsequent decades in the rough and tumble of education in the London borough of Hackney failed to drum it out of her.
When she died in 2008, we discovered a decade of letters between her and my mother, Laura, contrasting her adventures abroad with the concerns of 1950s domestic life back home: a suitcase of social history, which we later turned into a book. The aunt-shaped gap she left in all our Christmases and family events seems to grow, rather than diminish, with the years. As the photograph suggests, Gloria’s glass was always half full – and that, at least, I can remember.

“Merry Christmas you suckers / You miserable men / That old festive season is with you again / You’ll be spending your money on cartloads of junk / And from here to New Year you’ll be drunk as a skunk”
When we were growing up, we (me and my three older sisters) were spoilt each Christmas. My mum and dad’s parents were both alive so, on Christmas Day we had dinner with my mum’s parents and that was followed by Christmas tea with our other granny and grandad.
This meant that, as is the tradition in Germany, we had our own Christmas tree on Christmas Eve. This included putting up and decorating the tree (no long lead-in for us) adorned with lighted candles clipped to the branches. It was a real tree, so the fire hazard was equally real but, hey, it was the early 60s and a Christmas tradition.
Another Christmas tradition was playing a 45rpm vinyl record while we decorated the tree. Playing it once was never enough. Merry Christmas, You Suckers by Paddy Roberts was released in 1962 but much of the content (apart from the reference to waiting for the nuclear blast, perhaps) is as relevant today as it was more than five decades ago. It summed up our family attitude to Christmas (or did the record come first?) but, above all, I have fond memories of my dad laughing heartily each time he heard it (then whistling the tune until Boxing Day). I think this is the reason I liked it so much.

Rub the cooking fat into the flour until it is like breadcrumbs. Mix in the breadcrumbs, sugar, mixed fruit, mixed spice, ground nutmeg, apple, carrot and potato. Stir in the lemon juice. Dissolve the bicarbonate of soda into the warmed milk and stir this into the main mixture. Stir well and put in a basin, cover with greaseproof paper and steam for two and a half hours.
“This is a wartime recipe, but one my family prefers to the rich traditional kind,” stated my mother, Hilda Gladstone, in her contribution to the Cumbria-Westmorland WI cookbook published in 1978.
My sisters, cousins and nieces make this recipe every Christmas to keep the family tradition alive.
Sadly, Hilda died in her 80th year in 1996. However, many of her descendants, family and friends gathered in Cumbria in September 2016 for a weekend to celebrate what would have been her 100th birthday. In pride of place on the first evening was a Christmas pudding that I made to Hilda’s recipe, accompanied by lashings of Cumberland rum butter (in a Gladstone pottery sugar bowl, of course), cream and custard.
For the Cumberland rum butter, melt 225g (8oz) butter with 340g (12oz) soft brown sugar and add a teaspoon of ground nutmeg. Pour in half a wine glass of rum and mix well until it starts to thicken. Pour into an attractive old china bowl.
On the Sunday afternoon, a garden party saw 45 people tucking into my elder sister’s scones with homemade raspberry and blackcurrant jams, my younger sister’s thumb-hole tarts and Hilda’s “chocolate stuff” (tiffin), my Bakewell tarts and Victoria sponges, my cousin’s “nutty slack” (origin unsure, but contains cornflakes and nuts!) and other such specialities from Hilda’s farm table, WI cookbooks and the Be-Ro home-baking book.
Also on show during the weekend were many of Hilda’s exquisite examples of canvas work and rugs (all her own designs) plus string (baler twine) mats and craftwork. Each of these had been given as heirlooms, but only after they had been exhibited in WI competitions at various local shows.

My first Christmas in Britain was in 1979. I was nine. London was more monochrome then than it is now but, suddenly, unexpectedly, in December, it decked itself out in lights and sparkled with the magic of Christmas. People sang in the streets and smiled at strangers, a different place from the reserved city in which we had arrived only six months before, having fled the revolution in Iran.
We were living in a small flat that was the opposite of our house in Tehran with its rose garden and fruit trees, waiting for real life to recommence. At that point, we still thought that everything would blow over and that we would soon return to our country. In the meantime, while treading water in London, my parents sent us to a language school to learn English and for the first time that winter, Christmas properly penetrated my consciousness.
Back then, Christmas started some time in December, when modest decorations appeared in the shops and the lights went on in high streets, not immediately after Halloween, as now. In fact, it crept up on us and we only decided to get a Christmas tree and decorate the flat after mid-December had passed.
In Iran, Christmas wasn’t part of our calendar. Our nextdoor neighbours had been a Christian Armenian family, their blond boys my best friends. They had celebrated in January, and I had always wished them happy Christmas, not quite sure what it really meant. For us Iranians, the big festival of the year is Noruz, Iranian new year on the vernal equinox around 21 March. We knew about Father Christmas and the tree through films and books from the west, but 25 December, falling as it did in the middle of winter months far from the end of the Iranian year, went by unnoticed. In fact, on what was Christmas Day, we were at school.
My first Christmas experience was kick-started by a school visit to Oxford Street in London to see the lights and look at Selfridges’ Christmas windows. The department store’s grand facade was lit up and decked with little Christmas trees, the vitrines adorned in miniature scenes of winter, each telling a story, minute figures ranged around snowy settings busy acting out the festive narrative, which spilled from one window to the next. I remember the crowds and pushing my way through them to press my face as close to the windows as I could. I was enchanted, and talked about it with such wonder at home later that we visited again as a family. Thus was born our first Christmas tradition – the annual festive visit to see the lights on Oxford Street and gasp at Selfridges’ windows.
After that, my parents decided that it would be nice for us kids to celebrate Christmas, despite not being Christian. They wanted us to feel part of this new society we were inhabiting, and they wanted to cheer us up. Although none of us ever talked about it, we were all engulfed in depression at so abruptly leaving home, traumatised at being separated from family and friends. Christmas gave us a chance to put the fear behind us, to celebrate the sanctuary that Britain had given us by adopting its most important festival. My mother went to Harrods to buy a tree – the destination to find anything she wasn’t quite sure about in those first months – bringing home a box of baubles and multicoloured tinsel, too. My sister and I happily decorated the tree – a real one whose abundance of needles we found speared through socks for months after. They were so prolific that it was the last real tree we had.
Christmas did cheer us up in that lonely first year in London. My sister and I were thrilled at the prospect of receiving presents – it was the first morning since arriving in London that I can remember waking up excited. And my parents were distracted by inventing new traditions and rituals for us to embrace. My mother learned how to cook a turkey so well that, to this day, there is nothing more delicious to me than her Christmas lunch, and we gathered around the television to watch the Queen’s message.
The years passed, things didn’t blow over in Iran and we stayed in London. Now, once a year, I, too, sing in the streets and smile at strangers. And we still visit Selfridges’ Christmas windows each December as an expanded family, accompanied now by my partner and his children, too.
I was still young enough to harbour a hope that Santa might be flying from the north pole to my hometown in northern England, that his reindeers might soon swoop through the murky skies of Manchester, bringing me everything I had wished for, when I placed a mince pie, a carrot and a glass of milk beneath the chimney of my childhood home. I had, after all, been quite a good girl.
As I waited and wished through the night, I wondered about the existence of Santa, God and the tooth fairy. And I wondered why was I – a brown girl, who had not long before lit sparklers to celebrate Diwali, the Hindu festival of light – now waiting for Santa, after helping my mother to decorate the tree with stars, baubles and a crowning angel? Some stories are of such force in the imagination that they cut through religion, race and class, achieving universality.
Christmas was a tale of two homes for me, as my parents divorced when I was five. Sometimes, after mornings at home with my mother, my father would collect us and take us to my grandmother’s house. She lived above her shop that curved around a corner of Stretford near Lancashire’s cricket ground. She worked in the shop most days, but – like everything back in those days – it was closed for Christmas.
My grandmother had 27 grandchildren, and would shop at the Asian textile warehouses in Manchester for gifts for the grandkids, many of whom made her living room the epicentre of the world for Christmas. Over the festive period, as well as turkey we would eat Indian food – dal and rice and burfi (an Indian sweet) from the “curry mile” in Rusholme. In that same living room, I had recently acted out the part of Hanuman the monkey god in the ancient Indian epic the Ramayana, which my cousins, siblings and I play-acted. I had leapt across the living room, which was transformed by the imagination into a giant lake.
Such stories from different cultures made me aware of a world of narratives, rich and varied, that can coexist in the imagination. I was variously an angel in a nativity play and a monkey god in an Indian epic. I loved The Snowman as a child, especially the soundtrack, and every year I’d watch that (and attempt to build a real one if enough snow fell), along with films on TV such as Back to the Future, as well as the classic Indian film Disco Dancer, which often played at my grandmother’s house.
Christmas was ubiquitous, so it was difficult not to partake: at school, carols were sung, the nativity play acted, Advent calendars opened. But friendships were also forged across cultural divides throughout the year, so I have memories of attending friends’ barmitzvahs, for example.
The year was a blend of light and dark; Diwali celebrations exploded into bonfire night and melted into Christmas, which also entailed an annual visit to the glittering Blackpool illuminations and bright balls in the Funhouse. Then, after the bleak new year, the wash of colours of Holi, the festival of spring.
These days, I am not religious, though my extended family has many religions in it. My brother’s wife is Muslim, so my nieces, Asha and Layla, and nephew Hari celebrate Eid, too, to add to the array of annual festivities. On Christmas Eve, my nieces will also lay out a mince pie, carrot and glass of milk for Santa and his reindeers, and write him a letter. This year I’m hoping to read to them from The Girl Who Saved Christmas by Matt Haig – because celebrating Christmas is also about storytelling. As the far right takes hold across the world, the ability to recognise and appreciate varying viewpoints and sharing stories from different cultures is vital. Stories can be the greatest of all gifts.
“They tried to kill us, we escaped, let’s eat.”
This cheery summary of Jewish festivals may distress you. You may prefer the December holidays to be a season of light-hearted consumerism, when we mark the birth of Jesus by telling children that an obese, sherry-loving bachelor will climb into their houses at night and leave small gifts in hosiery. Surely there should be no place for death, or darkness?
Perhaps you’re right. But how else are Jews to face the fact that all our festivals commemorate attempts to exterminate us? How can we teach our children sweet little songs about Passover or Hanukah without mentioning the point of it all: slavery, plagues, oppression, bloodshed?
As all parents know, the answer is distraction. Give the kids enough sugar, in the form of cake or, better yet, anything deep-fried, and they’ll accept whatever you tell them. It’s a festive miracle. And it works.
Luckily for British Jews, the birthday of the infant redeemer is also about eating. This may be a godless, post-truth age, but the average Christmas table still groans with the foodstuffs of yesteryear: Bailey’s Pumpkin Spice liqueur, eggnog ice cream and gluten-free Thai-style stuffing. So it shouldn’t be difficult to create a fusion, should it? Particularly this year when, spookily, the first night of Hanukah and Christmas Eve coincide? Hanumas, Christukah (we’ll argue later): a perfect combination of latkes, mincemeat, stilton, When Harry Met Sally and only the most raucous carols. That’s the way, in adulthood, I play it. For my Jewish atheist parents, forging a secular path in 1970s Oxford, things were more complicated.
My Church of England primary school was hardcore about Christmas, so it was unfortunate when Hanukah coincided with the end of the Christmas term. After a long day of holy baby Jesus, I would barely have the energy to light the multicoloured candles my father bore proudly home from Paddington. Then the trouble would begin. My mother disapproved of Hanukah but, in the unsoundable depths of their marriage, a compromise had been reached. While my father speed-read prayers she would sit, arms crossed, rolling her eyes and saying: “Maurice! How much longer?” Then we’d sing Maoz Tsur, a mysterious festive song. No presents, no games, no sweeties.
What of the other cultural highlights? Our Christmas tree was a Swiss cheese plant wound with tinsel; our only real tradition was the construction of a cardboard Hansel and Gretel house from a kit, which we would plaster thickly with icing and then watch as the Lebkuchen slid off. Carols were awkward: too many references to “captive Israel”. I would bow my head and mime. And what to do about nativity plays? Just how Jewish was Joseph allowed to be?
The holy day itself was much like that of normal families. At least, normal north Oxford families. We would open stockings stuffed with pre-tangled Slinky springs and strawberry-scented pencils; we would wrest the paper from rollerskates (for my sister) and, for me, encyclopedias and, one glorious festive morn, a Texas Instruments Little Professor calculator on which I could perfect my maths.
Obviously, we had to eat. Ceremoniously, my father would make his best, indeed only, breakfast: real orange-juice, from frozen concentrate, and bubaleh, a sweetened omelette, the legacy of his Polish father. Then, while my grandmother started basting, he would take us to Port Meadow, the ancient common land that was the closest we ever came to wilderness. If one ignored the snowy thistles and horse droppings, it was a virginal, Arctic paradise, particularly the year when we fashioned skis out of red Formica planks from a skip and, on the slope-free grass, pretended to be having the time of our lives.
Better (worse) still was skating. Occasionally, the meadow flooded, then froze. My father, imagining himself as Goethe, bought a pair of ice skates at a jumble sale; they fitted none of us. That was the least of our problems. The ice was ridged with frozen tussocks; there was nothing to hold on to. While other children executed camel spins, we would take it in turns to inch towards the murky edge, ankles twisting, fingers raw, fail to stand up and eventually, sobbing, be allowed home.
Then, hosannah, we could eat. In another confusing shift from, or towards, tradition, our Christmas meal was goose, red cabbage, stollen, walnuts and marzipan. It was 19th-century Transcarpathia, apart from the occasional beeps from the handheld Game & Watch hand-sets my early-adopter grandmother had bought, and my muffled sobbing about my score on the Little Professor.
I have moved on, somewhat. At Hanumas I give books, but also large plastic electronic items; we have roast beef, red cabbage, and Cadbury’s Heroes; there is tinsel. We sing a quick bastardised chorus of Maoz Tsur, but I still don’t have the faintest idea what it means. We eat and argue. It’s the perfect Hanumas.
1. Don’t take pictures of your presents. Christmas is a minefield of potentially botched etiquette, and social media only makes it worse. And, clearly, the crime one can commit is making a fuss online about all the stuff you have been given. Look, we get it. You got a lot of presents this year. What are you, six? Ask yourself why you are doing this. Is it for likes? Is that it? How much extra validation do you need anyway, you weirdo? Someone just bought you a nice coat, and that should be enough. Now go away and think about what you’ve done.
2. It is acceptable to post a photo of your family in lieu of sending Christmas cards. Christmas cards are a pain in the bum, which is why you didn’t send any this year. They are expensive and bad for the environment, and there’s a good chance you’ll forget someone and then feel bad about it for ever. Instead, just take a picture of you and your loved ones, caption it “Merry Christmas”, and stick it on Facebook. It has exactly the same effect. Don’t worry about friends and relatives who don’t have Facebook. They don’t deserve your kind gestures.
3. Stop checking your phone all the time. Not only is it rude to spend Christmas Day staring blankly into the palm of your hand, but also it invites scrutiny you just don’t need. This is bitter experience talking here. I spent a lot of time on my phone one Christmas when Twitter was relatively new, and then had to spend the bulk of the day trying to explain to my family what Twitter was, what the point of it was, and why it wasn’t a stupid waste of everyone’s time. It is a stupid waste of everyone’s time, but that’s not the point.
4. In fact, put your phone away completely. Your phone is junk today. The only emails you’ll get will be horrific “Merry Christmas from GlaxoSmithKline! Here’s 5% off your next bulk purchase of Poligrip Ultra!” marketing newsletters, and all they’ll do is make you angry because they’re actively flushing the spirit of Christmas down the toilet. Just put it away. I promise you won’t miss anything.
5. Don’t Instagram your dinner. Instagramming dinner in a fancy restaurant I get. But leave Christmas dinner alone. What’s that? You’re having turkey, potatoes and vegetables? Well, guess what? So is literally everyone else. So don’t bother showing us. If I wanted to endlessly endure a slow trickle of gravy, I’d move three doors down from the cat-food factory.
6. No creepshotting drunk relatives. Yes, sure, it’s funny that your grandfather ate too much pudding and fell into the Christmas tree and the dog pulled his trousers down, but that doesn’t mean you have to take a photo of it and show it to the world. Certainly not without asking his permission first. Where photos are concerned, treat your relatives like strangers on the bus. Would you publish a photo of a stranger on a bus? You would? You monster.
7. You are permitted to tweet, but only infrequently on Christmas afternoon. Christmas afternoon is a wasteland. You’re too full to move, and too drunk to try, and this is the time of day where all the carefully observed politeness about basic acceptance flies straight out of the window. By 4pm, your dad will have started to tell the room loudly why Brexit was a good idea, and this will be your time to escape down the rabbit hole of the internet. Forget about likes or favourites or retweets, you should spend this time passive-aggressively howling at a wall of uninterested strangers. The survival of your family depends on it.
8. Don’t complain about any of this on Twitter. This is an important one to remember. If you see loads of people Instagramming their potatoes or tweeting about all their presents, or committing any other sort of festive social-media crime, keep it to yourself. Because if there’s one thing that ruins Christmas more than self-absorption, it’s pedantry. There’s a time and a place for that sort of behaviour, and that’s in a newspaper article that you’re getting paid to write.
Asking a roomful of people to pray for my testicles was a turning point in our journey towards having children. In the dark days of our childlessness and IVF treatment, my wife, Anna, and I began to seek every intercession we could lay our hands on. Then there were the prayers who actually did lay on hands. Although thankfully not directly on the affected area.
To use its wonderful medical term, I have oligozoospermia. It means I have a ridiculously low sperm count. I am a “jaffa” – seedless. We produce fewer than 15m sperm per millilitre of semen. It is believed to affect about 9% of men in the UK.
According to the National Fertility Association, the average man produces anything between 40m to 300m sperm per millilitre of semen. I am therefore, in this respect at least, a way below average man. Way, way below.
When I eventually plucked up the courage to get tested, my doctor told me over the phone that they had found only 37 in the semen sample.
“Thirty seven million – that’s not too bad is it?” I asked.
In the space of that conversation, I felt I’d had a vital piece of my masculinity – and one of the great gifts of manhood – ripped from me. I was bereft. The testicles that I believed were occupied by an army of supercharged Michael Phelpses, primed and ready to create babies when the time came, actually housed a pathetic handful of inebriated Eric the Eels.
I felt God had dealt me a cruel blow. That he had somehow diminished me as a man. My prayers became increasingly angry, confrontational and self-pitying. “Why me, Lord?” was a question I often asked.
Of course, up to that point, our struggles to conceive were not my fault. Consumed by a kind of “proud man syndrome”, I insisted that it must be an issue with Anna’s internal workings. Only after her various tests and proddings came up clear, did I eventually agree to give a sample. Thirty-seven poor swimming sperm would not get the job done.
I masked my despair pretty well. I made light of it, joked my way through. At one particularly lively birthday bash, I even took to the stage to spontaneously rap about my condition. There was pain behind those unrepeatable rhymes, though.
Low sperm counts are becoming far more common now. In the past 30 years, the quality and number of sperm has declined among UK men. Drinkers, smokers and stress-heads are said to be at greater risk. As someone who indulges in a glass of red, sucked in the fumes of countless Regal Kingsize until my mid-20s, and lives permanently on his nerves, I am a prime candidate. Or maybe I was just born this way. Who knows? The sad fact is that for such a common medical issue, too few men want to admit it, talk about it or even believe it could be affecting them. They suffer in quiet desperation.
One of the reasons for opening up my diaries in my new book, Becoming Reverend, was to seek to lift this veil of embarrassed secrecy. I reckoned that if I overshared the key moments of our IVF journey – and living in a spermless marriage – then perhaps other blokes would have the balls (albeit malfunctioning ones) to unburden themselves.
Let me be clear from the outset: IVF treatment is far more hideous for women. There are the drugs they have to inject, the yo-yoing emotions, the number of times their legs have to be attached to stirrups while medics examine and extract and insert things. It is our wives and partners who feel the pain most acutely when the treatment doesn’t work, not to mention the intense worry when it does. My wife noticed every tummy bubble, gurgle and burp, hoping against hope that it was the sound of a new life stirring in her womb.
As men, I think our suffering takes on a different hue. IVF stripped away my ingrained sense of male pride and dignity. It left me exposed, afraid and utterly dependent. I observed all manner of men when I attended my fertility clinic. But we all had the same pale, haunted look as we waited for our names to be called to the dreaded sperm donation room. I still wince at the memory of going in there for the first time with my plastic pot.
Once the deed was done, I was instructed to wait in the corridor until a nurse came to collect the pot. “It’s vital you keep the contents warm, though, Mr Woodcock,” they added. So I stood mannequin-like for what felt like days, smiling nervously at the passers-by, praying my semen-filled receptacle was getting enough heat stuffed down the front of my jeans.
Embarrassing, humiliating, and yet, for us, after three rounds of IVF, absolutely worth it. To hear the words, “You are pregnant!” To witness the two flashing heartbeats on the screen at our first scan. And then to finally hold, nine months later, two lives we had created. They were indescribable, life-transforming, miraculous moments. Whether it was a spiritual or purely medical miracle I can’t say with any certainty. That’s the point of faith, I suppose – it’s a mystery. It was probably a bit of both. All those prayers, all that medical skill, for me, combined to create Esther and Heidi.
I often wonder about the consequences of the IVF not working. I’m sure our marriage would have survived, flourished even. We’d have gathered ourselves, got on with it, and sought the next adventure. But our lives would always have had a space where children were meant to be.
As for my male identity, in a profound way, IVF taught me a new way of being. Out of my weakness I found a renewed strength. My masculinity was not somehow restored when Anna got pregnant. I didn’t break out into a chest-beating roar when the twins were born. It was actually the stripping away of some of my selfish pride, the fresh reliance on my faith in the face of hopeless despair, and the willingness to share those hurting places with the people I love and trust. That shapes my masculinity now.
It’s six years now since Esther and Heidi were born and the dog collar went round my neck. In that time, I have occasionally been called upon to minister to couples struggling with infertility. It has helped – I hope – that I can relate to their pain. I can empathise with their situation. My prayers for them are born out of real and at times bitter experience. That said, I’m also acutely aware that our IVF success may add to the confusion and frustration of those couples I’m supporting who remain childless. “Why does God not bless us with a miracle?” is a question I have been asked. It’s maddening that I don’t have an easy answer to it. I don’t believe one exists. I passionately believe God comforts us in our times of greatest distress – but why he intervenes sometimes and not at others remains baffling to me.
One of the great joys of becoming a priest has been the opportunity to encourage the blokes in my flock to open up a bit about such things as infertility. Not in a holding-hands-in-a-candlelit-circle-while-meditating-to-whale-music kind of way. That wouldn’t work in the centre of Hull. Instead, I run a men’s group where we laugh and share and banter about the stuff that matters and hurts. And I offer prayer, even when things seem lost and hopeless. In fact, especially then.

Being a good guest starts before you arrive. Reply to any invitation as promptly as you can. (If you can’t accept, say so early.) The answer to any invitation is yes or no; you don’t have to share issues with how you’ll get there, babysitters/parking/travel/what you’ll do with Granny and the dog. Talking of which, don’t ask if you can bring extra guests or pets who weren’t invited – that bit is your job to deal with.
1. The best guests are … hosts. No one has the potential to understand what is needed of a guest and how to behave more than those who regularly invite people into their own house. The worst guests are those who never reciprocate and never have guests round themselves. These are the people who think it is OK to ask an already busy host for a 33rd cup of tea and act as if they have checked into a hotel. Prefixing everything with “do you mind if we have?” does not make it better.
2. Never turn up empty-handed unless you are visiting the house of someone whom you also regularly host. Saying “I didn’t know where the local supermarket was” or “we came on the train” are poor excuses for laziness and lack of organisation. You do not need to spend loads (although a well-picked personal hamper always goes down well if you are staying overnight, but avoid chutneys because good hosts always have at least 15 different chutneys and they really don’t need more).
3. Do not bring food that has to be consumed during your stay but underestimates the number of people it has to feed. Unless it’s cheese. Do not have a complicated, indulgent list of what you or your children won’t eat. Unless you are allergic to something, the correct response to any food likes is “we eat everything and anything and are grateful for it”. Your host is unlikely to cook tripe and liver unless they hate you. And if there is something you don’t like, you don’t have to eat it.
4. When food is served, if there is something you don’t like, just shut up and avoid it. You don’t have to announce to the whole room that you will only eat line-caught fish, organic raspberries or that it’s “not your favourite” (I have done this, and cringe when I remember). Do not – ever – say the words “eating clean”. If you want a menu to choose from, go to a restaurant and pay for it.
5. Do not spend the whole time you are there on your phone. No one is that important. Do not bicker with your partner, children or anyone else in the party. Do not use this opportunity to espouse your political views or call Jesus into the fray. If you are a bad drunk, don’t drink. And if you plan to drink loads (but are a good drunk), bring some (good) booze. Do not use this opportunity to have a go at the host and ask why they are not married/don’t have children yet.
6. Make a positive comment on something to do with the house. Lie if you have to. Saying nothing, especially if it’s the first time you have been to someone’s house, is pretty shabby. Even if you ache with jealousy, find it deep in your core to say something nice. Passive-aggressive comments such as “this house must be a lot of work” just make you look very sad.
7. If you do drink lots of tea/coffee, ask if you can be shown how to make your own and offer others one, too – especially your host. Use the same cup each time, otherwise your host will have a nervous breakdown.
8. When the host sits down after a meal, this is probably their one pit stop before it all starts again for the next meal. Do not use this time to ask if your child can have a ham sandwich because “they didn’t eat much at lunch”. Tough.
9. Offer to do the washing up and bring your plate into the kitchen unless your host has asked you not to (some people don’t like anyone else in their kitchen). This isn’t so relevant if you regularly visit each other’s houses.
10. Leave when you said you would. If you are fussy about bedding, bring your own. Bring extra layers if you are visiting someone in the country. Don’t ask if they can turn the heating up (or on). Do star jumps.
11. Smile and enjoy yourself. The lowest impact guests are the ones who leave everyone feeling good, either by helping, or not hindering. If you get an invite back, you’ll know.
It is Saturday, the day I have set aside to buy the Christmas tree. All my sons are home and still in bed, and I have a vague plan to recreate a happy family expedition from days gone by, even though no such event ever occurred. I cherish my Christmas memories; I’m just not sure who they belong to.
“Wake up,” I say to the youngest one, driving my big toe into the small of his back as he sleeps. “It’s Christmas tree day.”
“It’s going to be fun,” I say. “Father-son-type fun.”
“Use a different son,” he says. “I’m ill.” I move on to the next room.
“No!” the middle one says, from under his duvet.
“It’ll be fun,” I say. “Fun, and compulsory.”
“Get someone else,” he says.
None of the sounds emerging from the other side of the oldest one’s door are intelligible. He was always the least likely prospect. I go downstairs to find my wife. “Christmas is cancelled,” I say.
“You could always go and get a tree by yourself,” she says.
“It’ll be rammed today, anyway,” she says. “You and I can just go on Tuesday.”
When Tuesday arrives, bleak and wet, I’m hoping my wife has forgotten about the tree. She can be irrepressibly festive on such occasions, and it always makes me feel as if I’m ruining Christmas. But she hasn’t forgotten.
We drive to the same church car park where we always buy our tree. We stare at the sign explaining how the different conifers are priced according to height.
“I hate this sort of thing,” my wife says.
‘What are you talking about?” I say. “You love this sort of thing.”
“Five years ago, we embarked on this exact errand, and you were insufferably jolly. Fact.” In truth, all our past Christmas expeditions are a blur. How many trees have we bought, decorated and disposed of?
“What about that one?” my wife says, pointing.
“Are you just saying that so we can leave?” she says.
“No,” I say. “That is indisputably the best tree here.” I pick it up and twirl it.
“OK,” my wife says, “I’ll get someone.”
As I stand there holding the tree, the sun comes out and my mood begins to lighten. There’s no point in both of us ruining Christmas, I think. It takes only one.
As we pay for the tree, something occurs to me. “We need a new stand,” I say. “We got rid of the old one after last Christmas.”
I’m not sure. I may have thrown it away, or it may still be sitting in the shed, full of dead spiders.
“Yes,” I say, selecting a new heavy-duty stand and placing it on the counter. “We did.”
“How much is that one?” my wife says.
“Don’t worry,” I say. “It’s an investment. It will last a lifetime.”
“We don’t need it to last a lifetime,” she says. “We don’t need anything that lasts that long.”
Our tree is netted and waiting for us outside. I hoist it over my shoulder. The whole expedition has taken seven minutes. I find this very pleasing: what we lack in Christmas spirit we make up for in brisk efficiency.
“We just need to go to Sainsbury’s now,” my wife says as we get into the car.
“Needs must,” she says. “There’s no food.”
I look behind me. The tree, pointing nose-first between the front seats, looks like a frozen dolphin. “OK,” I say. “But what if someone sees us?”
1 Start the day with a good bacon sandwich. You’ll be knocking back the champagne, so it’s sensible to get something in your stomach to get you through.

2 Make sure your bird will fit in the oven and you have a roasting dish large enough. Seriously, it’s happened to me before – big bird, small oven. One year, our oven broke, too. We ended up carving up the raw turkey and stir-frying it. 
Rachel Kelly
3 Less is more if you’re hosting Christmas for the first time. You don’t have to do it all, menu-wise or physically. Delegate to survive! Anyone who likes to chat, give them some peeling and they can talk to you at the same time. Give your creative friends the job of dressing the table and the person you like least the washing-up. Only joking. 
Melissa Hemsley
4 Be prepared. Everyone laughed at it, but for me making a Gantt chart was key to learning how to cook a big Christmas lunch on time. Work backwards from your intended serving time and be realistic about how long peeling veg etc will take. pchan, via GuardianWitness
5 Don’t try to cram everything into the same oven. The turkey should rest for an hour, loosely covered in tin foil and tea towels, giving you an empty oven in which to roast potatoes and other trimmings.

6 Don’t truss the bird – keep the legs loose and hanging free. The leg bones conduct the heat through the thighs, which take more cooking than the breast meat. If you truss it, by the time the legs are cooked, the breast meat will be dry. 
Peter Gordon
7 Make your stuffing in advance and refrigerate it. Sweat onions and celery for 15 minutes, add breadcrumbs that have had an hour to soak up full-fat milk, stick in an egg or two, and use butcher’s sausage meat with an unconscionable amount of salt. Sage should be fresh rather than dried, which is disgusting.

8 Don’t skimp on the gravy – in my family there is never enough. My brother only makes gravy from the cooking juices, so by the time his children have flooded their plates with this precious liquor, I’m left with a couple of dabs. I always make a simple chicken gravy a few days before, bolstered up with mushrooms, thyme and sherry, and then blended smooth. It’s ready to go as is, and I then add the roasting juices. If you are really pushed for time, there is a brilliant instant madeira gravy mix from Crosse & Blackwell. Speaking of which, don’t be embarrassed about using the supermarket or other sources of readymade food. 
Rachel Kelly
9 Add some redcurrant jelly to your gravy. I make my own jelly every year, but you can buy it. Thicken the meat juices with cornflour and add a big glug of red wine and some stock – a cube is fine. When the gravy is cooked through, add a couple of tablespoons of jelly, taste and adjust the seasoning. Great gravy every time.

10 For extra-crispy roasties, add half a teaspoon of baking soda to the water in which you boil them. The higher pH breaks the pectin down more quickly, giving you fluffier edges and more surface area to crisp up. 
Andrew Surrey, via GuardianWitness
11 Cooks’ muslin will keep your turkey moist. It needs to be big enough to double and go over the turkey – a metre should do it. Melt a pack of butter in a large pan and soak the muslin in it. Season the turkey, putting more butter and seasoning or herbs under the skin. Drape the muslin over the turkey to enclose it completely.

12 Gin is the solution. Just when things started to get stressful, oven smoking and pans bubbling, my dad would pour me the strongest G&T imaginable. Then I didn’t care if anyone liked their dinner or not.

What were you hoping for? 
A first chat that wasn’t stilted Tinder fare.
First impressions? 
Charming, warm and pretty easy on the eye.
What did you talk about? 
Family, Christmas, our plans for the future, and the queen herself: JK Rowling.
Any awkward moments? 
He doesn’t drink coffee, which was quite the reveal, but by that point in the evening, he’d built up enough good karma.
Best thing about James? 
Damn, that man’s a conversationalist.
Would you introduce him to your friends? 
There are friends I’m sure he’d get along with.
Describe him in three words 
Erudite, pleasant, groomed (in a good way).
What do you think he made of you? 
I don’t think I set his world alight. Which is fine. Nobody is meant for everyone.
Did you go on somewhere? 
We called it a night after dessert.
And... did you kiss? 
Only on the cheek.
If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? 
Nothing. It was a pretty solid night.
Would you meet again? 
He’s a great guy, but I think we’d be better off as friends. I look forward to receiving his press releases.
What were you hoping for?
Someone fun and chatty.
First impressions?
Super-welcoming and polite, but I knew straight away he wasn’t my usual type.
What did you talk about?
Work, family, hobbies, movies.
Any awkward moments?
A couple of awkward silences. I knew then this was nothing more than a nice meal.
Best thing about David?
His stories about New York.
Would you introduce him to your friends? 
I’d be more than happy to.
Describe him in three words
Intelligent, polite, friendly.
What do you think he made of you?
We had a fair bit in common, which I think he liked a lot.
Did you go on somewhere?
No.
And... did you kiss?
No.
If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
That it had been a Friday: I’d have liked more cocktails.
Would you meet again?
I don’t think we would, no.

Christmas, says the poet Lemn Sissay, divides the world into two sorts of people. One group gathers around the domestic hearth: all jocularity and teasing, memories and traditions. The other group is, as in the Victorian cliche, outside the window looking in. They have never felt the warmth of the homely festive glow.
Most of us have families who, even if it’s with some reservation, we join for Christmas. We roll our eyes and sigh, we anticipate the annoyances; we steel ourselves for the nuances that only we could ever understand.
Sissay, though, is a member of the second group. He was raised in care, first in a foster family and then, from the age of 12, in a string of children’s homes. Christmas came with the tree and the fairy lights, the baubles and the presents, but all those other unseen ingredients – the real flavours of the season – were absent; all those essentials that, as the Grinch finally realised, can’t be bought from a shop.
Given what he’s missed, it would be understandable if Sissay were resentful and scathing about how thoughtlessly the rest of us sometimes complain about something so vital and yet unknown to him. But he is not – he is magnanimous.
Yes, he agrees, all the things we take for granted about a family Christmas are a luxury. “They are a luxury, and you do take them for granted. But so you should, and so we all should be able to. We don’t walk around saying: ‘I’m breathing.’ But take your breath away, and you soon realise that you’re utterly dependent on it – and that’s the closest I can get to describing what a family does for you. Everything in life is connected, and everything is connected to family. People say: ‘If you’ve got no family, you can always have friends.’ But what they don’t understand is that your friendship-making skills are themselves connected to being part of a family.”
Sissay was awarded the MBE for services to literature in 2010. He is the chancellor of the University of Manchester, and in 2012 he was the official Olympics poet. “I probably look like a success,” he muses. “I seem like an achiever, someone who’s done well in life. But it’s an idea I’ve always struggled with. Because, when it comes down to it, who gives a shit whether I’m chancellor of a university? Who really cares?”
The people who would care, who always care, would be family; and that caring and that noticing and that reflecting who we are and what we have become is as intrinsic to this time of year as the presents under the tree. Christmas is a moment to pause, to look back, not just year on year but across a lifetime. And it’s about the future, too.
“Families are about the power of suggestion,” says Sissay. “When are you going to get married? When are you going to get a new job? All those questions that are a pain in the backside are also a wake-up call, a prompt.”
Sissay was born in 1967 to a young Ethiopian woman who discovered she was pregnant soon after arriving in England. She asked for him to be fostered while she finished her studies. Instead, the arrangement continued until Sissay was 12, at which point his foster family gave him up, and he was sent to a children’s home. From there, he was moved from one home to another, usually the only black kid wherever he was resident.
He was rootless; an unwanted parcel. And Christmas, as for any kid in care, was the hardest time: when the festive lights served only to expose what was missing, and would never be there. “It feels an incredibly risky time,” he says. “I used to fold myself into myself. All the memories were of Christmases that hadn’t been good.”
The truth about family, Sissay agrees, is this: its platform and its web, its support and its structures, are extraordinarily difficult to replicate in any other setting. Extraordinarily difficult, but not impossible: and yet the gap between what family life provides and what a life in care provides is a yawning chasm.
“‘Care’ is a one-word oxymoron,” he says, a flash of anger in his face. “If we were to truly replicate what a family is for the child who’s being looked after by the state, if the state was truly to provide that, it would give them the best of everything.”
But what society gives the kids is not the best; it’s the dregs. “After I left care, I was always being asked: ‘What did you do wrong?’ There’s this Victorian idea that there must be something bad about you if you end up in care. ‘If you’re naughty, we’ll send you to the children’s home’ … that kind of mentality.”
Sissay is fired up now. He is furious, not only for himself but for the hundreds of thousands like him, kids who grew up in this misnomer of a system. “Do you know the worst thing they said to me, the people who were in charge, when I was in care? They said: ‘What do you want? What do you want, Lemn?’ Those fuckers! How dare they! They had the gall to turn round to a kid and say: ‘What do you want?’ The whole care system is flawed, deeply flawed, and hopelessly unimaginative. I get so irritated when I hear people saying to children in care: ‘Why don’t you become a social worker when you grow up, so you can change things?’ How little imagination do these people have? Why should children in care become social workers … we’re not feedback machines for the system that fucked us up.”
So where should change begin? “I’d look at the nature of a functioning family and work out how we can replicate that for kids in the care system. One of the worst things that happened for me was that the big thing I needed was a hug, and a hug was the last thing I ever got. When you’re in care you’re acutely aware of how you’re not love or pleasure for anyone – you’re an obligation. Your social worker is just that – a worker. She or he is being paid. However brilliant your relationship with your social worker is, for them it’s a job. To you, it’s your life. And when you leave care, your social worker is no longer allowed to have contact with you. How does that feel for a young person?”
Sissay left care three decades ago, but he says you don’t leave it behind – part of you is always that rootless kid, that person with no one to chivvy or complain about, no one to boast to or moan about. And while he is not sure whether he would count much of his life’s work as achievements, there is one thing he is incredibly proud of. It is his Christmas present to hundreds of young people who, like him, have never had a family to be with at this time of the year. It’s called the Christmas Dinner, which he founded in 2013, and this year it promises a fabulous day to about 300 young care leavers aged 18 to 25 in five UK cities – London, Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool and Oxford.
The Christmas Dinner is run by volunteers, who persuade local businesses and organisations to donate food and services. Not just any food or services, though: only the best will do. Guests are picked up by taxi, and driven to one of the swankiest venues in town. Dinner is cooked by a leading chef, and the goody bags are stuffed with top-drawer gifts. “The thing is,” says Sissay, “I remember saying when I left care, ‘I don’t want to just survive. I want to live.’ And the Christmas Dinner isn’t about surviving; it’s about living.”
For the invitees, the event is life-changing. At one dinner last year, two sisters who hadn’t spent a Christmas together for seven years sat down side by side; another guest said that every year when the John Lewis ad was launched she felt really sad, but from now on, because of the Christmas Dinner, she wouldn’t have to. Megan Macleod, 21, who moved out of her foster home when she was 17, and who will be attending the Oxford meal, bursts into tears when I ask her what it will mean to her. “I just can’t believe they’re doing all this so we have a happy Christmas,” she says. “I’m super-excited for it.”
Of course, Sissay knows that one lunch, provided by one set of volunteers, shared by one group of care leavers, can’t provide everything that a family get-together does. But you only have to look at Megan’s face to see how much it means. And it isn’t only about the youngsters. “It’s about all the people who made it happen, getting them to think about care leavers and their lives,” says Sissay.
“Marks & Spencer has just agreed to give us the food, and there will be conversations happening there about what it means to be a young person in care. Up until now, some of those people probably thought care leavers equated to shoplifters. This might make them stop and think – because care leavers are incredible people. They are people with so many prejudices stacked against them. Their capacity for empathy is often extraordinary: they have to use other skills to make contact with the world, because they don’t have the skills people with families have.”
What about Sissay himself? He has never married, and has no children. He said he would never do that until he had found his birth family: but in his late 20s he did, and he is now in touch with his mother, who lives in New York. So yes, he says, he would love to settle down with someone; he would love children. He looks a bit startled by the question, as if it would be the gateway to a life that is still almost unimaginable. On the other hand, he now knows what matters.
“If I’m not defined by my success, I am defined by my ability to heal,” he says. “Because we’re all hurt, and we’re all healing.”
In 2017, The Christmas Dinner will be raising £100,000 for Christmas dinners throughout the country. Details are in The Seven Goals of Christmas blog; lemn@thechristmasdinner.org.uk
While Japanese families enjoy the Christmas Eve ritual of tucking into fried chicken and sponge cake, millions of love-struck, or simply lustful, couples will discreetly observe another festive tradition with a visit to a love hotel.
They will enter a dimly lit lobby and, after a brief discussion, select a room with the push of a button. Then, for just a few thousand yen ($25-30) – handed to an unseen receptionist – they will be free to make the most of their fleeting moment of privacy. As soon as they leave, a team of cleaners will prepare the room for the next occupants.
But Japan’s love hotels are suffering from a downturn in demand from amorous couples. Instead, they are pinning their hopes of long-term survival on a surge in the number of Chinese tourists that is stretching the traditional hotel industry to breaking point.
The backstreets of Tokyo’s Dogenzaka – nicknamed Love Hotel Hill – are quiet early on a weekday evening. But on Saturday, rooms at hotels with names like Amore, Elegance and Asian Resort will be at a premium as the industry cashes in on its busiest day of the year.
From huge, faux castles strategically located at motorway intersections to scruffy ferroconcrete boxes in the suburbs, love hotels offer not just privacy and anonymity, but an array of esoteric extras for couples hoping to spice up their love life.
If mirrored ceilings and vending machines selling sex toys are not their thing, guests can opt for “concept rooms” that re-create everything from the inside of an aircraft to tropical holiday resorts.
An estimated 1.4 million Japanese visit a love hotel every day, with rooms used by an average of 2.4 couples daily. Although there are no official data, analysts believe the industry is worth between 2-3 trillion yen ($17-25bn) a year.
Yet these are uncertain times for love hotels, so named after the first of their kind – Hotel Love – opened in Osaka in the late 1960s. The rise of single households and a decline in the population of 20-29 year olds – their target demographic – means there is less call for the role love hotels once played as an escape from extended families living under one roof.
“The love hotel business is going through a difficult time,” said Shigemi Sudo, director of the Tokyo Hotel and Ryokan (Inn) Association. “This is probably because more young people live away from their family home these days, so there’s no need for them to go to a love hotel.”
Helped by government subsidies, more love hotels are renovating their facilities to appeal to overseas visitors who may not want a room with a revolving bed and fluffy handcuffs.
A record 20 million tourists visited Japan this year, thanks to a weaker yen and groups of visitors from China, who make up just under a third of the total. Having reached that milestone four years ahead of schedule, the government has set an ambitious target of 40 million by the time Tokyo hosts the Olympics in 2020.
With international and tourists hotels unable to cope with demand, the accommodation gap is being filled by capsule hotels, backpackers’ hostels, Airbnb – and love hotels.
Eager to rid themselves of their association with purely carnal desires, some advertise themselves as boutique hotels or “urban resorts”. The number of hotels with an overtly sexual theme has dwindled to around 6,000 due to falling domestic demand and a 1985 law that required the industry to present a more wholesome image.
Dimly lit receptions have been replaced with cafeterias; in the rooms, tacky décor and vending machines selling sex toys have made way for bright colours and designer cosmetics.
Hotel Will in Saitama prefecture, for example, has retained its garish neon sign outside, but inside the pink wallpaper has been replaced with plain white, and the double beds with singles. A widescreen TV and refrigerator now take up space once occupied by huge mirrors. Only the well-appointed bathroom has been left untouched.
The hotel is packed with Chinese tourists, thanks to a contract with a Chinese travel agency giving it exclusive use for its clients.
“Many tourists don’t think love hotels are seedy at all,” said Mark Schreiber, a veteran writer on Japan’s sex industry. “Operators spend a fortune on fixtures, which are different in each room. One might be done out art deco-style, and the room next store might have a Renaissance theme.”
Hotel operator Manryo has turned three love hotels in Tokyo’s Asakusa district hotels into backpackers’ hostels by adding a bar and lounge. “It just so happened the love hotels became available to us after they got into financial difficulties,” said Manryo spokeswoman Erika Yamato.
Almex, meanwhile, advertises love hotel rooms to tourists via loveinnjapan.com. The English-language site includes a manga guide for first-time guests, and there are plans to launch versions in Korean and Chinese.
“Tourists are starting to use love hotels because regular hotels are fully booked, or sometimes just because they’ve heard that they are fun places to stay,” an Almex spokesman said.
Rooms that can be rented for a few hours at a time have been around in Japan since the Edo period (1603-1868). The first modern love hotels appeared in the 1960s to cater to couples desperate to escape their extended families, who traditionally lived under one roof, for a few hours of intimacy.
An Osaka-based association of small and medium-sized hotel operators believes love hotels can provide accommodation for an additional 28 million overnight guests a year, according to the Asahi Shimbun.
“Foreign tourists generally come away from their first stay at a love with a positive impression, and guidebooks all describe them as luxurious, clean and spacious,” said Schreiber. “And you get all of that for much less than a night at the Hilton.”

Blind date: ‘I wish it had been on a Friday: I’d have liked more cocktails’
Cabinet message discipline went awry on Saturday after Theresa May and Boris Johnson issued Christmas statements to the nation that came close to contradicting each other.
The prime minister and her foreign secretary did not disagree on policy, or party politics or the intricacies of Brexit, but on something more basic: whether 2016 was a good year or a bad one.
May went with an optimistic tone. “This year, the United Kingdom has had much to celebrate,” her message started. She went on to cite the Olympics and the Queen’s 90th birthday as national high points, but not the vote to leave the European Union.
As a Brexit supporter, Johnson might be expected to remember 2016 more fondly. But his opening was quite different and, in a video message posted on Twitter, he began: “We come now to the end of 2016, and I know that lots of people will be looking back at some of the gloomy bits about this year.”
He went on: “We’ve still got a terrible civil war going on in Syria, we are seeing terrorist outrages taking place in our European continent.”
Johnson, who delivered his message in front of a Christmas tree, assured viewers that British diplomats, armed forces and intelligences services were working to keep the country safe.
The foreign secretary later segued to a more positive tone. “In case you’re feeling too downcast this Christmas, don’t forget that overall the people of this planet are living longer, they are living in better health, they’re better educated than ever before, particularly women, and I can tell you that global Britain is leading that effort. So, hope that cheers you up,” he said. “Have a great Christmas and a happy 2017.”
May’s message was sent to journalists at 11am on Friday under embargo, for release at midnight. Johnson’s message was posted at Twitter just after 1pm.
May used the annual prime ministerial Christmas message to say that she did not want Brexit to divide the country. “As we leave the European Union, we must seize an historic opportunity to forge a bold new role for ourselves in the world and to unite our country as we move forward into the future,” she said.
Christmas was a time to “proudly celebrate the birth of Christ and the message of forgiveness, love and hope that he brings”, she added. “We also think of Christians in other parts of the world who face persecution this Christmas and re-affirm our determination to stand up for the freedom of people of all religions to practise their beliefs in peace and safety.”
She ended her message with a tribute to those working over the holiday period. “Having grown up in a vicarage, I know how demanding it can be for those who have to work over the Christmas period,” she said.
Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, focused on homelessness in his Christmas message, saying: “In the sixth richest country in the world, no one should be on the streets in the first place. But Shelter say that 120,000 children will spend this Christmas without a home to call their own.”
He said Labour values were the same as Christmas values. “It’s the goodwill and generosity of ordinary people, public service and charity workers who give tirelessly to help the most vulnerable and the lonely. They remind us of Christmas values: love for your neighbour, working together and hope – hope that things can be different. These are Labour values, my values and our values. They are values that remind us that together we can and will change our country for the better.”
Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, posted a Christmas video on YouTube, filmed in a centre for refugee children in Paris. He said he was “not at all squeamish about patriotism” and wanted Britain to be a country that did the right thing for people fleeing persecution.
Calling for the UK to be welcoming to refugees, Farron said people should imagine how they would expect other countries to help if Britain were a war-torn country and if Britons were fleeing abroad for their own safety.
In her Christmas message, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, also mentioned the plight of refugees. “Scotland has a proud reputation as a caring country and I want to thank everyone in the last year who has extended a warm welcome to those seeking refuge and comfort here,” she said.
She urged people to consider those in need of help or company over Christmas. “I would encourage everyone to take the time to check on a friend or neighbour who is on their own. It’s important to spend some time over the next few weeks giving comfort, companionship and support to those who need it,” she said.

Letters: If we want to make sure our most vulnerable people are not forgotten, we must bring some longevity to our charity
Three Christmas cheers for the Guardian and Observer’s appeal in aid of refugee children, for combining both the need for charity and change – and showing society that the two are not mutually exclusive.
The seasonal concern for others – from restaurants opening for the homeless to toy and gift donations – is always uplifting. But before Boxing Day morning has even begun, consumers will be splurging cash at the sales and government policy continuing to create the kind of desperate need that a few pounds in the charity tin at Christmas can never solve.
As a GP in Oldham, I will be spending the post-Christmas Day period tending the vulnerable who are made up of more than just the elderly and frail who have been failed by our fragile social care system. They will no doubt also include those experiencing stress-related illnesses, including desperate anxiousness caused by ongoing joblessness and the spectre of debt. While some individuals will have consumed about six times their recommended daily calorie intake on Christmas Day, my patients may also include malnourished children.
Homelessness has become this year’s cause célèbre – and given that three-quarters of them have physical health problems and 80% have mental health issues, they will no doubt be seeking medical attention too. Because of the government’s cuts to homeless shelters, many will be back on the streets in the cold.
Random acts of kindness must be replaced by a concerted sense of compassion 365 days a year. And charitable drives need to be accompanied by awareness-raising exercises that do not shy away from challenging government to examine disastrous policies such as the bedroom tax, which are beginning to bite and could leave thousands more people homeless.
One of the most famous charitable campaigns in Britain’s history is “A Dog is for Life and not just for Christmas” which warned that animals bought as pets are often discarded and maltreated following the festivities. If we want to make sure our most vulnerable people are not forgotten, we must bring some longevity to our charity and ensure it is accompanied by the kind of political action that can lead to sustainable change.

• Re the John Mullan article on representation of Christmas in literature (Review, 17 December), my favourite is the Christmas dinner scene in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Among many reasons is that until I first read it, I thought that only in my family was politics so near the surface that it would turn the most sacred occasion into mayhem at the slightest opportunity. And it had nothing to do with drink in our case, a tiny glass of port being all that was likely to be on offer. It was pure passion, and this Joyce conveys as no one else could. The Christmas dinner in The Dead has a similar quality of emotion, where tears and laughter have the same intensity.

• I read in last Saturday’s Guide (17 December) the review of what was described as “The festive 40” programmes for the Christmas and New Year season. It was a strange article. None of the list of 40 had any connection to Christmas at all and those programmes that did got no mention whatsoever – programmes such as Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve (BBC1), Christmas carols with Aled Jones (ITV1), Carols from King’s (BBC2), Christmas Day service (BBC1), On Christmas Night (BBC1) and Gospel Christmas (BBC2). It might pay the Guardian to offer some training on what Christmas is all about to the anonymous reviewer?

• Stuart Heritage asserts: “Elf on the Shelf isn’t a real Christmas tradition … It began 12 years ago as a self-published picture book in the US” (G2, 19 December). Well we had an “elf on the shelf” (or mantelpiece) back in the 1960s – he’s still brought out at Christmas but he’s now sadly missing his little Noel book.
When we took our young son to my mother’s at Christmas in about 1990, he was told the story about the Christmas elf on the mantelpiece – then later on, when he thought no one was watching, he went up to the fireplace and said to the elf: “I’m not afraid of YOU!”
So it probably is a tradition from somewhere – my grandmother was German – but has been co-opted commercially!

Enam Ali breaks off a small shard of poppadom in the dining room of his 94-seat, oak-panelled restaurant, Le Raj, in Epsom. The story behind this curry staple, and many others, has a uniquely British twist.
“The poppadom does come from India, but it did not originate for the purpose used in Britain,” says the Bangladeshi-born restaurateur and champion of the UK curry industry. In India, he said, poppadoms were like a bowl of crisps, but in the UK they were used to replace bread rolls and butter to accompany a meal. “Such a great story,” says Ali.
He then turns to other dishes that have made the long journey from India to Britain – and changed along the way. “If you go to India they will not be able to make you an onion bhaji like a big ball, because an English onion is big. In India they’ve got a small shallot.”
This is the type of story that Ali, 56, wants to tell on a television channel he is launching in late March that is dedicated to the curry dining industry in Britain. The sector has been a huge British success and is worth around £4.2bn. British curry is even becoming an important export: Le Raj flew out 25 turkey tikka masalas this Christmas to an artist in Italy.
That success story, however, is under threat from a worker shortage that has been brought into sharper relief by the Brexit vote. The curry sector, which employs 100,000 people in the UK, was overwhelmingly pro-leave, according to Ali. Brexit campaigners suggested that a quid pro quo for restrictions on EU immigration would be more visas for workers from Asia who will have the skills to work in the establishments owned by Ali and thousands of other curry entrepreneurs.
“The majority of curry restaurant owners support Brexit. Look at the Birmingham referendum vote and you can see how much Asians voted for Brexit,” he says, referring to a city that saw 50.4% of the population vote to leave. “We see that Britain has a value of equality with the world, so why is it that European people can just walk in? We are not asking for priority to be given to anybody; we just want to have equal treatment.”
From Ali’s point of view, the EU jobs market is not producing the right staff for his industry. He is trying to set up a catering academy in partnership with a local college that will include training kitchens and an on-site restaurant, but says he cannot find the calibre of applicants from within the EU. “I’ve been advertising since July,” he says. “But I’m not finding anybody to train. It could start tomorrow, but we need four people to train.”
The reliance on overseas workers is characteristic of the broader hospitality industry. Recent figures from the global software group Fourth found that 57% of all restaurant workers came from outside the UK, while the British Beer & Pub Association has called for an immigration system that will prop up staffing numbers at a time when there is a shortage of pub chefs. But the curry problem is more acute, because of the level of sophistication of modern Indian cuisine. It needs expert skills that are rarely found outside sub-continental Asia.
“Every day I’m hearing of a [curry] restaurant closing, because someone has said: ‘I’ve had enough. I’ll let it go,’” sighs Ali. As he speaks, a young Romanian waiter brings over a lamb shank dish, made from 22 spices that are freshly ground in the kitchen, at once demonstrating the difficulty in getting Asians into the industry and the level of sophistication that modern curry cuisine requires.
Meanwhile, tough immigration restrictions remain in place and they make it extremely difficult for curry restaurateurs to bring over the chefs they need. A chef from outside the EU must be paid £29,570 a year in order to qualify for a visa from the UK government, which becomes cripplingly expensive for restaurateurs once accommodation and meal costs are added. Worse still, sponsor licences cannot be granted to restaurants that have a takeaway service – a business model which is vital even to high-end curry houses like Le Raj.
Ali insists his proposal for a one- or two-year visa for chefs from sub-continental Asia, who would then return home having taken no welfare benefits from the UK, is gaining traction in government. This plan would add around 5,000 to net migration figures. Just before the referendum, Ali sat down with David Cameron in Downing Street to discuss his proposal and claims the then PM said “it was not right” that the takeaway rule was blocking appointments from overseas.
In his fight to keep the curry industry in a thriving state, Ali is also turning to the media. He is launching a 24-hour TV channel devoted to the sector, called ION, which will be based in a studio in east London.
“The channel will help the audience to understand the great British curry,” says Ali. “Our main target is industry news. It’s a new kind of channel to engage a new generation of hospitality.”
He also founded the British curry awards, often referred to as the Oscars of the industry. Presenters this year included a sari-wearing Duchess of York, the James Bond actor Colin Salmon, transport secretary Chris Grayling, and DJ Pat Sharp, unrecognisable shorn of his 1980s mullet.
Those awards, Ali’s Spice Business trade magazine, and this new channel are, he believes, vital to encourage the next generations of British-Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis to keep the industry alive. Ali’s son, Jeffrey, gave up a promising career with Apple to work in Le Raj, but other Asian families find their children are shunning a life in hospitality. This is a contributing factor to the curry crisis, which has seen hundreds of restaurants and takeaways close in the past two years, with fears that a further 4,000 establishments – more than a third of the industry – could soon follow.
After lobbying Cameron, Ali has a new incumbent to impress at No 10. He spoke to Theresa May when she was home secretary, and thinks Brexit and the need for new trade deals around the world will mark the “start” of the government getting to grips with the issue. Yet in a video message to the British curry awards last month, May did not mention the crisis.
Instead, she said: “Today curry is as close to the nation’s hearts as fish and chips. Right now there must be thousands of British families sitting down to a spicy meal at home and in local restaurants … This represents a great British success story which creates jobs, promotes growth, and contributes to the UK’s economy.”
Ali is hoping to get May as a first guest on his new channel. If she agrees, May will surely be asked to explain when she is going to lift those immigration restrictions to keep those restaurants, and that great British success story, going.
We must keep our views in proportion. The terrorist attack in Berlin (Nine dead in Berlin truck horror, 20 December) was awful, but why are we more upset about it than when a boat full of refugees sinks in the Mediterranean? I wonder how many lives have been saved by Germany’s open door to refugees? How many lost because of our closed door?

Inexpensive, thirst-quenching and very old-fashioned: keep a jug in the fridge as a pick-me-up for when you can’t face yet another boozy Christmas drink. Keep the cooked barley and use as pearly ballast in savoury wintry salads. And use lemon instead of orange, if you prefer. Serves four.
2 oranges, washed, zested and juiced 
65g pearl barley
1.5 litres cold water
1cm piece ginger, peeled and sliced
2-3 tbsp caster sugar, to taste
Put the zest in a pan with the barley, water and ginger. Bring to a boil, skim, then turn to a simmer and cook until the barley is tender: 15-20 minutes. Strain into a jug, add the sugar and stir to dissolve. Add the juice, chill and serve in tall glasses over ice.

The Christmas holidays are a perfect opportunity to catch up with friends in the best possible way: over a table of good food. Choose dishes that deliver on flavour, look great and are also deceptively simple: today’s stew, for instance, almost cooks itself. The doughnuts, meanwhile, need a little time to prove, but the kneading is easy and the boozy cream a deliciously decadent alternative to jam. So end the year as you mean to go on, and remind yourself of the power of great food and good company.
The sweet onion puree is a lovely backdrop to the deep flavours in the stew. Serves six to eight.
1.5kg beef shin (or other stewing beef), cut into 4cm chunks
2 tbsp plain flour, seasoned (optional)
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 tbsp olive oil
2 medium onions, peeled and finely chopped
1 carrot, cut into roughly 1cm dice
2 sticks celery, cut into roughly 1cm dice
350ml stout
350ml beef (or chicken) stock
3 star anise
3 branches rosemary
60ml red-wine vinegar
½ jar pickled walnuts, cut into slices
For the onion puree
150g butter
8 onions, peeled, halved and finely sliced
¼ nutmeg, freshly grated 
½ tsp brown sugar
1 small bunch thyme, leaves picked
Heat the oven to 130C/260F/gas mark ½. Toss the beef in the flour, if using; otherwise, season generously.
Heat half the oil in a large casserole on a medium flame, then fry the vegetables until soft, about eight to 10 minutes, seasoning well as they cook, then remove from the pan.
Turn up the heat and, when the pan is smoking hot, add the remaining oil and brown the beef in batches until caramelised all over (if you overcrowd the pan, the meat will sweat rather than fry, so it won’t brown and you’ll miss out on flavour in the finished dish). Once all the meat is browned, return the beef and vegetables to the casserole and add the stout, stock, star anise and rosemary. Bring to simmering point, then cover and cook in the oven for three hours. Add the vinegar and walnuts, season again to taste, and cook for another hour or so, until the beef is tender and falling apart.
Meanwhile, melt the butter in a wide pan, then add the onions, nutmeg, sugar and thyme. Season well, cook on a medium heat for half an hour, stirring from time to time, until softened but not golden, then blitz smooth with a stick blender.
Serve the beef over some of the warm puree, perhaps with braised red cabbage and mash alongside.
The cream in these homemade doughnuts is irresistible. Makes 50 mini doughnuts – allow two to three per person, and freeze whatever dough you don’t need.
7g dried fast-action yeast sachet
50g caster sugar, plus extra for dusting
175ml lukewarm milk
500g strong bread flour, plus extra for dusting
1 tsp fine sea salt
100g unsalted butter, cubed
2 large eggs, beaten
2 litres sunflower oil for deep frying, plus extra for greasing
For the cream
75ml armagnac (or brandy)
30g caster sugar
225g pitted prunes
Earl Grey tea (3 bags or 1½ tbsp loose-leaf), steeped in 375ml boiling water
200ml double cream
150g 70% dark chocolate
Mix the yeast in a small bowl with a teaspoon of sugar, then pour on the milk and leave to froth for five minutes. Whisk together the flour, salt and remaining sugar, then rub in the butter with your fingertips.
Make a well in the flour mix, and beat in the eggs and the yeast mixture. Turn out the dough on to a lightly floured surface and knead for 10 minutes, until it feels smooth and springy (or give it five minutes in a mixer with a dough hook). Shape into a ball, put in a lightly greased bowl and cover loosely with clingfilm. Leave in a warm place to rise for an hour, until doubled in size.
Meanwhile, heat the armagnac and sugar in a pan, stirring to dissolve the sugar, then turn off the heat, add the prunes and strained tea, and set aside to infuse for 30 minutes. Blitz smooth with a hand blender. Beat the cream to floppy, soft peaks, and gently fold into the prune mix.
Turn out the dough on to a work surface and knead for a minute. At this stage, freeze whatever dough you don’t need straight away and save it for next time. Divide the remaining dough into 30g pieces and shape each one into a ball. Lay these out on greased, lined baking sheets, making sure there is plenty of space between the balls to allow for rising, and leave to prove for 45 minutes.
Melt the chocolate in a bain-marie or microwave; keep warm on a very low flame. Heat the oil in a large pan to 170C. Frying three to five balls at a time, carefully drop them into the hot oil and fry for three minutes a side. Lift out with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towel, then repeat with the remaining dough.
Once all the doughnuts are fried, tip them into a bowl and dust with caster sugar. Arrange on a plate, drizzle over the chocolate sauce and serve with a bowl of the cream, for dunking (or use a piping bag to inject each doughnut with cream).
The beef improves after cooking, so make it ahead of time, if you can. It makes yummy leftovers, too, particularly on soft polenta or pasta ribbons with plenty of grated parmesan. Pickled walnuts are a fine accompaniment to cold cuts, particularly ham, and cheese plates. Excess prune puree is gorgeous spooned over morning yoghurt or stirred into porridge.
The most comprehensive analysis ever carried out of comedy panel shows has found that only once in the history of British TV and radio has a programme had an all-female lineup.
Of more than 4,700 individual episodes examined by data scientist Stuart Lowe, 1,488 programmes since 1967 have been made up solely of men. But only on one occasion in 49 years has there been a programme in which the presenter and all the panel were women – an episode of BBC Radio 4’s Heresy in January 2012 presented by Victoria Coren Mitchell.
Lowe, who trained as an astronomer, works at the Open Data Institute in Leeds. He compiled his research in his spare time over more than four years, after his irritated observations about the scarcity of women on comedy panel shows developed, he cheerfully admits, into an obsession.
He compiled his mind-bogglingly detailed research – which lists all the participants of every episode of every programme he could find over five decades – by trawling through the BBC iPlayer archives and those of other broadcasters, adding figures shared by other individuals who had done their own research into specific shows, and by trawling through back issues of the Radio Times dating from 1967, when Just a Minute first broadcast on BBC Radio 4.
While women still account for just 31% of appearances on comedy panel shows, the analysis shows there has been a steady and sustained improvement since 1989, when that figure was a shocking 3%. Statistically, however, the best year for equality remains 1967, thanks to the fact that for its first series, Just a Minute never fielded fewer than two women out of a total of five participants, including the presenter Nicholas Parsons.
The trend towards equality long predates the BBC’s announcement in 2014 that panel programmes without women were “not acceptable”. The broadcaster has been as good as its word, Lowe found. Since then, no nationally broadcast BBC comedy panel show has been screened without a female participant, though in some cases, such as Mock the Week, that number has been stubbornly stuck at one and no more for regular episodes.
“It’s a little bit of an obsession,” Lowe said, “and I’ve made a rod for my own back in that I have to keep it updated, which slightly drives me insane when I realise some weeks I’ve missed some panel shows and I have to go back and add them.”
So what keeps him going – a crusading feminism or a data obsession? “I don’t think they have to be at opposite ends of the spectrum. You can care about equality and about data at the same time. I think it’s a problem that half the population isn’t fully represented.”
Lowe has built his database to accommodate the potential scenario in which a performer does not identify as male or female, but as another gender.
Until last week, he had used an “other” category only once – for the tub of lard that appeared in place of Roy Hattersley on Have I Got News For You in 1993. The late withdrawal of Nicky Morgan from the programme last Friday, when she was replaced by an expensive handbag, brought that total to two.
Lowe also analysed the ages of participants by trawling through Wikipedia, and said he would like to measure educational background and ethnicity, “but that would be harder to do because I would have to categorise people based on appearance, and I would be reluctant to do that”.
The programme with the highest female participation, at over 60%, is Listomania on BBC Radio 2, though Lowe’s personal scoring index gives highest marks for a consistently equal spread of women and men to BBC2’s Insert Name Here, hosted by Sue Perkins.
Coren Mitchell told the Guardian she had initially hoped her all-female episode of Heresy – in which her guests were Maureen Lipman, Perkins and Cerys Matthews – would pass unremarked “as though it were completely normal. Of course that was screwed up by the continuity announcer on the night who went: ‘And here’s something unusual – an all-female lineup!’ So that scuppered that.
“The thing that surprised me is that it turned out to be the silliest episode of the series,” Coren said – neither less funny, as sexists might expect, or with some deeper feminist meaning. “It was just daft, very funny and very trivial.”
She added: “My theory is that, because productions usually put one woman on a panel show (or none) and stop there, women get used to having to (at some wearisome level) ‘represent’ female humour when we appear on these shows ... but with four women the pressure was off. It was nobody’s individual responsibility to prove anything. So we all got the chance to just mess about, relax and make free jokes like men do.”
Of 11 episodes that have had 75% or more female involvement since 1967, Lowe found, Coren Mitchell appeared in four.
Deborah Frances-White, a standup comedian whose own panel show, Global Pillage, is among a number of podcasts analysed by Lowe, agrees about the pressure female comedians experience when they find themselves the only woman on a panel.
“A lot of the time what people don’t realise they are watching is five men in their local pub – they are regulars, they look like everyone else and they are made to feel welcome – and one woman on a job interview. Because she knows that not only will [the audience] decide whether she is good enough to be allowed back on this show and other panel shows, but they will be judging whether all women are funny.”
Though it doesn’t solve the problem, increasing the number of women as hosts or regulars makes a significant difference, notes Lowe – he credits QI (BBC), 8 Out of 10 Cats (Channel 4) and E4’s Virtually Famous for all having recently appointed female team captains or presenters.
ITV’s Celebrity Juice and Play to the Whistle both have female hosts or team captains, and Saskia Schuster, the commissioning editor of comedy entertainment at ITV, said the broadcaster was always “conscious of the mix of voices we are bringing to the show, whether that’s gender, race, class, age”. However, she acknowledged that TV had “some way to go” to reflect the increasing numbers of women entering the traditionally male-dominated comedy scene.
“As an industry, we definitely need to achieve a better balance of gender on our shows and this is what we are pushing for from our producers and guest bookers, so that the discussion moves on from gender representation and eventually ceases to be a discussion at all,” she said.
A Channel 4 insider said it was committed to more women working both on- and offscreen on its major panel shows, saying the production teams on some of its highest-profile programmes “skewed heavily female”.
A BBC spokeswoman said the broadcaster was “keen to make sure our programmes reflect our audiences”, which was why it had led the way on committing in 2014 to having women onscreen on every show. “We are proud of the roster of funny women we have across television and radio. Whilst these figures show there is still more for all broadcasters to do, it is encouraging to see a trend towards better representation of women in recent years,” she said.
While some see more women making a career in standup, Lowe acknowledges there are still fewer women on the comedy circuit. His best estimate last year, based on an analysis of Chortle’s database of working comedians, was that about 18% of standups are women. “People are right to say that the comedy circuit is a problem – and that isn’t the broadcasters’ fault,” said Lowe.
But even taking that percentage into account, he said, one would statistically expect those programmes that appear stuck on a maximum of one female guest to have a number of episodes where there were two or three women, “and that just isn’t happening”. For any bookers still struggling to find funny women, Lowe has compiled a list of 168 of them – he welcomes further submissions.
Some have argued that the heyday of traditional panel shows is fading, while female comics are thriving in other formats on TV and radio, from Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag to Catastrophe, co-starring and co-written by Sharon Horgan. A spokeswoman for Radio 4 said it was proud to include “lots of talented female comedians” on panels, but added: “Panel shows are only part of our offering, and next year we have brand new shows from the likes of Sara Pascoe, Sarah Kendall and double act Lazy Susan.”
Danielle Ward created BBC Radio 4 Extra’s Dilemma and Do the Right Thing, which she presents on Comedy.co.uk; the latter recently filmed a pilot for Channel 4, with Claudia Winkleman hosting. “If I achieve nothing else in my career, my panel show pilot had five women on it,” she tweeted after filming. “Fuck yeah.”
With both shows, Ward said, she and her producer have very deliberately booked diverse panels, and she never has more than two straight white men: “It’s not about being a corrective. I’m just not interested in hearing four straight, white comedians talking about themselves. The conversation is never going to be as interesting.”
For the same reason, Ward said she would not book four straight women. “It’s not about correcting it in terms of numbers, it’s about offering a sense of conversation that’s beyond just one narrow pool of people.”
The new year got off to an impressive start with a headline that managed to blame childless women for the struggling economy, NHS meltdown and shorter life expectancies. Plague of locusts soon expected to follow.
US talk show host Wendy Williams criticised singer Kesha for speaking out about alleged sexual abuse: “If everybody complained because somebody allegedly sexually abused them ... contracts would be broken all the time.”
In a month of inane cleavage obsession, everybody, from talented actresses to politicians, became obsessed with puns about their breasts. It made for an exciting new journalistic angle that delighted readers everywhere, and certainly didn’t make women want to stab their own eyes out.
The new junior doctors’ contract openly discriminated against women. Luckily, we were repeatedly reassured that “any indirect adverse effect on women is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim”, which made women doctors feel much better. Meanwhile, April also saw legendary abolitionist Harriet Tubman become the first woman in the world to be told, “give us a smile, love”, 100 years after her death, when her appearance on the new $20 bill wasn’t cheerful enough to satisfy some men. 
Muirfield golf course proudly confirmed its utter lack of connection with the 21st century with a vote to keep female members out, only to later suffer cruel revenge when the female population of Edinburgh excluded its members from sitting on a particularly fetching park bench. Touché. 
The murder of Labour MP Jo Cox by rightwing terrorist Thomas Mair threw a spotlight on the ongoing abuse faced by large numbers of female MPs – and suggested that perhaps it might be dangerous to normalise violent threats as a way to silence an uppity woman in a position of power. 
Leslie Jones received racist and misogynistic Twitter abuse for the cardinal sin of taking part in an all-female movie remake. Meanwhile, Nottinghamshire police’s decision to record misogyny as a hate crime was met with widespread panic, but fears of innocent men being locked up for compliments were proved misplaced when women instead reported abuse and assault.
Olympic commentators desperately competed for the honour of providing the “most sexist coverage”, and men worldwide were gifted some insightful advice about how to talk to women in the street, even when they are wearing headphones and might not want to talk to you. Meanwhile, France’s burkini ban proved that trying to score political points through the misogynistic policing of women’s bodies and choices never goes out of style.
A woman Nasa astronaut was “corrected” on Twitter by a man who had once been to space camp. He provided inspiration for another 2016 hero who later in the year challenged renowned Cambridge professor Mary Beard, mansplaining the fall of Rome, based on what he had seen in Gladiator. 
Tapes were released in which Donald Trump boasted about grabbing women “by the pussy”. When women objected, #RepealThe19th began trending on Twitter, as Trump supporters effectively reassured them that there really wasn’t any misogyny to worry about after all. Meanwhile, footballer Ched Evans was acquitted of rape following the admission of evidence in court about his accuser’s sexual history. This news was met by online vitriol matched only by that spewed in her direction after he had been found guilty in his first trial. 
Every woman in the world gave a sigh of recognition as Hillary Clinton was beaten by a man infinitely less qualified than her to do the same job. Meanwhile, Moroccan state TV made important strides towards eliminating domestic violence by showing a helpful programme showing women how to use make up to cover it up. 
Article 50 claimant Gina Miller received a torrent of racist and sexist abuse online after making a legal challenge to Brexit, noted anti-feminist MP Philip Davies was elected to the commons’ Women and Equalities committee, and Fifa announced it had solved the problem of getting girls into football with nice-smelling bibs. And finally, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who pleaded guilty to battery charges after police said he punched and kicked his girlfriend 117 times in 2013 (although he disputes the extent of his assault) was given a great new job at a venture capital firm, while still awaiting sentencing. Because if 2016 has taught us anything, it’s that allegations of sexual assault don’t ruin a man’s career.
I am the eldest of four children of a single mother. I have two sisters and a brother, who is the second child. He is now 40, but does not have a career, friends or money. He still lives at home with our mother and does not contribute to bills.
Our mother worked hard for us and we never went without. There were money problems, but the rest of us were resilient enough to deal with them. We three girls have careers, partners and children and have been living independently for years.
My brother, however, plays the victim card. For example, he blames my mum for pushing him into the wrong degree – not true. He has done odd jobs over the years. He worked in one place for a long time but refused to go for higher-paying management positions. He feels he is too intelligent for such roles.
This has gone on for the past 20 years. He is perpetually angry, abusive and belligerent with us. When he is around non-family members, he is charming but with us he is rude and aggressive. He shouts at and abuses my mum, and my biggest fear is that he will hit her one day.
As a family we have offered to pay for counselling (he refused), we have given him money and bought him things. But he doesn’t appreciate it. He seems to think he has suffered some kind of injustice in life. He doesn’t take any responsibility for his life and even now will say that his predicament is everyone else’s fault. He refers to things that happened 20 years ago, and makes things up from the past to justify his victim status. He will say that we ruined his life and it’s because he did what we “wanted”.
He has been given opportunities to live away from home, but refuses. He lives with my mum while resenting and blaming her.
I have told my mum to kick him out, but she is reluctant. I don’t know how to make her be stronger. He acts like a baby, so she treats him like one. She was not this soft on the rest of us, especially me. I no longer speak to my brother.
I have said my mum should say that he should have therapy or move out. If he ends up on the streets, so be it. We have tried for years. I am sick of it. My mum is in her 70s. She no longer has the strength for the arguments.
I wasn’t sure how seriously worried you were about your mother being hit, as it wasn’t the focus of your much longer letter. If your mother is ever in danger she must dial 999 – assault is a criminal offence. I have also put a link at the bottom of the column, which you may find useful regarding the other aspects of abuse you mention.
I wonder if, growing up, you had to adopt a mothering role with your brother? You seem to have more of a parental relationship with him, rather than a sibling one. How do your sisters feel? Where is/was your dad? When did he leave the picture and why? Sometimes it’s what you can’t see, what isn’t mentioned, that is incredibly relevant.
I contacted psychotherapist Leila Bargawi (childpsychotherapy.org.uk), who notes that you seem quite “critical that he wasn’t more resilient”. There does seem to be a lot of disdain for him – the only boy. Bargawi also wonders if there was a narrative in your family about the men being losers. Maybe they were, but if it were presented as a gender, rather than person-specific thing (men are hopeless; women are resourceful and resilient), that may have had a big impact on all of you, but especially on your brother growing up without, it seems, a positive male role model.
Bargawi also wonders if somewhere along the line, unconsciously, your mother and brother were company for one another and if in some way “your brother has actually protected you all. He was the one who stayed at home while you were all able to go and do your own thing.” Maybe your brother felt overly responsible towards your mother, hence him saying that he did what you all wanted him to. Maybe this responsibility has now turned to resentment.
There is something “quite adolescent in your brother’s behaviour”, notes Bargawi, who says, “his emotional development may not have gone to plan”. And we both wondered if, in some way – subconsciously – your mother was getting something out of him being at home (and vice versa, despite his anger). This will seem incredible, but nowhere in your letter did I get a sense of how your mother felt about all this – only about how you feel. Your mother, by your own admission, is reluctant to chuck him out.
What can you do? Well, you cannot make your mum chuck him out, any more than one of your children in the future could make you throw out one of their siblings. Bargawi suggests that perhaps you can “find it in you to be supportive. Maybe remember a time in childhood when you got on. If he is always going on about his childhood, maybe there is something about that time that he needs to unpack.”
I think you need to ask yourself some questions: “Why am I so angry with my brother? What do I want to achieve and is it achievable, and what would happen if I did nothing?”

We’re pootling along winter-sun-dappled roads overhung with ancient trees, their limbs drooping leaves of ochre and butterscotch and vermilion. It could be another century, one where I’ll be tucking headscarf under chin for a postprandial along Honey Lane to admire the unchanging countryside.
Our destination could also be from another century: a former pub in the village of Burchetts Green, notable for its bunting-clad infant school, agricultural college and… well, that’s about it. The Crown is family-run – but what a family. Exuberantly barnetted paterfamilias Simon Bonwick is alone in the kitchen, while several of his nine children – yes, nine, and all as perfectly presented and smilingly scrubbed as Von Trapps – work the room. The eldest (Dean, I think) laughs, “No, we’re never short of staff.”
There’s a classic, French-accented prix fixe at lunch (three courses for £25: cromesquis and crépinettes and cassoulets), but we order à la carte, to put Bonwick through his paces, and also because prices are (for this part of the world) eminently reasonable. Recent Michelin stardom has seen these creep up a little (understandable), but it’s still possible to do the full blowout for two with wine for around a ton.
That this is Bonwick’s empire and sole vision is evident from everything that issues from his kitchen; his mission, says the website, is “cooking and serving the kind of food I like to eat”. Generosity is a keynote: a crab starter delivers an unholy amount of chunky white meat bound with the lightest mayonnaise; on top, petals of skinned, full-flavoured tomato and julienned apple; and, drizzled about, a sharp, fruity dressing dotted with toasted cashews, a genius move that highlights the crab’s innate sweetness. Far more butch is a slab of fatty rillettes of sanglier (wild boar), a powerful, funky thwop of porcine meatiness sharpened by crisp beer pickles and tiny pearl onions.
Plates are clean and unmessed with, untroubled by today’s trends for the splatter, crumb and blob. Food looks like what it is: it’s all deliciously old-fashioned. Duck breast of perfect rosiness and crispness of skin has “a rather nice duck sauce”: demi-glace, booze, pan juices, I’m guessing, all glossy and rich. Alongside, a duck forcemeat ball topped with witchy tendrils of trompettes, a flourish of just-wilted buttery spinach, fondant potato in the shape of a little muffin, a prune and a roast beetroot: each element is distinct, but all pull harmoniously in the same direction.
Romney salt marsh lamb, chestnut and garlic is every bit as dedicated to delivering the essence of each ingredient: straightforwardly good food. Menu descriptions are smile-inducing: “Treacle Sponge ‘Hot’ Like When You Are Little”. I’d have liked the sponge a little denser and gooier, but with homemade vanilla ice-cream, it’s still comfort in a bowl.
The Crown is simple, unstuffy, as far from its tortured Michelin stablemates as it’s possible to be, a happy marriage of gastropub and restaurant. Bonwick is clearly an adherent of classic French technique: the full Larousse of turned veg, and stocks and demi-glaces reduced into such lip-smacking richness, you just know they’ll stiffen into intense jellies as soon as your back is turned; plus elaborate desserts – “Black Forest ‘cadeau’”, say, is chocolate and cherries wrapped in white chocolate, like a perfect little gift.
The Crown inhabits a fantasy world, a world of Wodehouse combined with a soupçon of Pie In The Sky; the peachy, cooking-pots-and-gewgaws decor could easily have landed from the 70s. As we leave, Bonwick leans out of the kitchen window to wave a cheery goodbye.
This is the kind of small idyll that the horrible white men taking over our world are promising their froggy choruses, uncaring that they’ll never be able to deliver. Now there’s a wry irony: the atmosphere of fear and anxiety they’ve created is making even the likes of me long for this kind of backward-thinking solace, too.
In Burchetts Green, the duck will always have a crisp skin, glossy sauces will always trickle from little copper saucepans, the treacle pudding will always flood the mouth with soothing, sticky sweetness. Fires will continue to crackle in the bar where the ghost of “a small bearded man with a pony” is occasionally glimpsed, and The Girl From Ipanema will warble in the background. In this tiny corner, at least, all will be right with the world.
• The Crown Burchetts Green, Maidenhead, Berkshire, 01628 824079. Open Weds-Sun, 12.30-2pm, 6.30-10pm (closed Sunday dinner). About £30 a head, plus drinks and service.
At my church, Holy Child Jesus in Richmond Hill, New York, Mondays are usually a day of routine: the collection is counted, messages are answered and the building is swept and mopped and put back in order. There are rarely any surprises.
That’s how it was all morning on 23 November last year. The only irregularity was the assembling of the nativity scene the church displays every year. Recently ordained, I’d only been assigned to Holy Child Jesus in February, and was surprised to see our custodian Jose putting it together as I arrived. I remember thinking it was too early (we hadn’t even had Thanksgiving) and made a mental note to talk to Jose about it after lunch.
My own morning schedule included a meeting with two parishioners who were preparing for their wedding. Partway through, my phone started ringing. I apologised to the couple and ignored it, but my secretary came to the door and said, “Father, can I interrupt – there’s an emergency in the church.” I excused myself, saying I would be back as soon as I could.
As we walked over to the church, my secretary explained: “Jose says he’s found un niño.” In Spanish, niño means boy, so I imagined a child who had wandered out of school or perhaps run away from home. I know most of the young kids in the neighbourhood and had already started imagining whom it might be. I was in for a big surprise.
Jose was standing near Mary’s altar, where I’d left him earlier that day assembling the nativity. I could see no sign of a child, but as we approached he said: “I went out to lunch, and when I came back I found him.” I followed his gaze to the nativity scene, and that’s when I saw him huddled inside and wrapped in a towel – the youngest baby I’ve ever seen.
The towel was wet, probably from the birth, and after carefully unwrapping the baby we discovered the umbilical cord still attached. He was dark-haired and healthy looking – there was a little dried blood in the creases around his neck and on his body, as you would expect with a newborn; but he seemed unharmed and wasn’t even crying, just cooing and gurgling, apparently content.
We called 911 and alerted a local school nurse, who told us the baby probably wasn’t more than a few hours old. While we waited for the ambulance, I ran back to my room to fetch clean, dry towels, calling into my office where the couple were still waiting. I told them we’d have to reschedule.
The baby was taken to a nearby hospital. We weren’t allowed to visit, but soon heard that doctors were happy with his condition. Meanwhile, the news spread fast. Even as police tried to track down the child’s mother, my parishioners started discussing potential names. Emmanuel and Jose were mentioned; Jesus, inevitably, was popular.
His mother was found within a day or so. I gather she’s a young woman, just 18, who had come from Mexico and was living with an aunt. She had hidden her pregnancy under baggy clothes and given birth alone in her aunt’s apartment.
Footage from surveillance cameras showed her stopping off with the baby at a convenience store and buying the towel. The police estimated he couldn’t have been alone for more than 15 minutes before Jose found him. Apparently, the mother had tried two other churches before walking into ours, the first that was unlocked.
She wasn’t prosecuted; New York State’s safe-haven law allows desperate parents to leave newborns in a safe location. Confidentiality rules mean we haven’t been told if the baby has been adopted or returned to his mother, but I like to imagine he’s still part of our community. I just feel blessed that he was left with us. I’ve always considered our church a place of love and compassion, and I’m proud we provided a frightened young woman with a place of refuge.

Bigger bubbles could make your champagne taste better this Christmas, research has found.
It was long thought that a steady stream of tiny bubbles in a glass of champagne was a sign of quality. But researchers in France’s Champagne-Ardenne region have found that larger bubbles may actually improve the way a sparkling wine tastes.
Bigger bubbles – about 3.4mm across at the surface – dramatically enhance the release of aerosols into the air above the glass, the experts found. It means important aromatic compounds that give champagne its distinctive smell and flavour are flung into drinkers’ noses when they take a sip.
Prof Gérard Liger-Belair, a physicist at the University of Reims, who led the research, said: “This result is remarkable as it undermines the popular belief that the smaller the bubbles, the better the champagne. Small bubbles were the worst in terms of aroma release.”
About 1m bubbles form in the average glass of champagne, according to Liger-Belair. They are a result of dissolved carbon dioxide, which forms in the wine due to a second fermentation process that occurs during production inside the sealed bottles.
Using high-speed photography and imaging techniques, Liger-Belair and his colleagues have been able to study precisely what happens to a champagne bubble.
In a study published in the European Physical Journal Special Topics, they show that the bubbles form a regular hexagonal pattern on the surface. When one collapses, it creates a cavity that stretches the neighbouring bubbles, producing a pattern that looks similar to the petals of a flower, creating an avalanche of tiny droplets that are thrown into the air at the top of the glass.
Wine experts often use bubble size as a marker of quality, with larger bubbles found in cheap sparkling wines such as prosecco and cava.
Liger-Belair said bubble size in champagne and sparkling could vary from between 0.4mm and 4mm across. The viscosity of the drink and the glass it is poured into could all influence how big the bubbles were. But bubbles with a radius of 1.7mm across resulted in the highest number of droplets evaporating at the surface of the drink.
He said the research could help lead to innovations that could improve the taste of sparkling wines. “We showed that decreasing champagne viscosity would improve drop evaporation,” said Liger-Belair. “Additives that would change wine viscosity without changing the taste might be used. These results pave the way towards fine tuning of champagne aroma diffusion.”
It is the latest in a long line of research by Liger-Belair and his colleagues. They have shown that chilling champagne can help to reduce the amount of alcohol carried in each bubble, which can prevent more delicate flavours from being overpowered.
Cooling a bottle of champagne to 4C (39F) can help reduce the speed of the cork as it leaves the bottle, preventing accidents, the team found. Tilting the glass when pouring can also help prevent it from overflowing.
Drinking from a flute rather than a wider glass can help to enhance the flavour because of how bubbles mix in a glass. Liger-Belair said: “Bubbles in a glass of champagne may seem like the acme of frivolity to most people, but in fact they may be considered a fantastic playground for any fluid physicist.”
With deft accuracy, a design worker is sticking sparkles on a gift bag in an office festooned with crackers, wrapping paper swatches and shelves loaded with multicoloured glitter.
Based near a former colliery in south Wales, a team of 45 designers work on new creations for IG Design Group – the world’s biggest producer of wrapping paper and crackers. The team started designing for next Christmas in August. One worker says she often gets home to find glitter in her car, on her hair, even on the dog: “It can be Christmas every day here.” 
Loss-making and struggling under a mountain of debt in 2008 after a string of acquisitions, IG has survived by restructuring, and broadening its product ranges to include stickers, gift bags and other new products alongside traditional wrap and cards. The wrapping paper is made in Wales while the design team’s other creations are turned out at IG’s factories in China and the Netherlands.
Paul Fineman, chief executive of the group, says order books for next year are “heaving” because the drop in the value of the pound post-Brexit has boosted demand from abroad.
The group produces 1bn m of wrapping paper a year, almost half of which is made in Wales. It supplies all the major supermarkets and major international retailers including Ikea and Costco. Upmarket crackers, under the Tom Smith brand, sell for up to £500 and will be adorning the royal Christmas dinner table.
In October, IG sent a selection of four specially selected cracker designs to Buckingham Palace so that the Queen could choose one to grace her Christmas table.
Its products may be swathed in glitter, but the factory in Ystrad Mynach, a short drive from Newport, is an example of gritty British survival against the odds.
Previously IG had three sites – one where wrap was printed, one where it spun huge printed reels of paper onto cardboard tubes and another where goods were packed up ready for stores. The group spent £8m on bringing the whole operation together in one site two years ago. It switched to using more environmentally friendly and efficient water-based inks and introduced new processes that can add glitzy touches such as holograms and shiny finishes.
“In 2008 we had to seriously think whether we could make this a viable facility,” says Fineman. “It was loss-making and had a lot of issues. We had choices and one of those choices would have been that this place didn’t have a future as a manufacturing site. But we felt if we could remodel, find different customers and channels and create a sufficient resource to invest that not only could we survive but it would be very profitable. It was very challenging but it is working.”
IG’s enormous printing machines have 10 heads that layer ink onto a polymer roll on which the design has been laser cut so it stands proud like a giant potato print. Paper from reels more than 1m thick is fed through the printing system before being dried in a long oven and then sliced in half as it is spun back into another thick roll.
The plant can print 72km of paper an hour, and employs up to 450 people at peak times about half of whom work in manufacturing.
From September the printing machines are working 24/7 right up until Christmas week to cope with late orders from British retailers. Production restarts for next Christmas almost immediately and shipping begins from June or July with boxes of wrapping paper packed off to Bristol docks and shipped over the Atlantic.
The company is having a good year. Underlying sales were up more than a fifth in the six months to the end of September with profits up 36% as gift bag sales soared.
Fineman says the fall in sterling will bring another boost. “The UK is going to be a very uncertain place. But over the next 12 to 18 months UK manufacturing, the number of cards sold is up 5% year on year.
“Sending Christmas cards has declined other than single cards to close relatives. “People aren’t just writing out cards to their colleagues at work. But there are new occasions and reasons to send cards all the time. People just see a card and think ‘that’s fun’ and get it. There doesn’t have to be a specific reason any longer.”
IG is also trying the same trick with crackers – with versions for Halloween and Easter. Some of the crackers are designed in Wales but they are made at the company’s factory in China from which it ships to 29 countries. Last year it imported 60m crackers to the UK – nearly one for every person in the country.
And who writes the jokes? The company employs a network of freelancers, but anyone can contribute an idea. Even Fineman claims to have contributed a couple over the years, although he won’t reveal what they are. Maybe it’s the one about “tinsel-itis”.
Christmas has 12 days, and they are all brilliant, but Christmas Eve is the best of all. The anticipation of all that lovely downtime and TV and permissive snacking is as delicious now as it was when you were hyped up to the eyeballs at the excitement of waking up to a stocking on the end of the bed and eating chocolate coins in the dark with your little sister.
It is also the most elegant day of Christmas. Tomorrow is about stuffing endless recycling sacks with wrapping paper and gorging yourself until you can’t move, but today the presents are under the tree and you can still fit into your clothes. It is without doubt a day to dress up for.
Even – no, especially – if you are staying in. We get into the habit of dressing up to go out and dressing down to stay in. If I’m going out to dinner, I think about what to wear; if I’m at home, I think about what to cook. It’s just practicalities, really. Going upstairs to change for dinner is all very charming in Downton Abbey, but in the absence of downstairs staff, it’s hard to make it work without jeopardising the risotto.
But Christmas Eve deserves star treatment. I’m talking cashmere, velvet, sequins, feathers. I don’t care if your plans involve Nigella’s make-ahead bread sauce and the only outing on the agenda is a last-minute dash to the shops for AA batteries: this is a night to bring the glamour. And I mean the gratifying, pleasurable part of dressing up, not the breathe-in-and-think-of-England party dresses. Fabrics that feel good and look special, in shapes that are easy to wear.
I like the relaxed, cocktail-in-hand-hostess attitude of a pair of wide, loose trousers, which you can wear with a silk T-shirt or over a long-sleeved body. I love a cosy, curvy sweater dress, especially with polka-dot sheer tights. But this year I want a mermaid skirt. We associate sequins with a brazen, short-and-tight mode of dressing, but they come into their own when worn with grandeur. There is something magical about sparkly scales slinking about your ankles, especially when worn with a silky blouse. Tomorrow you can spend in your PJs and slippers, but tonight is when the magic happens.
My grandparents would take me out fishing in their boat once a week from when I about two or three, growing up in in Texas and Louisiana. I loved it. The biggest fish I ever caught was a 1,200lb marlin – but you name it, and I’ve caught it. I don’t get to go out as much these days, but I still enjoy it when I do. I find it calming.
For most of my childhood I had casts on both my feet. So I was always falling in the boat and knocking things overboard. There was never a dull moment on that boat. One time, I cast out and ended up hooking Poppa, my grandfather, in the head. He was sitting in the back, so I couldn’t see him. I just kept yanking and yanking and ended up setting the hook in his head. So we had to go to the hospital, and every time we hit a wave, it would send shocks down his spine. Poppa joked I’d caught the biggest fish of the day. It was pretty funny.
My grandfather started taking me hunting when I was six. We’d hunt deer. We wouldn’t always get stuff, but we enjoyed it. We’d drive out in the woods, make a camp and wake up at about 3am. I had my own rifle. I’ve only shot one deer in my life, though, when I was eight or nine.
My parents got divorced when I was nine months old, and my father would only pop in and see me once a year, if that. I don’t have much contact with him. He remarried when I was quite young and they had their own little family. He does his own thing. We are kind of estranged. But I don’t feel like he’s missing from my life. My mother and I are extremely close and we still live together, along with my 12-year-old sister, Lacey.
I didn’t know anything was wrong with me when I was growing up. I thought everyone went to occupational and speech therapy, I thought these were common things. I thought I was quite normal until I went to school and someone told me it wasn’t normal to have a disability. That was shocking to me. I asked my mom, why did this happen, why am I affected this way? She told me, and we moved on. You have to accept what can’t be fixed, and live for today like there’s not going to be a tomorrow.
My mother was paralysed for six years, from a month after my sister was born. She was in a car accident – a car ploughed into her at 40mph – and ruptured her spine. Afterwards, she couldn’t lift Lacey because of the operations she’d had. So I took care of Lacey. There’s a 12-year gap between us and her dad wasn’t really around, so I guess I was a bit of a father figure to her as well as a brother. I changed her diapers, made up her bottles, fed her, rocked her, bathed her - everything, I did it.
I had a lot of responsibility at the age of 12. By 13, I was the main breadwinner for my family. It was scary but necessary. I started off working as an extra, and I had to keep getting jobs to pay the bills. It evolved into a career very quickly. I think that accident changed our lives. It changed the dynamics of my relationship with my sister. Lacey is my baby, my little girl. We are still very close.
I take my sister everywhere with me. I’ll take her to dinner, to parties – anyplace I can bring her, I will. She’s 12 but looks like she’s 24 so I don’t have trouble getting her in anywhere. Despite the age gap, it feels like we have everything in common. We both like watching cartoons and playing video games, and we’ll make music together – she’s a singer. But of course, we have moments when we fight, that’s part of being brother and sister and living in the same house. It’s inevitable.
I was eight when I found out I was adopted. My step-brother told me. He’d overheard my mum and my stepdad at the time talking about it, and he threw it in my face. But I didn’t really care. It didn’t seem relevant, because I never once in my life felt unloved or like I was a burden.
I do and don’t want to trace my biological parents. If I find out, I find out. If I don’t, I don’t. I’m not really looking for them. I’ve got so many other problems that trying to find my biological parents is not something that I want to deal with right now. It’s not a priority ... unless they’re loaded. If they’re loaded and deceased, and I’m in a will somewhere, I’m all for it. Or if they’re part of the royal family, that would be pretty rad, too. Other than that, I don’t really care.
My mom and grandparents always said to me: you can do whatever you want. Can’t wasn’t an option for my grandfather. If I told him I couldn’t do something, he’d tell me I was going to do it. He’d say: because you told me you couldn’t do it, I’m going to force you to do it. If you want it enough, it can be done. He helped to make me who I am today.

Syrian spinach pie, Afghan savoury rice, Tibetan dumplings - just a few of the dishes that customers at six restaurants in Strasbourg tried during this week’s Refugee Food Festival.
Across Strasbourg, restaurant owners have thrown open their kitchens and invited chefs who have fled Syria, Afghanistan and Tibet to use their ovens and pots and serve their favourite dishes from their homeland to customers.
For the refugee chefs, it is a joyful chance to show off the culture they have left behind. Iman Rahal and her husband Mohammed from Damascus are two of the refugee chefs that joined the festival, and are happy to have the chance to “show that Syria is more than just war”, as Rahal puts it. “I want people to know that we have a great culture and wonderful food.”
The menu they come up with for the La Ruche aux Deux Reines, a Strasbourg restaurant that serves food from all over the world, is tantalisingly mouthwatering; fattoush (a salad with fried bread), fatayer (spinach and cheese pie), kibbeh (bulgur balls) and three delicious desserts. The reaction from customers has been overwhelming; “I had to disappoint about 60 customers,” restaurant owner Vicky Djama says. “There simply isn’t enough space for everybody.”
She loves the idea of the Refugee Food Festival and jumped at the chance to take part. “I see it as an honour,” she says. “I always wanted to know more about Syrian cuisine. But more importantly, we are all concerned about what’s happening in Syria, but we haven’t got a clue when it comes to doing something. For me this is a great opportunity to actually do something: help these refugees to show their talents to the public.”
The festival was the initiative of Parisians Marine Mandrila and Louis Martin, who run an organisation called Food Sweet Food that specialises in forming connections between people through culinary events, books and documentaries. 
“The festival has three objectives,” Marine says. ‘First of all, we want to change the way people look at refugees. There are all these negative assumptions. We want to show that they are people like you and me, who have skills and talents and can contribute to society. Secondly, we want to introduce unknown cuisines to the French public. And thirdly, we want to help these refugee chefs to integrate and increase their job opportunities.” The initiative has been supported by the UN refugee agency and the city of Strasbourg.
For Iman and Mohammed the festival is an important occasion to introduce themselves to the public. They set up a little Syrian catering service at home a while ago, but hope to begin a real restaurant and are looking for a financier. “A real restaurant is our dream,” says Iman. “But for now we just hope to make the people who come to the festival very happy.” 
She has just heard that her sister, who is still in Syria and has applied for asylum in France, has to wait another three months. “All of our family members are still in Syria, so it’s not going to be a very joyful Christmas for us,” says Mohammed, who used to be an architect and ran a large building company in Syria, but lost everything. 
A few blocks away, in an Italian restaurant, chef Massimo Solinas is working with Dorje, a Tibetan refugee who for safety reasons doesn’t want his last name mentioned. The Italian chef has discovered, to his surprise, that Tibetan cuisine has a dish similar to ravioli, called momo. So he is offering his guests a menu that combines Tibetan momos and Italian ravioli.
The flamboyant Italian and the quiet Tibetan make an unusual but successful team. The restaurant telephone hasn’t stopped ringing. “I have decided to organise another Tibetan evening in January,’ Solinas says.
The customers who have been able to get a table are full of praise. An elderly lady who has come with her husband and three grown children says: “We travelled to India this year where we were introduced to Tibetan food and we really loved it. That was one reason to come. But we are also impressed to eat food that’s cooked by someone who has gone through so much and still has found the strength to share his culture with us.”
“The festival offers us a rare opportunity to taste Tibetan food”, says a young man in the back of the restaurant, who came together with three friends. “We didn’t know what to expect, but we love it.”
“It’s the food from my village,” Dorje explains. “My mother taught me how to fold momos which really is an art in itself. She is a great cook and I can’t tell you how much I miss her. Making momos is a way for me to be with her.” He pauses. “What is so important to me is that this festival offers me the chance to show that we Tibetans have our own culture and cuisine, contrary to what the Chinese would like you to believe.”
“I’m a migrant, just like Dorje,” Solinas says. “That’s something that connects us. Although our reasons were different, we both left our country. So we both know what it is when you live in one country and all of your family lives somewhere else.”
In yet another kitchen in the city, Afghan chef Ahmadzai is working hard in the Vietnamese restaurant Mandala. The initial idea was that he would cook for only one evening but the event attracted so much attention that restaurant owner Frédéric Muller asked him back. The dishes Mandala is serving tonight are a fusion of Asian and Afghan elements. 
Ahmadzai is afraid to talk to the press, so Frédéric does the talking. “For me it’s a natural thing to partake in the festival because my wife is Vietnamese and her parents came to France as refugees. Through them I have seen how difficult it is to find your place in a totally alien country.”
Working with Ahmadzai is easy, he says, because the Afghan had already gained experience in a Vietnamese restaurant in Norway. “Refugees can enrich our society, but in the media they are depicted as an invasion. I really want to contradict that lie.”
Asked why the festival attracts so many people, his wife Nicole To says: “People are curious. They want to try out food they have never tasted before. But I also think many people are genuinely concerned about the fate of refugees. And this is a way to show it.”
Later that evening Ahmadzai introduces himself to the customers with a short speech. “I really want to express my gratitude that you have come to eat my food,” he says. And when the guests give him a loud applause, he smiles.
The Refugee Food Festival is in Strasbourg until December 23. This month Food Sweet Food is launching a practical toolkit for people who want to organise a refugee food festival in their own city. For more information email contact@foodsweetfood.org
In June next year Food Sweet Food is planning a European Refugee Food Festival across 10 European cities.
When John Tereska’s Trump-voting family members open their gifts from him on Christmas Day, they will get a shock.
Inside pretty boxes they’ll find notes thanking them for making donations to organizations like Planned Parenthood and the Sierra Club that support causes expected to come under attack from the new administration.
“With my oldest brother, who I know voted for Trump, I’m going right for the jugular. I’m donating to the Democratic National Committee on his behalf,” Tereska said.
Tereska, an avid Hillary Clinton supporter, is so mad at the relatives who voted for Donald Trump in November that he’s giving money to progressive not-for-profit organizations in their names, in lieu of Christmas presents this year.
Many devastated Democrats have decided the best way to make a point to their loved ones with polar political views this holiday season is to put their money where they wish their relatives’ mouth were.
Ken Urban, a playwright who teaches part time at Princeton University and voted Democratic, has made donations to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) on behalf of his parents as their Christmas gifts.
“My father was the Republican mayor of my small home town in New Jersey and spent his career in the navy reserve. My mother told me she would never vote for Hillary Clinton because they have a friend who works for the CIA who said she was ‘difficult’. And there are aunts and uncles and cousins in my family who voted for Trump,” said Urban.
He is ruing the fact that he and his boyfriend agreed, before the election, to attend a big family Christmas gathering for the first time in 20 years.
But the SPLC donations on behalf of his parents will take the sting out of it.
“I thought I could make a point and in the process be generous to a human rights cause that is only going to become more important now,” said Urban.
Some were inspired after hearing about donations to Planned Parenthood made in the name of Vice-President elect Mike Pence, who is fiercely against abortion. Pence is sent an acknowledgment from the family planning organization for every contribution.
Randi Greenwald, a retired lawyer in Portland, Maine, heard about the Pence idea and decided to put a more personal, local spin on the tactic.
Her son’s brother-in-law is Canadian but is a big fan of Trump and has been taunting the rest of the Democratic-leaning family ever since the real estate tycoon’s surprise win in November, she said.
“It meant more to me to make a revenge donation in this person’s name to a small cause locally,” she said.
Greenwald gave the money to her state branch of the Immigration Legal Advocacy Project, ILAP Maine, which assists people with their immigration cases, including asylum seekers and refugees.
“That’s his holiday gift this year,” she said. She’s bought regular presents for other members of the family.
Her Democratic-voting relatives are highly amused at the thought of him receiving a thank you letter from ILAP, she said.
“For me, if I don’t laugh, I’m going to cry,” she said.
Francie Schnipke, who works for a not-for-profit group in Chicago, is also supporting the SPLC – in the name of her Trump-voting older brother in rural Ohio.
He went from being a non-voter to a vocal Trump fan, despite the fact that their mother is Mexican and they have a family member with special needs, she said; they belong to two groups among many denigrated by Trump during the campaign.
She thinks the brother was swept along by the rhetoric of co-workers at his transportation company.
“He’s always been a loving brother and father. I’m reeling,” she said. “I think he was emboldened by the idea of the outsider coming to fix dysfunctional Washington.”
Now Schnipke hopes the information leaflets the SPLC will send her brother will “give him pause”, she said.
Tereska, an operations analyst for a fashion retailer in New York, isn’t only giving “revenge donations”. His sister voted for Clinton, so she is getting a “love donation” to the Human Rights Campaign for LGBT equality.
But the majority of his family members will get gifts that he thinks they’ll perceive as hostile.
“My father wrote in John McCain on his ballot, so I take that as a vote for Trump. My mother will not talk about it, so I assume she voted for Trump. They are getting donations to Planned Parenthood,” Tereska said.
“I’m still grappling with the result of the election and this is my small slice of revenge for the fact that their votes have just jeopardized me and the entire world for the next four years.”
Our family home in Shimoda, in Japan’s Shizuoka prefecture, was built by an American, so it looked western from the outside. But inside it was typically Japanese.
We didn’t have chairs, so when I was younger I dreamed of being able to live in a western house, to sit on a chair and drink coffee or to eat a baguette off a white plate. We always sat in a tatami-mat room right next to the kitchen.
My husband’s parents had an ultra‑ modern home – his father was an English teacher and his mother liked candles and wore perfume. It was a great contrast to the understated environment I grew up in. They also ate western-style food.
In our home, we usually ate traditional Japanese meals of rice, vegetables and fish, and only a little meat. We lived near the sea, so we also ate a lot of horse mackerel and kinmedai (golden-eye sea bream), usually raw as sashimi.
We often ate a seaweed dish called hijiki, plus lots of simmered dishes using kiriboshi daikon (dried daikon radish, which is rehydrated when used in cooking) and other dried goods. My mother was adept at using those in her cooking. She put sesame seeds into miso soup, spinach, cabbage, hijiki … just about everything. I remember her sitting on the kitchen floor with a pestle and mortar, grinding the seeds into a paste. She did it so often that, over time, the mortar made a dent in the doorframe.
Those days were the origins of the cookery I do now – a mixture of Japanese influences from home and western touches I learned after I met my husband.
I started cooking for my mother and father when I was at senior high school. I cooked for them a lot until I got married when I was 26. My father loved to drink sake, so we always made him small dishes that pair well with it, like mackerel in miso or chopped raw horse mackerel.
The dish that reminds me of him most, however, is fried chicken with leek sauce. I came up with it to make him happy, but it has become a favourite dish among my readers, too. It’s not quite a Chinese dish, but it’s not really Japanese either.
My father was so amazed by the taste and used to say: “This is the best chicken I have ever had.” In fact, he wasn’t that keen on chicken – so it’s a testament to how much he liked this recipe. Anyone can make it: all you need is a few easy-to-come-by seasonings, some chicken – frozen will do – and a single leek.
When I became known for my cooking, I travelled a lot. I was always busy, so my parents couldn’t see me whenever they wanted. In that respect, I think they were a little sad about my success.
1 Pierce the chicken all over with a fork so it will better absorb the seasoning. Mix the soy sauce with the sake, then pour this over the chicken, making sure it seeps well into the meat. Set aside while you prepare the leek sauce.
2 To make the leek sauce, combine the soy, vinegar, sake and sugar in a bowl. In a pan, lightly fry the chopped leek in some heated oil, then pour in the soy sauce mixture and chopped red chilli and stir together until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat and set aside.
3 Coat the chicken with the potato starch, then deep-fry in oil at 180C/350F. For crispier chicken, raise it out of the oil from time to time. When fried to a golden brown, cut the chicken into bite-size pieces. Serve dressed with the leek sauce. I sometimes accompany this with some lettuce.
This year, without consulting me, my wife sent an email to both of our families, explaining that we didn’t want presents for Hannukah, and were not going to buy them either. Instead, she made a generous donation to Doctors Without Borders on behalf of our extended family. It was the type of selfless act my wife regularly does, and one of the reasons I love her deeply. Yet my first reaction was to read the email and think: “Wait a minute … I like presents!”.
I feel her pain. At this time of the year, the front of our house is a loading dock, where random gifts and goods are deposited by deliverymen daily. As an avowed advocate of analog goods, our living room teems with toppling piles of books and magazines, records, photographs and board games that I stockpile for winter, like a greedy little squirrel.
In the layer cake of our household crap, my stuff is merely the icing. The substance of our clutter is a plastic carpeting of our daughter’s toys (largely of the Disney princess variety), which, like Houdini, cannot be restrained by any form of containment. They burst forth from their appointed cupboards and boxes to bring unicorn joy to every corner of the home, mysteriously covering all dark fabrics in a thin veneer of glitter, like it’s Sunday morning at some awful disco.
Her four-month-old brother brings his own brand of consumption overload, in the form of of scattered toe crushing bouncy chairs and bright squeaky things that we have yet to write thank you notes for. And blankets. Countless barf-covered blankets.
And so, when the doorbell rings and a newly-wrapped present passes the threshold, my wife rolls her eyes at the latest addition to this cornucopia of tchochkes, and mourns once more that Marie Kondo dream of a sparse, perfectly joyful house.
A few years ago, as the online economy took off, a lot of gift-giving shifted to the intangible. People wanted to simultaneously fulfill our desire to give and receive, but without all that stuff. My birthday came and I wasn’t sent envelopes or boxes, but emails with gift credit to iTunes, a membership to a music streaming service and plenty of what people once called E-Cards.
But something was missing: the material joy of actual presents.
Presents aren’t supposed to be easy. The effort required to think about and procure them can be arduous. It requires knowledge of both the market and the target, and relies on the strength of your own taste and the relationship with the recipient. But I draw great pleasure from the challenge.
Each gift is something I obsess over, as a tangible test of my relationship. The hunt is a gauntlet to run, but it’s half the fun. Sweating in a down jacket, wool hat and slush-covered boots in a bookstore, or, god forbid, shopping mall, searching for the things to tick off my list ... this is a test of the relationship at the core of the exchange.
Sure, I can effortlessly order the same thing online, maybe even for cheaper, but this challenge brings me out onto the streets. It forces me to get face to face with the holiday season, to wrestle down its schmaltzy optimism and even embrace it, finding some joy in the lights, the shop windows and the blast of Mariah Carey’s voice that will not stop chasing me, no matter what store I enter.
I also love the stakes of giving a real gift. When you email someone a present, the reaction is strictly textual, and largely neutral, like wishing someone “HBD” on Facebook, instead of calling them on their birthday. But when you present someone with a box, or an envelope, you enter a game, where every facial expression holds the potential of failure or success.
The best moment is the very second someone takes a gift in their hand, and holds it for that brief, respectful second. It’s a moment full of pregnant wonder, when the wrapping could hide just about anything, and there’s a slight temptation to just leave it intact, in case reality ruins that hope.
But they do tear it open. We all do. Because while presents are cluttering, and wasteful, and largely destined to go back to the same store for a credit (or the thrift shop), they also embody something so irresistible about the human experience, that cannot be replicated virtually.
Gifts are one of the few symbols of love –that most ephemeral of feelings– that we can lay our hands on and pass on to others. They are tangible totems of something that gives us pleasure, and make us feel loved, and meaningful, no matter how irrational or selfish that sounds.
Please give to charity, do good works, and don’t clog the world with more stuff. But then be sure to give those who matter a little something they can hold. It means a lot to them, and to you.
Christmas is hereditary; you get it from your parents. When I was growing up, Christmas meant getting to open one present after midnight mass and having to wait until after morning service for the rest. It meant hoping that no one would decide they wanted to talk to the vicar – my mother – after church, further delaying both presents and food. On some occasions, it meant an extra guest round the table and not being able to open your presents until they had left – those were the worst Christmases.
It also meant anything other than turkey, which my mother saw as an unnecessary faff alongside everything. But as far as my partner is concerned, Christmas means turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce. Fortunately, Delia is on hand to help this year – the first time we are hosting Christmas – with an hour-by-hour guide to the final 36 hours of the perfect festive dinner.
I start with the stuffing. Now, there are some ingredients that always fill me with dread, and stale bread is one. Happening to have bread that is neither fresh nor furry feels like a level of preparation that I have yet to manage. Having eaten the last of the bread for breakfast, I head to the shops and use a fresh slice, with no noticeable problems. Delia’s recipe for stuffing is easy – make breadcrumbs in your processor, add the sage and onion, then take it all out and mix it with the sausage meat. And there you have your stuffing, which you can bung into the fridge until you need it.
Delia recommends that you make the cranberry sauce the night before, but it keeps well for about a fortnight, so you can make it whenever. It’s simplicity itself – just cranberries, sugar and port in a pan and hey presto!
Not so simple is the turkey. Delia’s recipe provides an hour-by-hour breakdown of exactly how to cook your turkey. It is when I see that the first time on Delia’s timetable is 7.45am that my heart sinks. I’m aware that, at this point, anyone with a child under 10 will have broken into mirthless laughter at the idea that a 7.45am start on Christmas morning is excessively early. I know this because I made the mistake of complaining about the early start to my mother. No power on Earth could move me to start cooking lunch if I have to face outer screaming from small children. The whole thing is stressful enough when all I have to drown is my own inner screaming.
According to Delia, the important thing is to get both turkey and stuffing to room temperature by leaving both in a cool, dry place, which, considering the size of our flat and the turkey, is trickier than it sounds. Even getting it in the fridge requires a wholesale reordering of the interior to accommodate the thing. After much fretting, I leave it, covered over, in the bathroom. At the time of writing, none of my guests have keeled over, so I’m going to say it has been a success.
I preheat the oven, then stuff the turkey. Then, as per Delia’s instructions, I start peeling the potatoes ready for roasting, before leaving them in a pan, just covered in water, to boil later. “At this point, everything should be under control,” Delia writes, “so you can take time out of the kitchen to help the kids unwrap their presents, have a coffee or tidy the house.” I must admit that if, having got up at horrible o’clock, stuffed a turkey and peeled potatoes, my partner expected me to tidy the house, I would consult a divorce lawyer. Happily, the matter doesn’t arise, so, reasoning that it’s Christmas, I help myself to a drink.
“Pop the plates into the warming oven,” Delia writes. Not for the first time, I contemplate the gulf between the kitchen in my flat and the kitchen that Delia thinks I have. The turkey is so large that there is barely room for it and the roast potatoes in the bottom oven, so Delia’s all-in-one baked vegetables (of which, more below) are going in the top oven – which, to be honest, I’m not 100% certain is in working order. My partner, with the confidence of a woman who hasn’t used the oven since David Cameron was prime minister, assures me that it does work. I hope she’s right and help myself to another drink. Still, I reason that anyone who complains about cold plates can leave the flat via the balcony – and I elect not to warm my plates.
I spend the next hour fretting about whether the top oven works, and helping myself to increasingly larger glasses of port as our guests arrive. The more cunning of them ask if they can help out at all, while the more transparent ones content themselves with asking flatly what it is they have to do to be namechecked in the Guardian.
I take the turkey out to rest and whack the potatoes in the oven, before turning to the all-in-one baked vegetables. This is one of Delia’s clever tricks to avoid having to put the vegetables on the hob at that critical juncture when everything else – turkey, roast potatoes, sprouts – need to be either taken out of the oven, basted, parboiled or in some way interfered with. In other words, it saves on hob space. Simply add a little vinaigrette, salt and pepper, cover the vegetables in foil, bung them in the oven at the time you take the turkey out, and they’ll be ready when you take the potatoes out of the oven.
That done, all that’s left is to saute your chestnuts for the brussels sprouts. This is a recipe where instead of using one item of cookware for your sprouts, you first parboil them in one pan before sautéing them in another with chestnuts and shallots.
I spend the meal beaming every time someone says something nice about the turkey, fretting about whether I remembered to put all those pans in to soak, and hoping that someone will notice I have done something special to the sprouts.
No-one does. So there you are, folks: that’s what you’d have had to do get a shout-out in these pages. Still, a very happy Christmas – it wouldn’t have been half as fun without you.
When your family get together at Christmas, do you find yourself feeling as though you are re-experiencing childhood dramas? Do you feel you’re taking on a role, reverting to Christmas past? You may even feel as though you are reading from an invisible script and repeating interactions with family members that leave you feeling frustrated and angry.
We may consider ourselves to be autonomous adults who have carved out our own independent lives. But when the holidays loom, many find themselves dreading predictably damaging and repetitious scenarios with family. These unnerving interactions often include put-downs, competitiveness, control freakery and passive aggression.
Lots of us have a family member whom we find particularly goading and who pushes all the right buttons to zone right in on our most vulnerable responses. Although we promise ourselves (and others) that this year we will be different and we will not become entangled in an argument we cannot win, we still find ourselves drawn into the same old scenarios with the usual suspects, and responding to them in familiar, ineffective ways.
Christmas can be a time when we find ourselves particularly locked in a role that we thought we had discarded long ago. In my case, I grew up in a family in which “emotional perfectionism” – being upbeat and positive – was obligatory and served as an effective camouflage to distract from our father’s severe winter depressions.
If this sounds familiar, sit down and write out an example of a scenario that you experienced last year, noting what the situation was, what your family member said and how you responded. Then note how this made you feel. You may find this exercise surprisingly easy because the same scenarios tend to have been repeated since childhood. That is because we know our script, and that of our relatives, all too well.
How can we change these scripts, without upsetting others? Re-writing can be extremely helpful, and can turn a challenging get-together into a much more enjoyable one. Yet we often hold ourselves back because we feel that certain behaviour is expected of us by others. We don’t want to rock the boat at a big family occasion. But often our worries about this are exaggerated, and you may find that, by making a few changes in your personal script, you can experience a greater sense of control over these upsetting encounters. The following tips might help:
If your family member always pushes your buttons about your health, your life choices or your children, consider alternative ways of responding, and mentally rehearse your new lines of response before your relative arrives.
Another person will probably have witnessed these scenarios many times, and the distress that they cause you. Discuss your concerns about the upcoming holiday, and see if they have ideas or solutions that might be helpful. They could even keep an eye out during the holidays to make sure you feel supported when you are trying out new ways of dealing with troublesome family.
Remember that you don’t have to tolerate abuse or belittling comments from family members. Just because they’ve succeeded in making you feel bad for decades doesn’t mean this pattern has to continue forever. Try not to rise to their bait. Leave the room and get some fresh air if you are feeling trapped by them.
Our adrenaline can build up when we are dreading these encounters and can often cause us to shake, or waver in our resolve to handle things differently. Start practising controlled breathing and mindfulness exercises before the guests arrive, and talk to yourself like a supportive coach. Thinking “I can handle this” is much more helpful than a constant cycle of worry and “Oh no, here we go again …”
Holidays are stressful enough without finding ourselves caught in the trap of replicating outdated family dynamics and negative interactions. A bit of preparation, self-calming, and alternative strategies are a way of rescuing yourself from tedious, but undermining, family roles.
Stefano Gajani Billi, a 55-year-old Roman with roots in the northern Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, has been eating homemade cappelletti for Christmas lunch for as long as he can remember.
The “little hats” of meat-filled pasta used to be made exclusively by Gajani Billi’s grandmother, but the tradition has since been taken over by Stefano himself, along with his mother, sister, wife and their children. Every December they convene for a cappelletti-making bonanza, where proceedings are dominated by two strict rules.
First, no shortcuts are tolerated. The filling requires at least five different meats, the pasta is made from scratch, and the broth in which the cappelletti will eventually be boiled has to be made from a capon, a castrated rooster.
Second, once the pasta dough has been folded over the filling, only Gajani Billi’s sister, Elena – the boss of the operation since the deaths of their grandmother and then father – is allowed to close the cappelletti, all 500 of them. The final twist must come from her well-trained fingers, she says, otherwise they may fall apart.
“It’s a family moment, in remembrance of my father and also my grandmother,” Gajani Billi says. “Also, it is the best thing you can eat in your life.”
Such Christmas meals are pillars of Italy’s rich culinary tradition. While the definition of a “typical” festive lunch varies from region to region, dishes such as cappelletti have been considered staples for centuries.
But that is changing. According to one Rome-based food writer, many labour-intensive Italian food traditions are dying off, especially in the south, largely because of economic factors that have led to the depopulation of villages and towns where the dishes used to be made.
“When people speak about food here nostalgically, they talk about their grannies. The mom might not be able to make those dishes, or she might just buy them. And the grandkids certainly don’t know how to make them,” says Katie Parla. “It’s not that people who are under 60 don’t cook, but they definitely don’t do it as intensively as they once did.”
The list of so-called endangered Italian foods – a topic on which Parla is now writing a book – is long and includes savoury dishes, sweets, and even digestifs and liquors.
Some of the most labour-intensive foods are broths, such as the one used to cook cappelletti on Christmas Day. Some broths require an assortment of meats, which are boiled in different pots so the liquid is a perfect blend of flavours.
Making the broth and then the bollito misto – mixed boiled meats that are served after the first dish – is a big job, Parla says, especially considering that a host would also be expected to prepare deep-fried vegetables for a Christmas antipasto.
Traditionally, that antipasto would include vegetables that were prepared in the summer and then preserved.
In the southern region of Molise, Parla has visited a town called Civita, where a special shortbread biscuit is made with a pasta frolla crust and a filling of flour, breadcrumbs, spices and red wine. What makes the biscuits unique is their elaborate decoration using a crimping tool. In one town, which now has just 400 residents, the only people left who make the biscuits are one baker and her daughter.
“When those women stop making those cookies, no one will be making them,” Parla says. “There they have an expression: ‘when she dies, the world dies’.”
But Parla, an American who has lived in Rome for many years, does not think the situation is hopeless. Her book will tackle what may be considered a sensitive topic in households trying to preserve traditions: is it OK to cut corners?
“In my opinion, it is one of the best ways of preserving a tradition,” Parla says. “Because if you trap a recipe in amber and require a huge number of steps, yes, it is beautiful if you can devote time and resource to it. But if you can’t, cutting corners means you are not eliminating it altogether, you are just evolving into another thing.”
In the case of Gajani Billi’s Christmas lunch, that could mean buying the cappelletti and focusing on making the broth. Or it could mean buying pasta dough instead of making it. “We can still evoke the importance of those recipes on certain days if we preserve them in a simplified way,” Parla says.
Ingredients: Fresh pasta dough (For 300 cappelletti, use 5 eggs and about a pound of flour)
1 To make the filling: in a pan of olive oil and rosemary, cook a turkey breast, 100g of mortadella, one pork chop, one sausage (casing removed), and guanciale (pork jowl). Blend the meats together and then mix in grated parmigiano reggiano and stracchino cheese. Also add 2-3 eggs and nutmeg. Refrigerate overnight.
2 Place a small dollop of the filling in the middle of a small circular piece of pasta dough. Fold the pasta in half and squeeze the sides of the pasta together. Bring the two edges of the pasta together and pinch them shut. Flip the cappelletto around and gently fold the sides down, so that it resembles a little hat.
3 For the broth: boil a capon. Remove the capon and then boil the cappelletti for about 20 minutes. Serve with the broth.
This tree’s jolly red berries and prickly leaves adorn every conceivable piece of Christmas paraphernalia, from napkins to wrapping paper. And yet one of the oft-asked questions when it comes to this tree in the garden is “why doesn’t my holly have any berries?” The plant family Ilex - of which the European holly Ilex aquifolium is a member - consists mostly of dioecious plants, meaning there are distinct male and female specimens, and only the female bears berries - and that’s provided there’s a male plant in the vicinity.
There are exceptions: I. aquifolium ‘Pyramidalis’ and ‘JC van Tol’ are both self-fertile, so they don’t need another plant for cross pollination and can produce berries all on their own. Their leaves are also much less spiny than regular I. aquifolium, which may or may not appeal. For more information on the vast range of hollies for gardens, check out this feature by Naomi Slade from the Guardian archive .
Non-festive fact: if you suffer from cats defecating on your seed beds, try laying some holly branches (preferably as spiny as possible - pyracantha is another option if you don’t have holly) across the bare soil. They won’t come near.
What is a Christmas tree, exactly? The term is a catchall for an awful lot of different species around the world. In New Zealand, a tree that features on many a Christmas card is Metrosideros excelsa, a member of the myrtle family known to Maori people as pohutukawa. Settlers, noting its habit of producing beautiful red bottlebrush flowers around Christmas time, dubbed it the New Zealand Christmas tree. It’s too tender to grow outside in the UK unless you happen to live in the Isles of Scilly. In San Francisco, on the other hand, it grows rather too well. Australia has the New South Wales Christmas bush, Ceratopetalum gummiferum: it too turns red in December, although the colour is the result of the sepals of the seed capsules, not the preceding flowers, which are white.
Back in Britain, the Christmas tree tradition, though it’s been going strong over several centuries, has embraced more than a dozen different trees. The needle-shedding Christmas tree of my youth, the Norway spruce (Picea abies), has gradually been elbowed out of British front rooms in favour of other trees that hang onto their foliage far longer - the Nordmann fir (Abies nordmanniana) leading the way, followed by the noble fir (Abies nobilis), the blue spruce (Picea pungens Glauca Group), and most recently the Fraser fir (Abies fraseri).
The origins of the practice of decorating a tree for Christmas are far from clear, but most agree it originates in central Europe, perhaps some time in the 1500s. Even in his 1850 short story The Christmas Tree, Charles Dickens refers to it as “that pretty German toy” (you can hear Simon Callow read this tale aloud here). If you want to read more about its history, I highly recommend the book Inventing the Christmas Tree by Bernd Brunner. For a different perspective, try palaeobotanist Susannah Lydon’s blogpost on the Christmas tree as a survivor from Mesozoic times.

As festive customs go, the yule log has fared far worse than the Christmas tree. In the dining hall of Hever Castle in Kent hangs the nineteenth century painting Yule Log by Robert Alexander Hillingford. A man and a boy use ropes to haul a hefty section of the trunk of an oak tree, preceded by a prancing spaniel. They are headed for a huge fireplace, where this giant log will be burn from Christmas Eve right through until Twelfth Night. And there’s the rub, for us in the 21st century, where such fireplaces are a relative rarity, replaced by modern contrivances such as radiators and underfloor heating.
But of course the yule log predates Christmas anyway, having its origins in pagan winter solstice celebrations that took place across Europe in many variations, where a tree or log (oak or ash in England, but different woods elsewhere - cherry in France, for instance), was burned to ward off evil spirits. There’s much more detail to delve into on regional variations of the yule log tradition in Chambers’ Book of Days.
Today, you’re much more likely to be enjoying the chocolate replica, or if you are in the US, watching the now-traditional TV broadcast of a burning yule log. If you fancy making your very own a chocolate yule log, here’s the perfect recipe.
Boswellia may not be a familiar treename to you, but you will know the fragrant gum resin drawn from the trees of this genus from its key role in Christmas carols and nativity plays. Frankincense was one of the gifts bought by the three kings to the infant Jesus, according to the book of Matthew in the Bible.
My favourite Frankincense fact is that the Egyptians called it “sweat of the gods fallen to earth”. In fact it was highly valued by several cultures in ancient times, including the Romans, the Greeks and the Babylonians. For a full account of its uses, visit Marquette University’s Historians@Work blog.
Frankincense is still prized today, as an ingredient for making incense, for cosmetics, perfumes and so on. The boswellia tree still grows wild Oman, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Yemen, and it is harvested in the same way as ancient times: the bark is cut and the resin that exudes is collected. Unfortunately Boswellia sacra is classed as near-threatened on the IUCN red list of endangered species. If you would like to see one of these trees in the flesh, there is a specimen of B. sacra growing in the Princess of Wales conservatory at Kew Gardens in London.
Myrhh is the product of another family of trees, Commiphora, that grow in the same part of the world as Boswellia. It’s another gum resin that is used for just the same purposes as frankincense: incense, perfumes, medicines and the like. In fact both trees are members of the Burseraceae or incense tree family.
Read the verse about myrhh in the carol We Three Kings of Orient Are and the role of this “bitter perfume” as a symbol of death is clear: Jesus’s body was embalmed with pounds of it, according to the account in John 19 (myrhh means “bitter” in Arabic). Like Boswellia, Commiphora is a shrubby desert tree: it is adapted to the harsh conditions with spines to discourage grazing animals. If you fancy trying to grow your own myrhh tree, you can buy a young Commiphora myrrha seedling from The Curious Plant Company in the UK, but bear in mind you will need to grow it as a houseplant so you’re unlikely to be harvesting resin from it.
 The trees came first – five ancient oaks amid which this trinity of pods in Beaminster, Dorset, has arisen in homage. When it rains the stainless steel gutters water said trees. Less fortunate oaks were sacrificed to construct the cladding, floors and the decked areas that wrap round each pod and extend the main rooms into the garden when the glass doors are open.

Nativity scenes are the art we see at Christmas, often on cards that put a masterpiece on the mantelpiece. Baby it’s cold outside, so let’s warm our hearts with a bit of Piero della Francesca or Bruegel.
Yet we close our eyes to the reality of this art. We turn Renaissance and baroque paintings into empty kitsch when we appropriate them as part of modern Christmas celebrations, which in truth have little in common with the much more religious world that created these images.
Look a bit harder and the great paintings of the nativity story that we sentimentalise at Christmas are full of death and decay. Some are are literally apocalyptic. Far from soppy, painted equivalents of a modern school nativity play, these paintings are premonitory visions of suffering that invite the most serious of meditations.
The world is ending. It is in ruins. A civilisation is collapsing around us. That is the setting of Leonardo da Vinci’s Adoration of the Magi and many more depictions of the infancy of Christ. In Leonardo’s unfinished Adoration, the enigmatic ruins of wondrous buildings stand behind Mary and her child. Staircases lead to nowhere. Trees grow out of the crumbling structure. These ruins represent the decay of the classical pagan world. With Christ’s coming, the pagan age is over; its achievements – which Renaissance artists revered – must all fall into ruin. Leonardo goes further. He also depicts a distant cavalry battle to suggest the violence of history from which Christ has come to promise deliverance.
Other paintings show the ruins of Rome in a way that is eerie and bleak, suggesting that as well as hope, the nativity also brings a painful ending of old ways. As TS Eliot puts it in his poem Journey of the Magi, “this Birth was hard and bitter agony for us, like Death, our death”.
Eliot’s great, uneasy poem, about the pain as well as hope the Magi feel in seeing a revelation that leaves them uncomfortable in the “old dispensation”, is very close to the true spirit of Renaissance paintings. In Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s harsh portrayal of the three kings, they are exhausted old men, withered stumps of time, their myopic and senile faces unable to truly understand what they have seen.
Their gifts are troubling. Myrrh was used for embalming – it prefigures Christ’s death. Even without that clue, the fact that Christ has been born to suffer for human sins is not hard to see. In Leonardo’s Adoration, he reaches out to accept a gift as if accepting his fate. Part of the reason this painting is so potent as an unfinished work is that the uncoloured shadows evoke mortal thoughts.
Yet we don’t just ignore dark hints in paintings of the nativity – at Christmas we glide completely over a part of the story that artists in the past portrayed with the same insight they brought to the stable scene. You won’t find the Massacre of the Innocents on any Christmas cards, but it was painted as acutely as any nativity image by Bruegel, Rubens or Poussin.
Herod’s massacre of the firstborn does not fit our heartwarming image of Christmas. Unfortunately nor do nativity scenes, if we look at them with both eyes open. Caravaggio’s Adoration of the Shepherds includes a brilliant still life of a set of carpenter’s tools in the foreground. Is this just a nice allusion to Joseph’s job as a carpenter? Of course not. It is also a forewarning that one day such tools will be used to build a cross for Christ to die on.
The seriousness of this birth is such that some artists simply shun cuddly domestic detail and portray it in an utterly sombre way as a moment of revelation. Piero della Francesca’s Nativity portrays Mary not nursing her child but kneeling on the earth to pray to and for him. The shepherds keep a respectful distance in front of a stable so humble and broken down that it places this mystical moment outside all human comfort. Only a choir of angels brings a silent music of joy.
Sandro Botticelli goes even further. His Mystic Nativity sees the holy birth not in cute human terms but as the event that ultimately foretells the Last Judgment, the end of days and the coming of a new heaven and a new earth. Devils flee into hell as angels soar aloft.
Of course Renaissance and baroque artists find joy and hope in the nativity. Angels rejoice, dumb animals recognise the weight of this moment, and all eyes are on the child who will redeem the world. It doesn’t have much in common with the festive fun of our modern, highly secularised and commercial Christmas. These paintings are about death and resurrection and the shock of revelation. That nativity scene on a card is an opportunity for a moment of meditation amid the tinsel. More Silent Night than Jingle Bells.
 Actually-quite-nice, non-garish Christmas jumpers are possible: think vaguely geometric graphics, muted earth tones and boxier knits. You could wear them beyond the festive period, even. Ideal for hiding the handsome ‘turkey baby’ you’ve acquired over Christmas, which is always a bonus.
Each Christmas, I place a stack of books on my bedside table, planning to read my way through the lot during my week off. And each Christmas, without fail, they remain precisely where I put them as I turn to old favourites instead: Dickens, Christie, Streatfeild, Rowling, Lewis. Christmas, after all, is a time for tradition. An unfamiliar book, like a new film or an untested recipe, has little place on my Christmas Day.
From childhood, this has been my favourite time of year. Although I grew up in Australia, where Christmas Day regularly reaches 30 degrees, I relished stories where the characters are surrounded by snow, warming their hands by the fire. I have great affection for the platters of prawns, fruit-topped pavlovas and glorious sunshine I remember from my childhood Christmases – but it never felt like anything I saw in my favourite books.
Once I moved to England, much of the comfort and familiarity in the Christmases I have spent here comes from my books; on my bedside table, and in my kitchen. Here, the roast bird, the flaming plum pudding and the pastel-hued sweets so often found in stories make complete sense.
Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders. “There is your hat, then, and there your bird,” said he. “By the way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.” The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle by Arthur Conan Doyle
Roasted goose was the Christmas bird of choice for most middle-class families in Victorian England and this is reflected in literature: the plot of Conan Doyle’s The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle hangs on a Christmas goose, and Dickens’s Cratchit family in A Christmas Carol eke one out with mashed potato and stuffing.
Though turkey was financially out of reach for most English families until the mid-20th century, the bird has long been associated with Christmas. Henry VIII is rumoured to have placed one on his Christmas table, and Edward VII made it a fashionable choice for the wealthy in the early years of last century. It also plays an important role in A Christmas Carol: Ebenezer Scrooge’s fowl gift to Bob and his family on Christmas Day is indicative of his newfound generosity.
This moment in fiction has had a lasting legacy; around 75% of us will have turkey this year, a truly staggering figure (especially if you share my opinion that a humble roast chicken is a vastly superior bird). Modern fiction continues to reflect this – think of the turkey curry buffet in Bridget Jones’s Diary (a little better than Bridget’s blue soup).
My great-grandmother spent long days each August boiling puddings in calico, and hanging them all over her house to dry. It’s a tradition the rest of our family has adopted. We’re in good company; the plum pudding has its origins in medieval England, and is still a common feature on Christmas tables across the country. I have lost count of the number of fictional families who finish their Christmas dinner with a pudding: the dessert is carried out by Percy in Lucy M Boston’s The Children of Green Knowe, enjoyed by the Fossil sisters in Noel Streatfeild’s Ballet Shoes, and appears in the Great Hall at the end of Harry’s first Christmas in Hogwarts.
Nothing feels more like Christmas to me than dishes, tins and bowls of sweets, placed at intervals around the house. At no other time of year does every retreat to the sofa involve a couple of Quality Street or mini Daim bars. If I am feeling slightly more ambitious, I’ll make the sweets that I read about: crystallised ginger from Agatha Christie’s The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding, sugar plums from A Visit from St Nicholas by Clement Clarke Moore, and soft pink cubes of Turkish Delight in CS Lewis’s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Now, I can’t spend Christmas in Narnia with the Pevensie children, or solving crimes with Hercule Poirot – but it reassures me to see them similarly taken with decadent sweets.
Food serves many functions in literature, providing us with a strong sense of time and place. From my years of reading about it, I felt I understood Christmas in England long before I ever experienced it. Moving to the UK was not unlike stepping through the wardrobe into Narnia; leaving the comfort of the familiar for the relative unknown. I spent much of my first year finding my feet. But that first Christmas, I lived the day that I had spent so many years dreaming about – and ate the meals I had spent so many years reading about.
We’ve been on the long, slow, slide to Christmas since Halloween’s ghosts and skeletons packed up their sheets and bones for another year.

Garden centres go through a metamorphosis at this time of year. Over a series of weeks, everything changes: shovels are pushed toward the margins of the store, bags of composts hide themselves in corners, and the few real plants that are left get lined up near a back fence, like mutinous soldiers waiting for a firing squad. The space is then filled with dancing Santas and scented candles. There are both real and imitation trees in mindboggling varieties; from fresh-cut Norway spruces to fibre optic trees which change colour and freakishly rotate. There are ornaments and flashing lights and roasting tins for a turkey dinner. Yesterday I stood, in a kind of hypnotic trance, watching a plastic reindeer sing Jingle Bells. I couldn’t take my eyes off it. In short, during Christmas, our garden centres rarely feel like garden centres. However, if you’re a plantoholic like myself, don’t despair, because now is the perfect time to buy bare-root plants.
Bare-root plants are plants which have been, unlike their container-grown cousins, grown in open ground. In the winter time, when the plants go dormant, nurseries dig them up and package them ready for transplant. Some nurseries will simply send you the roots and stems wrapped in plastic or burlap. Other nurseries pot up the plant, as the soil helps to keep the roots in better condition. Either way, you are buying the skeleton of the plant – the structural bits which really matter.
The problem with buying bare-root is that plants are obviously less exciting in their dormant state. Buying plants in December is like going on a date with someone who is wearing their dressing gown and slippers; you need to be able to see the potential. And this is where the internet and catalogues become a wonderful way to shop for plants. Online you can look at pictures of plants in their prime. In catalogues you can gape at glossy images of perennials in full flower, or lust after photos of delicious strawberries ripe for the picking. Wintertime, with its short days and long nights, is a time for dreaming. I recently ordered two rambling roses with the purpose of covering an unsightly fence. Online I could look at pictures of ramblers running over archways and trellises, bursting in creams and pinks in their midsummer glory. I could scroll through pages of choices and look at detailed descriptions of each plant. I could do the thing that all gardeners do best over the winter months – I could imagine.
Besides the fun of buying, there are a number of practical benefits when you order your plants bare-root. Often they’re cheaper. It takes a nursery far more time and effort to look after pot-grown plants then to dig a plant up from a field. In addition, when ordering plants you aren’t paying a courier to deliver a heavy pot of compost. Then there’s the fact that when you order bare-root plants you often have a much greater selection to pick from. Online or in catalogues, you can more easily shop around and come to an informed decision, instead of making an impulse purchase because a plant in full bloom batted its eyelashes at you. This all means that you’re more likely to choose, as they say, the right plant for the right place. Finally, bare-root plants are often easier to plant and, once established, grow more vigorously than their container grown counterparts. When you plant a bare-root specimen the roots spread out in every direction in a natural fibrous network. This is in stark contrast to container grown roots which circle around themselves in an ever tightening fist. A plant grown in a pot has also had to deal with extreme fluctuations in temperature and irregular watering, while a plant grown in an open field has grown steadily and strongly.
The downside of bare-root plants is their appearance. When your plants arrive you are often left looking at little more than a handful of twigs. Bare-root plants need to be put in the ground as soon as possible. Once removed from the soil, the danger is that the roots dry out and die. Dig a hole large enough to accommodate the entire root system, and make sure that the roots are covered with at least half an inch of soil. If you are not able to plant out, then pot up your plants in an appropriate sized container and remember to keep the roots damp, but not waterlogged. Remember, when planting bare-root time is of the essence.
Depending on what you’re after, there are hundreds of nurseries online and catalogues which supply plants bare-root. Some nurseries specialise in trees or hedging; in Britain we are spoiled for choice when it comes to the number to nurseries which offer bare-root plants. Crocus has a good selection of roses, and Unwins has numerous perennials to choose from. If you want a few new fruit trees, Marshalls is a good place to start. Toby Buckland’s nursery also specialises in bare root plants. Looking to establish a new hedge? Then bare-root is definitely the way to go; have a look at Hedge Nursery to for inspiration. You have a world of bare-root options at your fingertips.
As for me, my bare-root roses have recently arrived. The handful of uninspired stems I now possess is far from exciting. However, buying bare-root is all about buying a plant’s potential. Gardeners, more than most, have a great capacity for optimism. We always think that next year the garden will be better than the last. The great thing about watching a garden mature is that we’re rarely wrong. My new roses are already in the ground, their roots growing and readying the plant for spring. I can’t wait to see them grow and bloom. In the meantime, I have another issue to deal with; I need to find a place for a singing reindeer.
When I decided to fund a TV commercial on Christmas Day, I didn’t realise it would lead to the start of a campaign to ask large businesses to change their approach to charitable giving and support small charities.
Here’s how that came about.
After I was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia, which left me in need of a gruelling stem cell transplant, I spent the best part of 2014 in hospital. While there I benefitted from the amazing work that charities do, so when I left hospital I wanted to give something back.
I not only wanted to give the gift of funding but of awareness. I settled on a Christmas Day TV advert to highlight the work of a specific charity, as well as advertising on product packs. But when I approached some of the UK’s leading charities, I was shocked to be made to feel as if I had to prove myself and my brand to earn their approbation. Sadly I was too small for them, and they were too big to care.
The experience made me look beyond these big, well-known charities to the smaller ones doing extraordinary work on a shoestring. They are overlooked when it comes to big corporate giving but their work is just as important, if not more so. I vowed then and there to do something to help.
I have written and directed a two-minute TV commercial (with no mention of the products I sell) and have secured a prime time spot on Channel 4 on Christmas Day, timed to air just after the Queen’s Christmas broadcast. This is the advert I wantto use to shine a light on these small-time heroes.
I approached a small, Tetbury-based national charity called Hope For Tomorrow, which works tirelessly to provide mobile chemotherapy units to local NHS Trusts so patients don’t have to travel for hours for treatment. The charity leapt at the chance to work with me because such opportunities to raise awareness of their work don’t come their way often, and I was thrilled to be involved with such a great cause.
But I was shocked by the huge gap between big and small organisations in the charity sector. The larger charities get the lion’s share of corporate giving, leaving the smaller ones scrabbling for scraps.
This is a flaw in the charity sector, and much of the problem comes from an unbalanced relationship with business. Large organisations mainly work with large charities that already have a global level of awareness. It’s almost as though businesses are glory hunting when it comes to charity partnerships, to the detriment of smaller charities.
I have launched a campaign calling for large corporations to support small charities and shout about the ones they are already supporting. So whatever your cause, please sign my pledge and help to make a change this Christmas.
I have also dedicated a page on my Black Farmer website to help businesses and small charities find each other. As businesses, it’s important to show that we care for bigger things than just the products we sell.

Three months after Mum died, it was really important that we observe her Christmas traditions. As part of a non-Christian, immigrant family, I found Christmas tense as a child. You built up a set of cards from classmates that went unreciprocated; your parents grumbled at having to buy gifts for teachers paid to educate us; presents were a waste of money. And Diwali was always referred to as “Indian Christmas”.
But we had our traditions, and Mum made us observe them. From my uncle staying over then driving to his house to shower (and us waiting for him in order for the festivities to start) to my best friend, Junaid, coming over for the meal and games, and phoning my ba (grandmother) and bapuji (grandfather) to say to them in a problematic Indian accent: “Merry Christmas.” The best, though, was Mum’s roast tandoori Christmas chicken. She made it once a year, and it was, without fail, delicious.
On our wedding day my wife and I were presented with a book of recipes crowdsourced from our families. Pride of place was the recipe for Mum’s roast tandoori Christmas chicken, written in her handwriting. It’s the item I’d run back into a burning house to rescue. There’s something powerful about seeing her handwriting.
The year she died, I took the recipe back to our childhood home so we could prepare for Christmas. My sister, wife and I were going to make the roast tandoori Christmas chicken, and in that first taste my sister and I would be transported back to Mum’s kitchen, with the sound of sizzling onions and popping mustard seeds, the smell of garlic and garam masala and ginger and coriander, and the familiar sight of Mum, standing with one flip-flopped foot resting on a bench, cutting potatoes into the palm of her hand with the blunt, serrated, black-handled knife she used to cut everything from onions and chicken to garlic and fruit. This would be our time machine. If the kitchen looked and sounded like the kitchen I grew up in, it would be like she was there with us.
The recipe listed the things we needed for the marinade: yoghurt, ginger and garlic; tomato puree, chilli powder, turmeric, cumin and coriander powder; garam masala, fresh coriander – finely chopped – two serving spoons of oil.
We didn’t have any tomato puree. Only four cherry tomatoes. My wife suggested we chop them up finely and add them in with sugar. I said no. We had to do this properly. After 15 minutes of argument, my sister called a truce by placing Mum’s metal marinating bowl in front of us. “Now what?” she asked. “There’s no measurements to go on.”
I said: “We start with two serving spoons of oil.”
“That’s too much,” said my wife.
“We stick to the recipe,” I said firmly, pouring the oil over the chicken. My sister looked at the tray and poured in more oil. I glared at her. “It wasn’t enough,” she said. I added a pinch of all the spices and stirred.
“There’s no salt in the recipe.”
“Mum put salt in everything,” I told my wife. “We should put salt in.”
“I thought you wanted to follow the recipe exactly,” my wife said, flashing me a sarcastic smile. “We shouldn’t put salt in if it doesn’t say salt,” my sister agreed.
We cut the chicken into pieces and rubbed the marinade over them, placing the trays in the fridge. It didn’t feel right, I thought. There was too much oil. It was going to ruin the whole thing. That night I couldn’t sleep, haunted by the excess of sunflower oil. I crept downstairs and as quietly as I could, pulled the trays of marinated chicken out of the fridge. The yoghurty marinade had separated from the extra unwarranted dollop of sunflower oil and there was a thick, greasy film swimming around the chicken. I poured the excess oil out, trying to stop the marinade disappearing with it.
Hours later, my sister and I sampled a piece before it was served. “Smells about right,” I said. She nodded. “Every year Mum asked me if I wanted to learn how to make this,” she said. “I don’t know why I always said no.”
“Mum’s chicken smelled stronger than this, more chickeny.”
I lifted the chicken to my mouth and put it in. There was a cacophony of tastes, the lilt of the lemon, ginger and garlic working like a tightly knit kabaddi team, the piquant persistence of the chilli powder, the warm gloop of yoghurt and the singe of cumin all dancing in my mouth – like a parade of elephants surrounded by bhangra dancers hoisting their arms in the air, with trumpets blaring and dhols banging. I rolled my head back in hypnotised, dizzying jubilation and … it didn’t taste anything like my mum’s Christmas roast tandoori chicken. It tasted like an imitation.
I swallowed the chicken and looked at my sister.
“It needs more salt,” she said. And I agreed.

Brief letters: Blair’s manners with Murdoch | How to survive liberal-elite families | Reasons for Hope | Malt extract
Franca Sozzani, the editor-in-chief of Italian Vogue, has died after a year-long illness. While she might not have been a global household name like her US counterpart and friend Anna Wintour, she was undoubtedly a giant of Italian fashion. The industry has responded accordingly. In a tribute published on the American Vogue website, Wintour describes her as “the hardest-working person I have known, and with an envy-inducing ease with multitasking”. A post on Marc Jacobs’ Instagram reads: “Her incredible contribution to fashion will be missed.”
At the helm of the Italy’s most prominent fashion magazine for 28 years, Sozzani became known for working with photographers including Bruce Weber, Paolo Roversi and Steven Meisel on a magazine that was known for cutting-edge, talking-point visuals that often provoked debate. Sozzani produced an all-black issue in 2008, with only black models featured. It was reprinted three times. A plus-size issue followed three years later. She was the first to embrace the rise of reality TV stars, putting Kim Kardashian on the cover of L’Uomo Vogue (which she also edited) in 2012, two years before American Vogue did the same.
Sometimes Sozzani’s work was more controversial when the commercial nature of fashion jarred with issues of body image and gender politics. One shoot, in 2005, was based on women having plastic surgery; another, in 2014, prompted by the rise of domestic violence in Italy, featured girls running from knife-wielding men. “Fashion isn’t really about clothes,” she said. “It’s about life.” Sozzani saw anything that was part of the cultural conversation as fair game for a fashion shoot. She wanted to join that conversation.
Her work shouted loudly, but Sozzani herself was a quieter presence on the fashion circuit, familiar to those in the know for her long-blond hair, uniform of 50s-style flared skirts, white shirts, diamond teardrop earrings and beatific smile. This continued until very recently. Despite being on oxygen, she appeared at the fashion awards in London earlier this month, to accept her award for positive change. Her final Instagram is a post of her, Wintour and Karl Lagerfeld at the Chanel show in Paris the same week.
The Sozzani family is a dynasty at the heart of Italian fashion. Her sister Carla founded the concept store Corso Como, and her son, Francesco Carrozzini, is a video director who worked with Lana Del Rey and Beyoncé. His last film, Franca: Chaos and Creation, a documentary six years in the making, was a portrait of his mother. It will be released in early 2017.
Sozzani was made for fashion, arguably, due to her ability to continually reflect the moment. “It’s not that I don’t think of the past, but it’s a waste of time,” she told the Observer at the end of November. “If you’re stuck in the past, beholden to it, then your creativity is stuck there, too, because you don’t give yourself a chance to evolve.”
I still have a fair bit of respect and admiration for Tony Blair, but even if I didn’t I would have been mightily impressed by his response to Rupert Murdoch’s demand that the then PM intervene on his behalf with the European commission (Report, 21 December). Apparently Mr Blair “offered to reflect on how best to approach the commission”. Surely the most subtle and inoffensive “fuck off” in history?

• After Stuart Heritage’s hints on how the liberal-elite family should deal with a potentially uncomfortable Christmas gathering alongside Brexiteers (G2, 22 December), I trust you will, in your tradition of fair play, now offer corresponding advice on how we who voted Brexit (and yes, buy the Guardian) should respond to our liberal-elite family members.

• Hours after Nigel Farage labelled the organisation “extremist” (Report, 21 December), 50 members and friends of Hope not Hate in Nottingham are preparing a free Christmas meal for 150 people from the city who cannot afford one for themselves. If this is extremism, count me in.

How clean is your sleeping? And, no, this has nothing to do with changing the sheets more often. Actor and queen of dubious wellness fads Gwyneth Paltrow is now seeking to do for the previously straightforward and cost-free business of going to sleep what annoying green-juice gurus have done for eating: turn it into yet another manic form of self-improvement.
“Clean sleeping”, according to a new book from her lifestyle website Goop, turns out to be remarkably like the boring old sleeping you’ve been doing all your life, only more time-consuming and expensive.
First, download and learn some special yoga techniques. Then massage your feet for three minutes every night with special cream. And, finally, why not splash out £50 on a special pillowcase “infused with fine strands of copper oxide”, which supposedly reduces wrinkles through the power of – and I’m paraphrasing a lot here – metal ions and witchcraft?
Because sleep, according to Gwynnie, who claims at least seven or eight hours of it a night, is going to be 2017’s “biggest health trend”. Heaven only knows how the increasingly preposterous clean movement is going to top this. Clean breathing, maybe, using special fresh air bottled and sold at £70 a pop? Or are they finally clean out of ideas?
Don’t get me wrong; I’m as tempted as anyone, right now, just to shut out the big bad world and contemplate my navel for a while. Why not forget about the scary things nobody can change, and concentrate on those you can, such as losing half a stone and making a New Year resolution to be more patient with the kids?
Who knows, perhaps everything else will just magically fall into place if we can all become marginally better, thinner and more organised, if slightly self-obsessed, people. Just plug into your mindfulness app, strip away the horrid toxins polluting your clean life or – if that all sounds too hard – simply curl up with one of the umpteen books churned out this year on how to do hygge, the Danish art of cosiness.
But the truth is that most Brits are making a reasonably passable go of life as individuals. It’s as a collective – a people who used to rub along well enough, but seem increasingly incapable of tolerance, empathy or letting go of our cherished individual grievances – that we’re failing. Louise Casey’s review said migrants needed to integrate better into British society. In fact, it’s all of us.
Sixteen years ago, sociologist Robert D Putnam published Bowling Alone, which identified a growing threat to democracy from what he called declining “social capital”, or a reduction in humans doing ordinary everyday things together – such as joining a bowling league or volunteering for the parent-teacher association.
The idea that doing small things in collaboration with others encourages people to participate more actively in society as a whole – perhaps by turning out to vote or paying taxes to support public services – was fashionable in Labour circles in the past decade and lived on under David Cameron in the guise of the policy he initially hoped would define him, the ultimately doomed big society.
Togetherness and social cohesiveness is also an underlying theme of hygge, although you wouldn’t know it from the saccharine British magazine interpretations, generally involving images of a lone woman blissfully drinking hot chocolate in cashmere socks. (As an exasperated Danish friend pointed out, the whole point is that you’re not meant to get hyggelig on your own. It’s about togetherness, friendship and quite often communal singing – not expensively accessorised me-time – as such, it’s hard to disentangle from communitarian Scandinavian attitudes more generally.)
But whatever it does or doesn’t do for democracy, evidence suggests that looking outwards rather than inwards – strengthening your ties to others, finding ways to be part of something bigger – does at least make people happier than obsessing on themselves. If there’s a basic human skill we need to improve and practise, it’s not eating or sleeping, but the rusty art of togetherness.
Sitting dutifully through the school carol service in the village church last week, I felt myself getting emotional in a way that can’t entirely be explained by the sight of tinsel-haloed small people squawking Away In a Manger. There was something unexpectedly moving about the sound of voices coming together at the end of a harsh, divisive year.
Joining a choir has been said to help sufferers of depression and anxiety, and it’s not hard to see why singing together could unlock emotions that doing it alone in the shower does not. There is something powerful about the synchronicity of singing in time with others, the way each voice in a harmony relies on the rest. Choirs are now so popular that there are even versions specifically for hopelessly bad singers, who just want to join in.
Outlets for this fuzzy and half-articulated desire for togetherness are everywhere. It’s there in the renewed popularity of live events, from festivals to lecture tours, and in the unstoppable rise of social media. It’s there on dancefloors, but also in the rise of grassroots movements such as Momentum – at least until zealots predictably began trying to divide and conquer – and it is also welling up in More United, the centrist grouping set up after Brexit to crowdfund for candidates standing or openness and tolerance.
A third of Britons feel motivated to do something vaguely political as a result of this year’s events, according to a More United poll this week and, while most wouldn’t join conventional parties, they do want to come together in some other way, even if they’re not yet clear how or why.
But togetherness was there in leavers voting in the EU referendum, too, finally finding a tribe with which they could identify and a way to feel they mattered. You don’t necessarily have to agree with the reasons people want to be together to accept that they do.
There’s nothing intrinsically wrong with resolving to be a better person, or with occasionally longing – as Voltaire’s Candide put it – just to cultivate your own garden for a bit, and stop worrying about other people’s. But don’t kid yourself about what it actually achieves. As an idea, “better together” has been rather tarnished by political association. Still, it’s true all the same.
By the time you read this, we’ll have endured 54 days of full-on festive hype since the Christmas promotions kicked off the day after Halloween. And I, for one, have had enough. If I have to hear – or write – about another claret or châteauneuf that’s perfect for the turkey, I’m going to give up the day job. So here, for fellow grumps and Scrooges, is an alternative Xmas (or alt-xmas, as I suppose we must now call it) drinking plan.
For those who do not want to hear that you need to leave a glass of sherry out for Santa, try madeira or marsala for a change. Waitrose has the delicious, slightly orangey Curatolo Marsala Superiore Dolce (18% abv) for just £11.29. You could use whatever Santa and Rudolph don’t drink to make zabaglione before dry January sets in.
Similarly, refuse to drink French wine with your Christmas dinner, and instead go for a lush South American red. I asked my local wine shop in Bristol, Davis Bell McCraith, to recommend an alternative to claret and they came up with a cracking Argentinian malbec/cabernet blend called Amancaya (£15.99 DBM, £14.50 Fareham Wine Cellar, £17.50 Oxford Wine Company; 14.5% abv), a joint collaboration between Lafite Rothschild and Nicolas Catena. After all, it’s much more fun chatting to the staff in a local indie on Christmas Eve than battling the supermarket queues.
Starting with smoked salmon? Drink sauvignon blanc rather than champagne. Or a fragrant malt whisky such as the delicate, sweet, heathery Mackmyra Brukswhisky Swedish Whisky (£42 Oddbins; 41.4% abv), which is one of the most delicious drams I’ve tasted this year.
And with the stilton? Please not port again: go and track down a bottle of sloe gin, which in my book is the best present bar none to take to friends or family you’re staying with. Tesco’s Finest Sloe Gin (29% abv) is not half bad at £14 for a full-size bottle, and you can always resolve to make your own in 2017. Alternatively, buy a full-size bottle of the dark, rich, sweet Port Barrel-Aged Greenwich Ale (6% abv) that Meantime has made for Marks & Spencer this year: great value at £5.50.
Finally, your friends will love you if you bring along the ingredients for knocking up a few cocktails. The best bargain of all is an orange liqueur called L’Esprit d’Orange (22% abv), which is a ridiculously cheap £4.99 at Lidl and which you could also add to caramelised oranges, a sorbet or a batch of marmalade; I even add a dash to my mulled wine. Happy Christmas – and thank goodness it’s nearly over.

Wall Street has rediscovered its appetite for Weight Watchers shares after the company’s most famous customer and investor, Oprah Winfrey, revealed the results of her new diet.
Shares in Weight Watchers jumped by almost a fifth on Thursday following the news that the broadcasting titan had lost 18kg (40lb) by following the company’s latest guidance.
A new advertising campaign showed Winfrey urging viewers to “take the leap”, as she clinked wine glasses with friends over spaghetti and salad.
“Since I started Weight Watchers, I’ve lost over 40lb. I can honestly tell you I struggle no more,” declared Winfrey, who bought 10% of the company in October 2015. “I’ve eaten everything I love, tacos, pasta. I’ve never felt deprived.”
In a second advert, Winfrey insists people can lose weight without giving up the foods they love. “Weight Watchers is easier than any other programme I’ve ever been on,” she says.
Investors lapped up the message and sent Weight Watchers shares soaring by 18% to $12.35, their biggest move in 10 months.
The ads are due to air on US television and social media from 26 December, a time when potential customers will be looking to burn off their Christmas calories.
Weight Watchers has suffered in recent years as consumers have moved away from diet programmes, in favour of healthier eating, calorie-counting apps and activity trackers such as FitBit.
Shares hit a one-year low of below $10 in September after the chief executive, James Chambers, resigned. They soared to $26 after Winfrey bought her stake in the firm 14 months ago.
Supermarkets are braced for their busiest day of the year on Friday, with shoppers expected to spend nearly £900m on groceries for the Christmas break.
Tesco, the UK’s biggest supermarket, is expecting 10 million shoppers and to sell one-third of its Christmas turkeys, as 200,000 customers buy their birds and turkey crowns in one day. Sainsbury’s said its busiest shopping period would start at about 12pm.
Although many people make last-minute purchases on Christmas Eve, traditionally the number of shoppers out and about the day before Christmas is one-fifth lower than on 23 December.
But with Christmas Day falling on a Sunday, potentially leaving time for a full day of shopping on Christmas Eve, retailers are expecting to be busy.
The number of shoppers visiting the UK’s high streets and shopping centres was down 7.7% last week, according to shopper tracking company Springboard, and retailers are holding their breath for a final dash to stores.
Waitrose, which announced a 1.7% drop in sales last week on the same period last year, said many shoppers were holding off to make their big purchases later. It expects takings to be three-and-a-half times higher than on a normal Friday.
Grocers that focus on premium quality foods usually grab a bigger share of the market at Christmas. Marks & Spencer, which typically accounts for 3% of UK grocery spend, sells one-quarter of all festive turkeys.
In the past few years, discounters Aldi and Lidl have taken a bigger slice of the Christmas pie by tempting shoppers with luxury foods such as lobster and champagne at bargain prices.
This year, the major supermarkets have fought back, with Asda offering seasonal packs of vegetables such as carrots and potatoes for 20p, and Lidl slashing its price to 19p to undercut Tesco’s 39p packs, which were a hit last year.
Meanwhile, Iceland, which has struggled in recent years, has been seeing strong growth. Malcolm Walker, the chief executive of the supermarket, said: “We are on a roll, with everything going well.” He said Friday is expected to be the chain’s best Christmas sales day since its launch more than 40 years ago.
Meanwhile, the rise of next day delivery and click and collect is also encouraging shoppers to leave things later than in previous years.
Online retailers are offering some of their latest order dates in history. Fashion website Asos says shoppers who order before 8pm on Friday will get their gifts ahead of Christmas Day and Debenhams is promising click and collect next day delivery to stores for orders made before 9pm on Friday.
M&S and Next shoppers must order by Thursday night in order to get their gifts on time, although the latter is promising shoppers a refund and gift card if it does not meet its delivery promise.
Which museum will be the next to appoint a female director? Most of the world’s great visual arts institutions remain firmly under male control. The current bosses of the British Museum and the National Gallery in London are men, as are the directors of the Prado in Madrid, the Louvre in Paris and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. So which groundbreaking top-rank art museum will be run by a woman from 1 January 2017?
It is one of the oldest and grandest of them all, and you will find it at the heart of perhaps the most male-dominated enclave in Europe. The new director of the Vatican Museums, whose collections started to be amassed in the Renaissance, is the Italian art historian Barbara Jatta, who previously curated prints there and rose to be deputy director. She has now been appointed by Pope Francis to succeed the current 77-year-old director, Antonio Paolucci, in the new year.
This is not as surprising as it seems. The Vatican may be one of Europe’s last surviving medieval city states, run by cardinals and policed by Swiss guards with halberds (at least that’s how tourists are likely to see them – they have guns and tanks too), but its incredible complex of museums has a history of unexpected modernity. What other religious institution collects atheist art? The modern gallery of the Vatican Museums proudly displays a grotesque painting of a suffering pope by the defiantly godless painter Francis Bacon. That’s probably the most provocative presence in a sensitive and imaginative collection of modern religious art that also includes Van Gogh’s Pietà (after Delacroix) and paintings by Dalí and Picasso.
The Vatican’s museum is so vast and diverse that it is a plural. It is called the Vatican Museums and consists of a connected sprawl of collections that fill a large part of the Vatican itself. Queues often stretch right along the outside of the papal palace complex. Once you get inside, the cornucopia of art includes the Pinacoteca, where such paintings as Leonardo da Vinci’s St Jerome and Caravaggio’s The Entombment of Christ hang; numerous archaeological collections that have everything from giant bowls from Nero’s palace to an extraordinary Egyptian art installation from Hadrian’s villa; and a fine museum of global art.
At the heart of it all is the Belvedere courtyard, one of the oldest extant art galleries on earth. Here stand some of the most renowned masterpieces of classical sculpture including the Apollo Belvedere and the Laocoon. For centuries, this was the most hallowed destination of the Grand Tour. Young aristocrats from all over Europe came to see the Apollo Belvedere, considered in the 18th century to be the most beautiful statue ever made. After paying antiquity its due reverence they made their way, as the crowds still do today, towards the climax of the Vatican Museums – through the rooms of Raphael to emerge into the glory of the Sistine chapel.
It is great that such a majestic and venerable museum has Jatta as its new director. But what should she do to modernise it further? Can such a marvellous collection be improved? In recent years, the big issue for this museum has been to deal with its colossal crowds in spaces that were originally designed for cardinals and popes to spaciously hang out in. Measures have had to be taken to preserve the Sistine frescoes, at risk from the sheer number of people passing through. Jatta will no doubt have to wrestle with these problems just as Paolucci has.
Yet I have a suggestion that, as well as enriching this great complex of museums, might also alleviate overcrowding, simply by providing more spaces to explore. It seems incredible that with so much art and architecture on display the Vatican still has hidden treasures – but it does. Hidden behind closed doors tantalisingly near the museum are Michelangelo’s paintings in the Capella Paolina and Raphael’s Loggia, his greatest work, whose opening might help us understand much better why he is one of the greatest of all artists. In the 21st century it seems archaically exclusive to keep these glories for the eyes of the Vatican elite only. The same progressive spirit that has given the Vatican Museums a female director ahead of comparable art collections must now democratise public access and open up this clerical city’s hidden spaces. That would be a great cultural demonstration of the Vatican’s readiness to change.
The Queen and Prince Philip have flown to their Sandringham estate in Norfolk by helicopter after their initial Christmas plans to travel by train were cancelled because of ill health.
Sky News broadcast live footage showing the helicopter on its way to Norfolk. It landed safely at Sandringham 40 minutes later.
A spokesman would only confirm that the couple had left Buckingham Palace. A spokeswoman declined to comment further when asked about the health of the Queen and the duke.
Earlier, a spokeswoman confirmed that the Queen’s Christmas message would be broadcast as usual at 3pm on Christmas Day. “It is recorded some time in advance,” the spokeswoman said.
The couple had been expected to travel from London to King’s Lynn by train on Wednesday and then on to Sandringham.
But in a statement on Wednesday, Buckingham Palace said: “The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have heavy colds, and so have decided not to travel to Sandringham today.”
On Tuesday, it was announced that the Queen would be stepping down as patron from 25 national organisations at the end of her 90th birthday year, with the patronages passing to other members of the royal family.
The monarch and the 95-year-old duke hosted their annual Christmas lunch for dozens of relatives at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday.
The Prince of Wales did not mention the health of his parents in his Thought for the Day message, which was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Thursday morning. He recorded his remarks about the rise of populist extremism on Monday.
Bah humbug to traditional Christmas movies. At the tail end of December, the last thing you want as small-screen respite from the festivities is another heart-warming story of a magical Christmas. Or anything involving baubles. Here is a selection of films handily airing on TV over the holiday season to help you through this most magical time of the year.
Everyone gets sick of Christmas sometimes. At some point during the festive season, the onslaught of lights and food and sincerity will pile up into an enormous drift and suffocate you alive. But there is an antidote to all this cloying sweetness. That antidote is Jaws.
Forget about human kindness. Jaws reminds us that goodwill to all men only stretches as far as the beach, and after that you’re on your own. The sea is dark and deep, and crawling with leviathans that exist exclusively to murder you, legs first. The world is a scary place, and you had better be ready with your strychnine harpoons and exploding scuba tanks, or else it will take you out. If you look really hard, you will find flashes of Christmas spirit – the scene with Brody and his son at dinner is practically Christmas incarnate – but that’s all window dressing for a story about a shark that would kill you in a second if you let it.
Now that all blockbusters are legally mandated to culminate in scenes in which men with inflatable muscles save a large metropolitan area from a giant space-laser, Jaws is refreshingly simple. There’s a shark. It eats people. Some people go out to kill it. They do. The end. Stripped-down and taut, it is the perfect palate cleanser. In fact, the only thing that could make a Christmas Jaws broadcast any better is if everyone who watched it received a free Mayor Larry Vaughn anchor suit.
In my house, Christmas movies come in two flavours: 80s comedies and period dramas, and The Remains of the Day is the finest modern-day example of the latter. (Ghostbusters is obviously the finest example of the former category, but that’s another issue.) The richest and most moving film from the Merchant Ivory stable, perfectly adapted from Kazuo Ishiguro’s novel, this is the film I want to curl up with on a dark, melancholy winter’s afternoon; its mood matches the darkness outside, but the brilliance of the storytelling and acting thrills me into most unwinterly optimism.
So if you’re the kind of person who bangs on about the Emma Thompson scene in Love, Actually, please – please – watch this instead to see Thompson at her heartbroken best. (Seriously, don’t watch Love, Actually. It is genuinely one of the worst movies ever made.) It’s bittersweet to watch Christopher Reeves now, vibrant and healthy, but how cheering to see him be so good in the kind of dramatic role he so rarely got to play. I can’t watch James Fox enough in this, especially when he, as the foolish Lord Darlington, realises his mistake too late. But this is, of course, really Anthony Hopkins’s movie: he has never been better than he is here as Stevens the butler, Hannibal Schmannibal.
The Remains of the Day is about Britain during the second world war, but it is also about love and missed chances. So Nazi uniforms and longing looks, all in one of the finest British movies made. This is what holiday movie perfection looks like, folks.
When citing the best Charles Dickens film adaptation, some opt for David Lean’s Great Expectations, others for 1951’s Christmas Carol. But I’m sticking with Oliver!, Carol Reed’s boisterous presentation of the Lionel Bart musical, which has been synonymous with Dickens ever since I first watched it as a kid and assumed he must have written all the songs as well. Then, as now, I accept it as an accurate representation of an 1830s London where constables and cutpurses temporarily set aside their differences in order to congregate for a knees-up beside some tavern or other.
In fact, the last time I visited, the film looked just as good as it ever did. I love Oliver! for its rollicking gait and insouciant air and for the robust playing from Ron Moody (as Fagin), Jack Wild (Dodger) and Oliver Reed (a brooding, beautiful Bill Sikes, right before the rot set in). I suspect it might even be a more appropriate seasonal film than A Christmas Carol, in that its world of surging crowds, violent avarice and random kindness speaks more to the reality of Christmas than some pious tale of a miser who winds up buying a turkey.
And maybe the musical is the perfect vessel for Oliver Twist. This takes what might otherwise be seen as the novel’s weak points (the pantomime villainy; the cloying sentimentality; the facile, bouncing-ball plot) and makes a bonus of them. Amplified to a theatrical pitch, the tale casts off its social-realist clogs and begins dancing around the stage-flats like some festive carouser; merry one moment, maudlin the next.
I’ve reviewed the situation; arrived right back where I started. Oliver! (big as life and twice as noisy) remains the perfect Christmas Dickens.
’Tis the season for shameless repackaging and gleeful repetition. So what more fitting late-night, eggnogged-out cheerer-upper than this deliriously silly, but also remarkably smart, comedy sequel? It, too, delights in ostentatious tradition for its own sake; knowing yet affectionate cribbing from the recent past. The plot is exactly the same as the original, 2012’s 21 Jump Street, a belated big-screen transfer for the 80s TV show, this time round starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill.
The undercover cops must infiltrate a place of education (first time round, a high-school; this time, a college) to try to identify the dealer trading in a new drug popular with the students. They must battle youngsters suspicious of their crows’ feet, a tough-talking boss (Ice Cube), and their conflicted feelings about each other. What 22 Jump Street manages, however, is to be a yet-crisper facsimile of the original’s script, its set pieces funnier, its jokes more creative, and its two stars now ebulliently confident of their own skills, and of our love.
But the chief reason it feels fitting for the time of year at which your sense of benevolence might be under strain is that it’s just so damn nice. Rarely has a multiplex bro-romp proved that comedy doesn’t need to be cruel more effectively than this film. It advocates kindness and consideration above all else, in every relationship. It continually wrongfoots the audience with an admirable and very funny gay rights thread, which sees chief jock Tatum rebuking bullies, and himself, for their homophobic language. And its standout gag is a malapropism involving Cate Blanchett. Fun for all the family, almost.
Most Hollywood animations, even the best of them, are put together by teams of laser-eyed professionals who know what works and don’t want to reinvent the wheel. The adorable lead character goes on a journey with songs in the company of quirky animal friends who do quickfire gags. That’s it.
Jerry Seinfeld’s Bee Movie isn’t like that: it feels almost organic, natural, a hand-crafted comedy that follows the meandering, freewheeling train-of-thought typical of this observational comic. In Bee Movie, as in Seinfeld’s TV show, there is no hugging, no learning. Well: a minimum anyway. Seinfeld voices Barry, an idealistic young Everybee who falls in love with a human florist (voiced by Renée Zellweger) but then realises that he and his comrades are being systematically exploited for their delicious honey by their human oppressors.
The romantic storyline is supplanted by a hilarious, but weirdly inspiring courtroom saga in which Barry takes on the big human battalions and people such as Sting, who is guilty of cultural appropriation with his contemptible “prance-about stage name”. It is a comedy that starts funny, is funny in the middle, and ends up funny, unlike the usual Hollywood model in which the movie is frontloaded with humour – the laughs are only in the premise, the opening act, before it winds down into sentimentality. Bee Movie is a rare treat and one of Seinfeld’s unsung achievements.
Christmas holiday? Work is a holiday compared with Christmas. Which is why my kind of film at this time of year is one that a) requires minimal brainpower, b) makes me laugh, c) I haven’t seen for a while, and d) has nothing to do with Christmas. The Naked Gun ticks those boxes. Most people remember Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker’s earlier hits, Airplane! and Top Secret! The Naked Gun is more of the same: a spoof of the hard-boiled detective thriller packed with nonsense dialogue, corny puns, movie parodies and inspired slapstick, all carried by the zen master of deadpan, Leslie Nielsen.
I still find it difficult to keep a straight face thinking of, say, Nielsen’s “casing the joint” outing, which ends with him inadvertently destroying Ricardo Montalbán’s office, fellating a gargoyle, then threatening a woman with a stone dildo. Or his mangling of the national anthem while posing as an opera singer at the baseball match. It’s all funnier because it’s him doing it.
There’s an added nostalgia element seeing The Naked Gun now. It was a time when Weird Al Yankovic could be a celebrity cameo, when the US’s enemies included Idi Amin, Ayatollah Khomeini and, er,, er, Mikhail Gorbachev, and when OJ Simpson was a lovable former sporting hero (in a karmic running gag, he is accidentally clobbered every time he appears).
Yes, The Naked Gun is dated, occasionally dodgy, and very silly, but the carpet-bombing of comedy will satisfy the sternest of critics, the shortest of attention spans and the weariest of festive souls. At this time of year, I’m all three.
There are only three main performers in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels: Michael Caine as a debonair conman living high on the hog in the Côte D’Azur; Steve Martin as the uncouth pretender who becomes Caine’s own Eliza Doolittle; and Glenne Headly as the out-of-towner whom the tricksters compete to swindle. But the list of aliases distributed among the cast (including Dr Emil Shaffhausen, Lady Fanny of Omaha, Chips O’Toole and Ruprecht the Monkey Boy) suggests a far larger ensemble.
This 1988 romp is a celebration of performance and play-acting, of putting on daft voices and spinning tall tales. The scoundrels have transformed their lives into playgrounds where they do nothing but lark around in pursuit of money. For once, women get to play too: Headly is a hoot, and watch out also for Barbara Harris, from Nashville and Family Plot, as a credulous holidaymaker with more riches than sense.
Frank Oz directs briskly on sets and locations that would make a department store lighting section look murky. This may not be great cinema, but it is great comedy, with no end of delirious set-pieces, from Martin trying and failing repeatedly to remember Caine’s name while stuck in prison, to the torture Caine puts him through during one ruse when he is feigning paralysis. Such casual venality may not sound so funny when the world is staring down the barrel of the next US administration. The film is a good way, though, to forget for a few hours about any real-life dirty rotten scoundrels out there.
There is a special category of films that don’t get much acclaim: The Ones You Always Watch When They’re On. You know: you turn on the TV, tired and/or bored, can’t be doing with anything that takes effort. There’s this thing, it’s on, you think about flipping channel but for some reason, you keep going, and going, and going …
The king of TOYAWWTO used to be Bond, or the Carry Ons – but who, seriously, can be doing with them nowadays? For me, the archetypal TOYAWWTO is Starship Troopers: I must have seen it 50 times. Close second: The Matrix. But neither of them is on over Christmas as far as I can see, so it’s down to No 3 on the list: The Terminator.
More than 30 years on, The Terminator looks distinctly odd in parts: Linda Hamilton’s fuzz-brush haircut for one, the slavering worship of naked Arnie for another. It’s also strange to dwell on James Cameron’s idea of an early 80s nightclub for punks and hipsters, as well as his not-far-beneath-the-surface homicidal hatred of those selfsame punks and hipsters. But The Terminator remains as fantastically watchable as ever, in the purest sense of the word: it’s like gobbling down a whole tube of glucose tablets in one go, without the long-term medical consequences.
When you are punchdrunk from festivity, Christmas is a great time for TOYAWWTO. (It’s not just about action or sci-fi; Room with a View, for me, is a big one, and I don’t think it’s possible to watch End of the Century, the Ramones doc, too many times.) The only downside that I can see is that The Terminator doesn’t seem to have been double-billed with Terminator 2. So perhaps all our Christmases haven’t come at once.
Rose Evansky, who has died aged 94, was from the early 1950s to the mid-60s the only woman with a major salon in Mayfair, London, and was a pioneer in the use of the hand-held blow dryer. She regarded her work as a personal service, rather than a vehicle to promote herself. Evansky empathised with her customers, since she knew just how much grooming cost in time and money, especially for women whose hair had natural kinks or curls resistant to smoothing – and she hated the process of straightening hair.
In 1962 she noticed through the window of a nearby barber’s shop that its proprietor was using a powerful new hand-held dryer, in conjunction with a brush, to smooth a man’s hair. Men had never been subjected to the torment of sitting for an hour or more with hair doused in chemicals and yanked on rollers, under a fixed hood of hot air.
Soon afterwards, Evansky was seen trying the technique in her salon, on a Mrs Hay, by the rule-breaking Vogue “Young Ideas” editor Clare Rendlesham, who immediately summoned up publicity for Evansky’s blow-wave – it worked on straight hair, too. Within a year, all Mayfair’s leading stylists offered it. Waving a dryer became part of the drama of their act.
Reaching Mayfair had been an achievement. Rose’s family fled antisemitism in Poland after the first world war to settle in Germany, but under Nazi rule Rose’s father, Max Lerner, was sent to Dachau in 1938. He was released the following year and left for Britain, where he was joined by his wife, his son, Heinie, and Rose. She was 16 and spoke only Yiddish and German when she boarded one of the last kindertransport trains to safety in the UK.
The family found a home in the East End of London, and Rose took an apprenticeship with Adolf Cohen of Whitechapel Road, the “professor” of the hairdressing trade (who also trained Vidal Sassoon). At 20, she married a fellow hairdresser, Albert Evansky. After the war, when “getting your hair done” had become a middle-class norm, the couple opened their first salon, in 1947 in the north London suburb of Hendon.
It was successful enough by 1953 to allow them to rent posher premises in North Audley Street, Mayfair. Their salon was sympathetic to workers as well as clients: Evansky accepted Leonard Lewin, later Leonard of Mayfair, as an apprentice, after the celebrated Freddie French had rejected him because of his rough background.
Evansky’s hand blow-drying displeased her husband, who complained: “Have you gone mad? We’ve just bought 20 new hood dryers. What shall we do with them? Throw them out?” (The salon kept a few for high-dressed, lacquered styles, and older clients.) The marital relationship was failing.
Evansky disliked the way fashionable hairdressing was becoming about flamboyant male stylists who wanted only young clients and often cut their hair without regard for their identity or feelings.
She had made friends through clients, among them the playwright and script-doctor Denis Cannan; after both had divorced their spouses, they married in 1965, and by the end of the decade Evansky had left hairdressing to live with him in the Sussex countryside.
They returned to London for a while, then retired to Hove, East Sussex. After she was noticed at the launch of a book by another 1960s hairdresser, and interviewed by radio and fashion press, she wrote a memoir, In Paris We Sang (2013).
Feminist groups in Lebanon have called for protests over the appointment of a man as the country’s first-ever women’s affairs minister.
The choice of Jean Ogasapian to run the ministry has sparked widespread disbelief and mockery over what many perceived as an insult to Lebanon’s active women’s rights movement.
Nasri Atallah, a Lebanese writer, described it as “the ultimate act of mansplaining”.
The Lebanese government convened this week for the first time since Saad Hariri was sworn in as prime minister. It capped two and a half years of a political vacuum during which the country had no president.
Amid the political jockeying for seats in the cabinet, which are divided by sectarian loyalties and allegiance to the country’s many warlords-turned-politicians rather than any measure of competence, Ogasapian’s appointment drew strong derision.
KAFA, a prominent women’s rights organisation, called for protests under the slogan, “No women, no legitimacy”.
“The government that has been announced is a clear indictment to all the politicians who took part in creating it,” the organisation said in a statement. “It is an insult to all women.”
Lebanon faces many challenges in advancing women’s rights in a nation that has a thin veneer of westernisation but remains deeply patriarchal. Domestic violence is pervasive in the country, and Lebanese women cannot pass on their citizenship to their children if they marry foreigners.
Only this month, the parliament began the process of repealing an article in the penal code that allowed the halting of a rape prosecution if the perpetrator married his victim.
Commentators on social media satirised the appointment of a man in the women’s affairs ministry – a state ministry that will probably have little power to advance women’s rights.
One common joke showed Rosie the Riveter, who symbolised American women working in shipyards in a second world war poster campaign, with Ogasapian’s face transposed over Rosie’s.
Rima Njeim, a popular radio host, joked that a male women’s affairs minister could extend maternity leave until a newborn starts school or make all women retake their driving licence tests.
Others pointed out that few of the other ministers were suited to their jobs. The tourism minister, for example, has a degree in physics; the minister of culture is a vascular surgeon; the agriculture minister is a lawyer; and the minister of public health holds a degree in engineering.
Lebanon’s new government, led by the son of the assassinated former prime minister Rafik Hariri, faces numerous problems, including decaying infrastructure and power cuts to recurring crises in rubbish collection, caring for a refugee population from Syria that numbers more than a million, and containing the fallout from the war in which Hezbollah, the most powerful military organisation in the country, is fighting for the regime of Bashar al-Assad.
Abortion today is an extremely safe, straightforward procedure, provided in a highly regulated environment. One in three women in the UK will have an abortion in her lifetime, funded by the NHS (except if she lives in Northern Ireland). This will usually take place within an NHS hospital or in a centre run by one of the independent charitable providers – the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) or Marie Stopes International (MSI). But just because it is safe doesn’t mean corners can be cut, or providers can pick and mix from rules and regulations, as was unearthed in the course of the care quality commission’s investigation of MSI.
Some of the failings found at MSI have no implications for safety. The batch signing of abortion forms, for example, has no clinical significance – it is simply a legal requirement that all women have their abortion request legally authorised by two doctors. But the other problems uncovered – from clear deficits in clinical governance at the top level through to problems with safeguarding and consent, to the report of the appalling handling of a vulnerable patient – can leave us in no doubt that the CQC was not over-reacting when it requested MSI suspend its services over safety concerns earlier this year.
Clinical supervision and governance structures, training and upskilling staff and recruiting the right people to leadership positions takes time – and money. Adhering to legal requirements that have no clinical benefit may be irksome and expensive, but that’s life. If you operate in a highly regulated environment and believe women deserve high-quality care, these measures are not optional.
Abortion is an easy procedure when everything goes right – but you can’t run a clinical service on the assumption that everything runs to plan. The best doctors experience patients who develop complications, unexpected problems arise in the healthiest patients, clients need access to good counselling services and support. Research and innovation is essential to determine best practice. This costs – but it’s not just a matter of cost but of commitment, and focus on values.
The BPAS has been delivering not-for-profit services since the 1967 Abortion Act came into force, providing high-quality, compassionate care that the NHS either could not, or would not provide from its own facilities. It was founded by a former abortion law reformer who saw that the inability of the NHS to meet women’s needs would push them into paying extortionate sums for poor-quality care by private doctors.
In the 1970s, MSI joined BPAS as a charitable provider. Today some 200,000 women a year in the UK have an abortion. MSI provides about a third of all abortion care , BPAS a further third, and the remainder are performed in NHS premises.
In a parody of market economics, the two charities now compete with each other and with local NHS hospitals for regional contracts to provide NHS abortion services. With NHS funds shaved, the price commissioners will pay is driven down. In the current commissioning environment a cheaper service will trump a quality service almost every time.
We all deserve an honest and open discussion about how this essential women’s healthcare service is commissioned and provided in an environment of cost-cutting. On the brink of the 50th anniversary of the Abortion Act, BPAS is absolutely clear, abortion must be fully decriminalised and women finally trusted to make their own reproductive choices for themselves – and they must be able to exercise those choices in clinics providing safe, high-quality abortion care.

At a “thank you” rally in early December, Donald Trump promised that he would Make Christmas Great Again.
“We’re going to start saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again!” Trump told the crowd in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
“How about all those department stores?” he mused.
“They have the bells and they have the red walls and they have the snow. But they don’t have ‘Merry Christmas’.
“I think they’re going to start putting up ‘Merry Christmas’.”
Given this full-throated pledge, it might come as a surprise to learn that Trump Tower, the golden jewel in Trump’s property portfolio and the building where he is currently plotting his first term, has no signs saying “Merry Christmas” whatsoever.
Visiting the Trump Tower on Wednesday, it was clear that holiday decorations have not been eschewed altogether. In fact, it’s the opposite. The interior of the building is festooned with festive frippery.
There is a 30ft Christmas tree. There are four-foot wreaths all around the entrance area.
There are scores of golden boxes, tied up with ribbons, laid around the place, as if Santa Claus gave up on his way to the Trump residence and dumped the presents in the lobby.
There are life-sized nutcracker statues, some holding trumpets.
The only mention of Christmas the Guardian could find in Trump Tower was in the gift shop, where a little Christmas tree bauble, which showed Santa Claus lying down on top of a yellow taxi, was described as a “Christmas ornament”. The ornament had been made in China.
Trump has promised that he will return Merry Christmas to common parlance before – most notably in November 2015, when he was gearing up for the Republican primaries.
It makes sense. The idea of a war on Christmas – that Americans are being forced to say “happy holidays” instead of “merry Christmas” because of political correctness – is a popular theory among some conservatives.
But outside Trump Tower, at least, the reaction to “merry Christmas” making a comeback – if you accept that it ever left – was mixed.
“I don’t think people are maliciously trying to tamp down Christmas celebrations,” said Bradley Bennett, 37.
“I don’t spend any time thinking about whether someone wishes me happy holidays or merry Christmas. They’re just trying to wish me well and wish me a good day.”
Bennett was with his three-year-old son Philip, who described Trump as an “evil man”.
The president-elect’s yuletide pledge was better received by Faye Schimek, 74. She was in New York City from near Houston, Texas, to visit her grandson and granddaughter.
“They want to be too politically correct,” Schimek said of those people who prefer the phrase happy holidays to merry Christmas.
Schimek was in the process of buying two political satire books from a man called Loren Spivack. Spivack, who uses the nom de plume “Mr Truth”, had written the books himself.
Both works poke fun at the Democratic party – specifically Barack Obama, who is portrayed as the Cat in the Hat, and Hillary Clinton, who is imagined as the witch from The Wizard of Oz.
“I don’t think there’s anything wrong with saying ‘merry Christmas’,” Spivack said.
Trump has four years to force “merry Christmas” upon the American public, so perhaps change will eventually come to the US. He could certainly start by using the phrase in his own building.
When the news broke that the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) is setting a new diversity standard, I was sceptical. From 2019, films will only be eligible to win the Bafta for outstanding British film or Outstanding debut by a British writer if they meet two of four criteria: movies must prove they have worked to improve diversity across characters and themes, senior roles and crew, industry training and progression, or appeal and be accessible to under-represented audiences. Alongside this criteria, Bafta has also changed the rules for admitting new members: people will no longer need to be recommended by two existing members to join.
I am one of the many film fans that finds the diversity debate tedious. The #OscarsSoWhite hashtag has been rolling around Twitter for years, and every awards season finds actors and filmmakers on roundtables speaking about ways the industry needs to be more diverse. But, year on year, things just don’t change. Last January, after yet another all-white list of acting nominees, the Academy awards announced a “sweeping series of substantive changes” that included “a goal to double the number of women and diverse members of the Academy by 2020”, but soon took great pains to reassure its older, white, male members that any changes would not be at their expense. I assumed the Bafta commitment would be just another vague gesture.
However, after fully reading the list of criteria and the statements from Bafta itself, I’ve got to admit that I’m impressed and cautiously optimistic for the future of British film. Diversity is such a tricky concept to attempt to quantify because it means so much, but it’s clear the Bafta team is looking beyond merely race; women, disabled and LGBT+ people, and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds will count towards achieving the diversity goals.
Despite the fears of some, I don’t believe the criteria will force films to insert arbitrary black, female, disabled, working-class or LGBT+ characters in an attempt to qualify. I recognise that art is art, and I’m sure there are films being made where it really is necessary for everyone on screen to be white or straight. What I refuse to accept is that there aren’t more films that can have more diverse characters and themes than we currently have. In recent years, the film industry has been open to giving lead roles written for men to women. Actors point out that nothing in the script implies the part needs to be male, and so Julia Roberts took a man’s part in Secret in Their Eyes, Sandra Bullock fought for the lead in Our Brand Is Crisis and, when Brad Pitt left The Gray Man, it was Charlize Theron who took his part. Women go for these roles simply because they’re often better than the parts that are written for female leads, and I wish for a time when their peers from all backgrounds can do the same. The new rules will hopefully force British filmmakers to consider if a character written as a straight, white, wealthy, able-bodied man really needs to stay that way.
That said, Bafta’s criteria explicitly gives filmmakers some leeway. You’re welcome to have an all-white film, for example, but then you need to commit to providing opportunities and having a diverse crew, or find ways for a wide range of people to see your movie. Perhaps these are the criteria that will make the biggest difference in the British film industry. According to the British Film Institute, only 3% to 6% of the cast and crew behind the films we watch are from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. Forty-six per cent of women make up the film workforce, but only 13.4% of UK films released were written by them, with the percentage of films directed by women even lower at 7.8%. The standard routes into the industry of unpaid internships and voluntary roles for “exposure” are deeply inaccessible for those from working-class backgrounds, LGBT+ people are rarely the ones to tell their own stories, and the numbers when it comes to representation of disabled people in the film workforce are particularly dismal at 0.3%.
Perhaps we are a long way from getting diversity in the film industry right, but Bafta’s commitment is a step in the right direction. The wide-reaching criteria acknowledges the way the film industry is connected: films reaching wider audiences can lead to a wider makeup of people entering the film industry, and diverse filmmakers and fewer barriers for the working class can lead to a more diverse cast and crew.
It is obvious Bafta’s move won’t be easy. Does a film need to be diverse across the board, or will all-white and able-bodied films with a mixed-gender cast and crew be enough, for example? I’m sure there will be a lot of kinks to work through as British film-makers find themselves defending the ways they have worked to improve diversity. The crucial point, however, is that now they will at least feel the need to try.
You could not have predicted, looking at the January 2016 issue of British Vogue, that this was the dawn of most tumultuous year in its century-long history. Gigi Hadid smiled out from her first cover, wholesomely covered-up in a weather-appropriate Breton-striped knit and classic black leather jacket, while coverlines promised to help you in the traditional post-Christmas challenge to find your waist and to discover the best cold-weather skincare. So far, so Vogue.
Traditionally, it is the European editions that get the magazine’s name in the headlines. The nipple count in any summer issue of French Vogue is enough to get the internet hot under the collar on any slow news day, although nothing can match the furore around the infamous 2010 shoot featuring primary-school-age girls in heavy eye makeup, low-cut dresses and high heels. Italian Vogue got into hot water in 2012 for a “Haute Mess” shoot, which drew accusations of racism for its dabbling in the imagery of ghetto fabulousness; two years earlier, Steven Meisel shot Kristen McMenamy as a glamorously dead bird, an homage to the animals killed by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill which wasn’t to everyone’s taste.
But in 2016 the upset became the norm, and this year it was the British and American issues of Vogue ruffling feathers. British Vogue pulled off an audacious centenary coup in landing the Duchess of Cambridge in her first ever turn as a cover girl. This seemingly inoffensive portrait of a smiling young royal in a sensible hat was to become the focus of controversy. Critics seized on it as dull and lacking in edge – unflattering comparisons were made with Princess Diana’s seminal 1991 cover, The cloak-and-dagger manoeuvring to keep the royal cover a secret lent a distinctly frosty edge to the BBC’s Inside Vogue documentary. Programme maker Richard Macer took offence at what he felt to be a breakdown of trust with editor Alex Shulman, with the result that the neutral tone usual for a fly on the wall documentary shifted into something unexpectedly cantankerous.
Meanwhile, uptown: never one to be outdone, Anna Wintour was the subject of another documentary, the feature-length First Monday in May, which followed the development of the 2015 Costume Institute Exhibition and its mega opening party, the Met Gala. That film underscored the alpha status of Wintour, who effortlessly stole the show despite sharing the screen with Rihanna and Kanye West. In one memorable scene, Wintour bats away the concerns of museum employees who question the necessity of closing a wing of New York’s largest museum for an entire Sunday for rehearsals, with a haughty and decisive statement that “the public will come back next week.” And while Wintour is certainly dragon lady in chief, her staff have joined her in breathing fire this year. Just in case the impression left by Emily Blunt and co in The Devil Wears Prada that the American Vogue office is inhabited by the scariest women on planet earth was in danger of fading, senior staffers used an innocuous fashion week wrap-up as a platform for a diatribe against bloggers, calling them “pathetic.”
Sadly, Vogue’s influence has its limits. Even the first-ever endorsement of a presidential candidate by Vogue could not win the election for Hillary Clinton. Which means that having spent the last eight years closely allied with the White House, Wintour’s Vogue enters 2017 as something of an enemy of Trump’s state. Watch this space.
As Christmas nears, and output slows, you’re always within six feet of a really grumpy person with a hangover, and many of us are beginning our annual festive slowdown. Office workers aren’t so much phoning it in as wandering away from their desks whenever their phones go off.
In my local supermarket yesterday, I spotted one employee riding up and down the frozen foods aisle while hanging off the side of a cage on wheels, singing “Have a Holly Jolly Christmas” while using a pricing gun as a microphone. Some of our colleagues were last spotted at the bar in Wetherspoon’s at 8pm, on the day of the work Christmas lunch, telling anyone who would listen that 2017 might be the year that they got “really into” Pernod.
While the majority of the working population manages to stay fairly professional for at least 11 months of the year, a few apply December Rules all year round. When you have a “proper” job, there’s always some temptation to behave improperly, and the more boundaries we push, the more relaxed we get about breaking the rules. No one minds the first time you’re five minutes late and panicking breathlessly, so next time it’s 10 minutes, and you stroll in clutching a coffee. You take a long, wine-fuelled lunch with your boss – then a longer, boozier one when your boss is away on holiday.
Suddenly you’re wondering whether it’s OK to take the Post-its home for personal use. Or if you’re Robin Pyke – a former housekeeper – whether you can drive your employer’s Porsche without permission (according to its owner, at least), have your boyfriend over and moonlight as a dogsitter on company property, in company time.
Pyke successfully sued his employers for unfair dismissal, after a tribunal ruled that they didn’t follow the correct procedures in letting him go. Does this mean there’s hope for those workers who might already be worried that they’ve “gone a bit far” this month? Will we all be able to look the boss in the eye on Friday when we wish them a final merry Christmas?
As a former office junior, and a fan of Mad Men, I’ve noticed that those who are the most badly behaved at work are usually the ones with the most power, or at least, an office with a lock on the door. Slacking off is a privilege to be earned. The trick is to know when you’ve been with an organisation long enough to start bending the rules – and to work out when you’ve stayed for too long. Your shortcuts turn into risks and you have to worry about whether you’re going to get yourself sacked, just to stay interested.
Bosses are human beings, and they have the same priorities as the rest of us during December. They just want to get through the month with minimal fuss, avoid any mention of secret Santa and be able to sit in their chair to rest their eyes at 4pm without question or comment. They don’t care what you do as long as it doesn’t disturb this routine. Being late the morning after the Christmas party probably isn’t an issue. Trying on your Asos deliveries in the back boardroom on a very quiet afternoon might be OK. Anything that is going to get you hauled up in front of HR, requiring them to go into that boardroom to tell you off will interrupt their own quiet, lazy routine and make them furious.
Ultimately it’s all about the difference between winding down for Christmas, and winding everyone else up. December marks the end of a long, challenging year. If we began it bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, resolving to give 110%, it’s only natural to end it feeling burned out, less than bothered and running at 90% or less. Laziness is forgivable. But if you’re bored, and using the festive slowdown to cause chaos, break clearly defined rules and make everything more difficult for your colleagues, you should probably start looking for a new job in the new year – and not just because you’re on the brink of being fired.
No one can be bothered to rock the boat in December, so your employers will probably overlook all but the most serious slip-ups. If you’ve got enough creative energy to make them angry, you probably have talents and ambitions that could be better fulfilled in a different workplace.
For many of us, Christmas is a time when we’re forced to leave our cosseted liberal-elite filter bubble of identity politics and small-batch quinoa snackpots and plunge back into the dark heart of Brexit. Spending time with your family – especially when your family doesn’t share your progressive values – can be excruciating at the best of times. But it’s going to be far worse this year, because this year they won.
There are four ways that you can face this onslaught: with a) militant counter-arguments, b) gentle persuasion, c) desperate attempts to find common ground and d) outrageous personal insults. Here are the topics most likely to crop up this year, along with all your potential responses.
a) “Donald Trump has insulted women, Mexicans and the disabled, and all signs point to him being ruinous for western democracy.”
b) “Don’t forget that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, so his mandate isn’t as great as you think.”
c) “I’ll admit that his victory is in keeping with a growing mistrust of the political status quo; I was rooting for Bernie.”
d) “Well, you would say that, you dimwitted oaf.”
a) “He won four Brit Awards, two Grammys, an Ivor Novello award, sold 140m records and is widely regarded as one of the most influential recording artists of all time.”
b) “Oh, come on, I’ve been in the car with you while you were singing along to Jean Genie.”
c) “You know who I miss most? Paul Daniels. Now there was an entertainer with mainstream appeal.”
d) “Oh yeah? Well, I never really understood why Mum ever had sex with you.”
a) “The leaders of the leave movement were a former Times columnist with strong links to Rupert Murdoch, a man who went to the same school as PG Wodehouse and someone called Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson. You would be hard pushed to find a more elitist crowd.”
b) “Please tell me one thing that’s genuinely changed for the better since the Brexit vote.”
c) “I’m not happy about the referendum result, but I guess that’s democracy for you.”
d) “You’re just upset because you think quinoa is a type of Nissan.”
a) “Does he? He has stood for election as an MP seven times, and lost seven times. He hijacked the leave campaign despite being officially sidelined, and all but ambushed Donald Trump to further his own grimy career. The man is a rat.”
b) “Really? Remember that anti-migrant poster he unveiled during the referendum? That seemed especially unpleasant.”
c) “I’ll agree that the moustache he grew was quite funny.”
d) “I can’t wait for you to die.”
a) “The latest migration report from the Office for National Statistics shows that applications for asylum in the UK are almost half of what they were 14 years ago. Your paranoia is the result of a decades-long fearmongering campaign by the rightwing press.”
b) “With the greatest respect, one Nepalese family moving into a house three streets down doesn’t constitute a lot of immigration.”
c) “Yes, but look at how much better the restaurants have got.”
d) “Pipe down, you racist tit.”
a) “Clearly, that isn’t the argument. This is a movement aimed singularly at a judicial system that’s statistically weighted against black people. What you’re doing is the equivalent of pulling up outside a food bank in a Lexus and whining because nobody is giving you any free baked beans.”
b) “Surely, you can understand the outrage that many felt after George Zimmerman’s acquittal?”
c) “You know what else matters? Stuffing. What a delicious meal this is.”
d) “Yours doesn’t, you absolute spanner.”
a) “One, Harambe was an ape and not a monkey. Two, his shooting raises a number of important questions about the nature of keeping animals in captivity that we would be stupid to ignore at this juncture.”
b) “Of course it makes sense. Zookeepers had to decide between killing a gorilla or potentially allowing it to harm a child. That’s a huge choice.”
c) “People should concentrate on the bigger issues, such as Trump and Farage and ... actually, never mind.”
d) “I wish you would go to Cincinnati so someone could shoot you, you obnoxious tool.”
a) “Really? According to Nasa, the six-month period from January to June 2016 was the warmest half-year on record. Plus, the Arctic sea-ice extent is now 40% smaller than it was 40 years ago. The Earth is undeniably getting warmer.”
b) “That simply isn’t true. You know that outbreak of fungus on your pear tree? The Royal Horticultural Society believes the upsurge of the disease could be linked to climate change.”
c) “Hey, I’m all for anything that lets me wear shorts more often.”
d) “Then this must all be down to the hot air you spout, you flatulent gasbag.”
a) “Did we lose? As well as Hillary Clinton gaining more than 2m more votes than Donald Trump, 62.5% of the British electorate did not vote to leave the EU. Your victories are products of imperfect systems and nothing more.”
b) “The right to freedom of expression is a core foundation of every democratic society. If the results had been reversed, you would want to complain about it, too.”
c) “Win or lose, aren’t we all just people? Aren’t the relationships we have with one another more important than the broad and temporary sweep of international politics? Surely what matters more than anything is our ability to accept each other’s superficial differences.”
d) “I hate you, I hate Christmas and I’m pleased that Auntie June left you for her watercolour tutor.”
To find the dress for you, work within your own style. A bold colour is an easy way to make an impact and florals make a festive addition that feels more relaxed than a LBD
It’s true what they say, Christmas dinner is nothing but a big Sunday roast. What we so-called experts don’t add, however – lest you all decide to bin the turkey and go to the pub instead – is that it’s a Sunday roast where everyone is either half-cut or high on sugar, various relatives aren’t on speaking terms and it’s well-nigh impossible to get a takeaway delivered if it all goes wrong.
Not only that, but it’s happening on a day on which any inadvertent break with tradition, however minor, will pass into family lore, to be retold ad infinitum until everyone involved is long dead. In short, although I don’t want to stress you out, this is one meal it pays to approach with almost military precision and a watertight contingency plan should things start to unravel quicker than the plot of the compulsory Christmas Bond outing.
Consider this article that contingency plan. Rip it out and stash it in the kitchen with the emergency sherry, just in case – a kind of lucky charm, and my Christmas gift to you.
More common than you might think – these are big birds. But it’s easy to solve without resulting to chainsawing the bird in half on the lawn. Instead, whip off the legs by using a sharp knife to cut through the skin at the point where they meet the body so you can see the joint, then pull the leg away from the body until it pops out of the socket. Cut between the joint to finish the job. The legs can be cooked in a separate roasting tin; put them in about half an hour before the bird itself, and you’ll end up with juicy breasts and perfect legs – and who wouldn’t want that for Christmas?
Trust me, however hard you slam the door, it’s not going to make any difference. Fortunately at this time of year you can get away with storing stuff in the garage, porch, conservatory, shed or even the car. As long as it’s somewhere dry and fox-proof, cheese, salad and veg, cooked meats, cream and other dairy will be perfectly fine outside for a few days. Once you get the turkey out on Christmas morning (allow at least two hours for it to come to room temperature before cooking), you can stock the fridge with wine, beer and soft drinks. And if there’s still no room, the quickest way to chill drinks is to stick them in a bucket with equal volumes of ice and water and a good handful of salt.
Special diets are easy to cater for with enough notice, but a last-minute announcement can throw even the best plans into disarray. Hopefully you’ll have olive oil on hand to roast a few goose-fat-free spuds for the wretched boy, but if you don’t happen to have any pastry in the freezer to knock up a freeform cheese tart then keep things simple with a chargrilled wedge of cauliflower, broccoli or cabbage, depending on what you have to hand. Cut through it vertically to give chunky cross-sections or wedges, then brush with oil and season with salt and pepper. Heat a griddle pan to very high, then chargrill on each side until they beginning to blacken and soften. Turn the heat down and cook until tender (about 10 more minutes), then squeeze a little lemon juice over and serve with the usual festive accompaniments, and a fixed smile.
If, even after a decent rest (leave an hour for the juices to be reabsorbed into the meat), the breast is still as dry as dust, then check the legs; as they cook more slowly, they might well be perfect. If so, remove the meat from them and arrange temptingly on a platter to encourage people to take that instead. Carve the breast into thick slices in the kitchen, away from prying eyes, then dip each in warm chicken stock for a couple of seconds before transferring it to a serving dish. Drizzle a ladleful of hot gravy artfully across the top and it will look like you always intended to serve the turkey this way.
We’ve all done it: proudly cut into a magnificently bronzed bird at the festive table only to recoil in horror at the lurid pinkness within. This shouldn’t be a problem if you’ve been sensible enough to invest in a meat thermometer, and not taken the turkey out of the oven until the thickest part of the thigh reaches 65C, but sadly, such hindsight is unlikely to butter any parsnips. Joint the bird, spread the pieces out on a baking tray and roast at 200C, checking their internal temperature every 15 minutes (but no more often, to avoid bringing the oven temperature down). Keep pouring those drinks in the meantime.
Just as sprouts were finally shaking off their sulphurous reputation, you’ve taken your eye off the ball and now the whole house smells like 1955. At this point, remember the cook’s mantra: cream makes everything better. Drain the sprouts very well then, if you were planning to sauté them with bacon, fry that on its own, and toss the sprouts in the pan to coat with the juices at the end. Bring some double cream (about 150ml for every 500g of veg) to a simmer in a small pan along with a crushed clove of garlic and a good grating of nutmeg. Stir in the sprouts, season and tip into an ovenproof dish and top with a handful of breadcrumbs and grated parmesan, if you have some handy. Grill for about five minutes until golden and bubbling, then serve up with some pomp and ceremony as sprout gratin.
As long as they are already cooked through, this one is easy to fix. While someone else is carving the turkey, melt a little more of whatever fat you cooked them in (if it’s not already liquid) and brush this over the top of the pallid potatoes. Toast them under the grill until they achieve your desired shade, then turn them over and repeat the process for golden perfection.
Don’t panic: gravy can sense fear. Instead, calmly take a whisk to the roasting tin or pan and set about breaking down as many large lumps of undissolved flour as you can spot. Pass the gravy through a sieve into a jug and then reheat or, if it still doesn’t seem thick enough, whisk a couple of spoonfuls of warm gravy into a tablespoon of corn or plain flour until you have a loose paste, then very gradually whisk this back into the pan on the hob. Heat, stirring, until the gravy thickens to your desired consistency.
Take a few deep breaths. This happens when custard overheats, and is surprisingly simple to sort if you happen to have a stick blender to hand. Pour the custard out into a heatproof bowl as soon as you notice lumps forming, and then whizz it until smooth. Strain it back into the pan through a sieve and continue stirring until thickened. If you don’t happen to have such an implement, plunge the pan into a sink of iced water as soon as you spot the first lump, and whisk vigorously, channelling all your rage into your wrist. Remember to strain it before serving – if there’s not enough to go round, simply pad it out with more cream and call it crème anglaise.
Although it goes without saying that your pudding ought to be hot, it’s also helpful to warm your booze of choice slightly, too, though obviously not enough to burn off the precious alcohol. You can do this by holding a metal spoon full of it above a candle (which gives you the advantage of being able to tilt the spoon into the flame to catch light as you pour it over the pudding) or alternatively by heating it in a small pan on the hob and using a match or lighter instead. Whichever way you go for, always start by ensuring the lights are off around the table and people are primed and ready to coo appreciatively over your achievement before the damn thing goes out. Happy Christmas, one and all!
I used to be a clinical nurse specialist in kidney transplantation. Prior to that I had been in charge of home heamodialysis and cared for many patients in remote areas. On Christmas Eve I had been working and went to bed around midnight. At 1am I had a call from a patient of mine whom I had looked after on home dialysis. A kidney had become available and he had been called in for a transplant. He was in tears. He told me he had been waiting for this moment for six years but now that the time had come he felt so sad. He was sad that a family was devastated at the loss of a loved one on Christmas Day but happy to have the chance of a new life. I reassured him that the family who had lost a loved one would be comforted that the kidney was being gifted to such a wonderful man who would use the opportunity to lead a full life.
He then told me that he would remember this Christmas Day for the rest of his life and that, on receiving the call, I was the first and only person he wanted to talk to. He said: “You are an outstanding nurse. Wish me luck. Hopefully this is my last day of needing dialysis. Thank you for always being there. I never thought I would say this but I’ll miss you!” He had a transplant that day and had over a decade of healthy kidney function. That Christmas was one of my best ever.
While I’m always a little sad to be away from my family, I’m lucky enough to be part of a wonderful work team. We have our own traditions and put lots of effort into celebrating Christmases spent together. We’ve won the best decorated ward three years running, we all wear Christmas jumpers and eat our NHS Christmas dinners in the canteen together. Our receptionist even comes in on Christmas morning dressed as Santa to deliver our secret Santa gifts. As we work in maternity, anyone who can’t be discharged home to be with family is normally more than happy to be spending their Christmas with us as they’re getting one of the best gifts delivered on Christmas Day. Last year when we started the Christmas Day shift we only had one woman in labour; she needed to be delivered by caesarean section and was taken into theatre. At the same time the brass band and choir had arrived on the ward to sing carols. They stood just outside the theatre and performed When a child is born and Away in a manger while our first baby of that Christmas was born. While all births are wonderful to be a part of, this one was unforgettable; there wasn’t a dry eye in the theatre.
This year will be my first Christmas off this century. I’ve spent the last 15 working with people with learning disabilities in residential care homes. It’s always a great day. Life and bodily functions go on, but the Christmas spirit is always wide and the enthusiasm of the people we support is contagious. Being left in an empty London and watching everyone I know make their way back home is strangely liberating. I’ll feel odd moving with the crowds this year.
One year I was managing a home where there had been a lot of issues with staff and staff tension. It was my first Christmas there and I was determined to make it a special day for everyone. We made so much effort to make it work. We were all eating together with Christmas songs in the background; everyone was wearing a paper hat and a colleague and I burst into tears as a result of what we had achieved.
Over 30 years ago on Christmas Eve morning a teenage girl was transferred from a district general hospital to the regional cardio-thoracic intensive care unit where I worked, having sustained serious chest injuries in a car crash. I was in charge of the unit for the late shift on Christmas Day, and looked after her for the shift. She was on a ventilator and heavily sedated. I can remember her parents at her bedside and explaining every procedure I was carrying out to keep them as well informed as possible and to de-mystify an often frightening environment for families. It was touch and go and she had numerous life threatening emergencies over the next few weeks. No one knew whether she was going to make it, but she did and was discharged a few months later. She returned to the hospital where she had originally been admitted to thank the staff for her initial care. We received a letter from the consultant there telling us he couldn’t believe she’d survived her injuries and praising us all to the skies. I bumped into her a few years later; she was doing her nurse training and wanted to specialise in intensive care.
I no longer work over Christmas, but my favourite memory of doing so was learning that one of my clients, who was over 100 years old, had a daughter who lived around the corner from the sheltered scheme. Her daughter was too elderly and unwell to collect her mother, so I arranged to take her to her daughter’s house where she had Christmas lunch with her daughter, grandchildren and great grandchildren. It still makes me happy to think of it.

This Christmas, don’t expect to see Sir David Attenborough balancing an octopus on top of a warthog while trying to mate a toucan with a shark. Although if the BBC needs a festive ratings boost, it’s a thought.
You might see it happen on your kitchen table, though, if you own Beasts of Balance. The new augmented board game sits somewhere in between Jenga and Skylanders, with your efforts to build a tower of animals reflected in the digital world of its companion app.
The £69 game started life as a project called Fabulous Beasts, co-created by a group of eight to 12 year olds with a British startup called Sensible Objects. One £168k crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter later – plus a name change after a trademark run-in with the Hollywood Studio behind the Fantastic Beasts film – and Beasts of Balance was born.
The aim of the game is to build your tower of animals as high as possible. In the box, you get a battery-powered plinth on top of which you build your stack, an NFC reader to “scan” the Beasts of Balance pieces, and Bluetooth to connect to the companion app for Android or iOS.
You also get a set of durable plastic “artefacts” including six beasts: a bear, an eagle, a shark, a warthog, a toucan and an octopus. They’re colourful and deliberately minimalist representations of the animals, similar to the characters in Crossy Road, but less blocky.
Other pieces include crosses and “migration” arrows; elemental artefacts representing combinations of fire, earth, water and air; and “miracle” artefacts that are this game’s equivalent of power-ups.
Whether you’re playing alone or with others, Beasts of Balance involves stacking the artefacts one at a time to form a tower on top of the plinth, with the twist that as you place them, they appear and have an effect on-screen in the app.
For example, in a two-player game: if the first player scans then places the bear; the second scans then balances the octopus on top of it; and then the first player scans and balances a cross artefact, the two beasts spawn a Pawpoise, which is a combination of the two.
Play progresses from there: the on-screen beasts have a semi-random number of points attached to them, which decrease if a beast is subsequently played that scores a higher number of points. Lower beast scores can be increased by using matching elemental artefacts, such as earth for the land dwelling bear, to try and boost their scores past the highest ranked animal.
The fun comes from finding out what different combinations of beasts and other artefacts do, with new animals stored in the app’s built-in bestiary to track your progress.
When the stack topples, you have a few seconds to reconstruct it before an on-screen volcano erupts, but if you fail it’s game over – and a check to see if your points total beat your previous best effort.
Beasts of Balance is designed as a family game that appeals to the current generation of kids who’ve grown up with tablets, but which also draws them out into tabletop cooperative gameplay with physical objects.
Is the core gameplay mechanic enough to keep those children interested beyond the first few games? It has been for my seven- and nine year-old sons, although not for the reason I expected.
They’re quite interested in filling empty slots in Beasts of Balance’s bestiary, but much keener on uncovering new and better ways to stack its beasts and artefacts, trying new orientations and combinations to build ever-bigger and more-stable stacks.
The cooperative gameplay is one of Beasts of Balance’s selling points, certainly for parents looking for a game to get their family round a table working together, rather than sparking arguments from over-competitive instincts.
The flipside here is that when my two children were playing together, they still managed to argue – usually about whose “fault” it was when the stack toppled.
To put it another way, in a two-player game of Jenga, when one player topples the tower, the other player is the winner, and happy. In a two-player game of Beasts of Balance, the risk is that when the stack falls, both players are furious.
Whether that says more about the inability of my sons to lose graciously rather than a failing in Beasts of Balance I’m not sure.
Sensible Objects has a few ideas to keep the game interesting in the longer term. It’s already selling two new beasts as £15 add-ons: the “Omnibeast” and the “Lalnalion” – the latter designed by YouTube gaming crew Yogscast.
There’s also a £20 “DIY Artefacts” pack of RFID tags, which children can stick to their own toys to make them part of the game. Future updates to the app could also add new gameplay modes, including a more competitive option.
Beasts of Balance isn’t cheap at £69, so that ability for digital updates to breathe more life into its physical components will be important if it’s to provide value for money in the longer term.
The price may put some parents off what is an unknown brand, but early adopters will find lots to enjoy in Beasts of Balance – not to mention getting a sense of how digital and physical play can interweave in a way that gets families laughing together, rather than staring into separate screens.
Christmas shopping with my mother as a teenager in the 1980s: a fraught affair, both of us in our default roles. Me, disabled, a wheelchair user and mum, my primary carer. There’s no social care, no support. My mum, a cheerful, seldom sulky woman, always did her best for me but we got stuck. Me feeling the angst of obligation, seamed with guilt, and my mum gritty in her duty to my needs.
Our shopping relationship attained new levels of mutual frustration at Christmas. Especially when, bitten by the punk revolution, I took to presenting myself in a defiance of multicoloured hair extensions, goth makeup and a preponderance of black. At one point, long-suffering mummy insisted on walking behind me rather than with me, as I cruised forward in my mobility scooter.
Christmas at home in the council estate ghetto of the otherwise well-heeled Chalfonts in Buckinghamshire was not exactly one of shiny baubles and carols round the gas fire. As I grew older I retained a sense of missing out on something even though, post-punk, I espoused a hatred of Christmas and all its consumerist horror. Yet, always contrary, this was the time of my love affair with the mail order catalogue – Marshall Ward, Littlewoods, Ace. I indulged my urge to buy and not worry about paying immediately.
At a time when I had no life and lived in a downstairs bedroom, with the mother/daughter; carer/cared-for roles unchanging, the rebel within me was fighting to find a way out. Meanwhile, I assuaged my conscience, buying Christmas gifts from activist groups – CND, Greenpeace, International Fund for Animal Welfare. The latter had an endless range of baby seal offerings – cute festive pressies for my only two friends. Not so cute when my cheques bounced. And mum going into a righteous silence all through the removal of the decorations.
When I managed to move to east London I had a stab at living independently. In those days, this meant literally attempting to do everything for yourself. An approach that broke down rather quickly when you consider I couldn’t wrap myself in warm clothes, let alone wrap any presents. My first serious boyfriend was no real help to the conundrum of Christmas shopping. He avoided it at all costs.
I took to buying the odd gift surreptitiously when we ventured out for food, although the game was up the year I tried to buy five sets of Snoopy stationery along with the cheese and baked beans.
Then a revelation. A change so fundamental to my Christmas shopping that I can never overestimate its impact. The arrival of Independent Living (IL), as an ideology and a new way of receiving “care” support. Started in the US, at Berkeley, University of California, by disabled students, once it crossed the Atlantic disabled activists in the UK realised it was revolutionary – that independence is about choice, control and facilitation, primarily through giving instructions to another person.
IL brought the development of the Independent Living Fund and the concept of direct payments, which enabled disabled people to manage their own needs: “What I want, when I want it.” An effort towards an equality in daily living that non-disabled people can take for granted.
Don’t get me wrong – it’s great having a personal assistant you have chosen to wash your bottom, make you a cuppa, get you out of bed. But in 1995, in my 30s, here was the ultimate. Christmas shopping in Walthamstow market with Debbie, my first true PA, recruited once my direct payment funding came through.
There are men yelling “pound-a-bowl” and “reeeeeeal Christmas trees, only a fiver!”, amid the East End hustle and bustle. And there I was, in a place where I could indulge my too-long frustrated, inner Christmas shopper – the big kid who has never browsed 100 Christmas fairies or flicked through the Christmas jumpers on 10 different stalls; choosing the very best one for mum.
Debbie came from Nottinghamshire. She was funny, immensely competent, a similar age to me and took it for granted that I would want to have choice in shopping, festive or otherwise.
On shopping trips she was my arms and legs, doing the flicking and packing the goodies into bags. That the only boundaries were ones set by myself – and my bank balance – ignited a lifelong excitement about Christmas shopping. It connected me to a sense of free adulthood, to the simple joy of choosing. When you’ve never had this for most of your developing years, it’s sweet and always will be.
 Of her portraits, she says: ‘I choose people who have a certain way about them, and people seem to see me a certain way and treat me as they think I might like. I assume there’s a big element of projection coming from me too, but working with people always involves collaboration’
The eternal human struggle to live meaningfully in the face of inevitable death entered its newest phase one Monday in the summer of 2007, when employees of Google gathered to hear a talk by a writer and self-avowed geek named Merlin Mann. Their biggest professional problem was email, the digital blight that was colonising more and more of their hours, squeezing out time for more important work, or for having a life. And Mann, a rising star of the “personal productivity” movement, seemed like he might have found the answer.
He called his system “Inbox Zero”, and the basic idea was simple enough. Most of us get into bad habits with email: we check our messages every few minutes, read them and feel vaguely stressed about them, but take little or no action, so they pile up into an even more stress-inducing heap. Instead, Mann advised his audience that day at Google’s Silicon Valley campus, every time you visit your inbox, you should systematically “process to zero”. Clarify the action each message requires – a reply, an entry on your to-do list, or just filing it away. Perform that action. Repeat until no emails remain. Then close your inbox, and get on with living.
“It was really just a way of saying, ‘I suck at email, and here’s stuff that makes me suck less at it – you may find it useful,’” Mann recalled later. But he had stumbled on a rich seam of societal anxiety. Hundreds of thousands of people watched his talk online, and Inbox Zero spawned countless blog posts, along with books and apps. It was the Atkins diet for nerds: if you weren’t doing it yourself, you almost certainly knew someone who was. Mann’s followers triumphantly posted screenshots of their empty inboxes; the New Yorker, discerning his increasingly cult-like following, described his system as “halfway between Scientology and Zen”. (The New York Post called it bullshit.)
If all this fervour seems extreme – Inbox Zero was just a set of technical instructions for handling email, after all – this was because email had become far more than a technical problem. It functioned as a kind of infinite to-do list, to which anyone on the planet could add anything at will. For the “knowledge workers” of the digital economy, it was both metaphor and delivery mechanism for the feeling that the pressure of trying to complete an ever-increasing number of tasks, in a finite quantity of time, was becoming impossible to bear.
Most of us have experienced this creeping sense of being overwhelmed: the feeling not merely that our lives are full of activity – that can be exhilarating – but that time is slipping out of our control. And today, the personal productivity movement that Mann helped launch – which promises to ease the pain with time-management advice tailored to the era of smartphones and the internet – is flourishing as never before. There are now thousands of apps in the “productivity” category of the Apple app store, including software to simulate the ambient noise of working in a coffee shop (this has been shown, in psychology experiments, to help people focus on work), and a text editor that deletes the words you have written if you don’t keep typing fast enough.
The quest for increased personal productivity – for making the best possible use of your limited time – is a dominant motif of our age. Two books on the topic by the New York Times journalist Charles Duhigg have spent more than 60 weeks on the US bestseller lists between them, and the improbable titular promise of another book, The Four Hour Work Week, has seduced a reported 1.35m readers worldwide. There are blogs offering tips on productive dating, and on the potential result of productive dating, productive parenting; signs have been spotted in American hotels wishing visitors a “productive stay”. The archetypal Silicon Valley startup, in the last few years, has been one that promises to free up time and mental capacity by eliminating some irritating “friction” of daily life – shopping or laundry, or even eating, in the case of the sludgy, beige meal replacement Soylent – almost always for the purpose of doing more work.
And yet the truth is that more often than not, techniques designed to enhance one’s personal productivity seem to exacerbate the very anxieties they were meant to allay. The better you get at managing time, the less of it you feel that you have. Even when people did successfully implement Inbox Zero, it didn’t reliably bring calm. Some interpreted it to mean that every email deserved a reply, which only shackled them more firmly to their inboxes. (“That drives me crazy,” Mann says.) Others grew jumpy at the thought of any messages cluttering an inbox that was supposed to stay pristine, and so ended up checking more frequently. My own dismaying experience with Inbox Zero was that becoming hyper-efficient at processing email meant I ended up getting more email: after all, it’s often the case that replying to a message generates a reply to that reply, and so on. (By contrast, negligent emailers often discover that forgetting to reply brings certain advantages: people find alternative solutions to the problems they were nagging you to solve, or the looming crisis they were emailing about never occurs.)
The allure of the doctrine of time management is that, one day, everything might finally be under control. Yet work in the modern economy is notable for its limitlessness. And if the stream of incoming emails is endless, Inbox Zero can never bring liberation: you’re still Sisyphus, rolling his boulder up that hill for all eternity – you’re just rolling it slightly faster.
Two years after his Google talk, Mann released a rambling and slightly manic online video in which he announced that he had signed a contract for an Inbox Zero book. But his career as a productivity guru had begun to stir an inner conflict. “I started making pretty good money from it” – from speaking and consulting – “but I also started to feel terrible,” he told me earlier this year. “This topic of productivity induces the worst kind of procrastination, because it feels like you’re doing work, but I was producing stuff that had the express purpose of saying to people, ‘Look, come and see how to do your work, rather than doing your work!’”
The book missed its publication date. Fans started asking questions. Then, after two more years, Mann published a self-lacerating essay in which he abruptly announced that he was jettisoning the project. It was the 3,000-word howl of a man who had suddenly grasped the irony of missing morning after morning with his three-year-old daughter because he was “typing bullshit that I hoped would please my book editor” about how to use time well. He was guilty, he declared, of “abandoning [my] priorities to write about priorities … I’ve unintentionally ignored my own counsel to never let your hard work fuck up the good things.” He hinted that he might write a different kind of book instead – a book about stuff that really mattered – but it never appeared. “I’m mostly out of the productivity racket these days,” Mann told me. “If you’re just using efficiency to jam more and more stuff into your day … well, how would you ever know that that’s working?”
It’s understandable that we respond to the ratcheting demands of modern life by trying to make ourselves more efficient. But what if all this efficiency just makes things worse?
Given that the average lifespan consists of only about 4,000 weeks, a certain amount of anxiety about using them well is presumably inevitable: we’ve been granted the mental capacities to make infinitely ambitious plans, yet almost no time at all to put them into practice. The problem of how to manage time, accordingly, goes back at least to the first century AD, when the Roman philosopher Seneca wrote On The Shortness of Life. “This space that has been granted to us rushes by so speedily, and so swiftly that all save a very few find life at an end just when they are getting ready to live,” he said, chiding his fellow citizens for wasting their days on pointless busyness, and “baking their bodies in the sun”.
Clearly, then, the challenge of how to live our lives well is not a new one. Still, it is safe to say that the citizens of first-century Rome didn’t experience the equivalent of today’s productivity panic. (Seneca’s answer to the question of how to live had nothing to do with becoming more productive: it was to give up the pursuit of wealth or high office, and spend your days philosophising instead.) What is uniquely modern about our fate is that we feel obliged to respond to the pressure of time by making ourselves as efficient as possible – even when doing so fails to bring the promised relief from stress.
The time-pressure problem was always supposed to get better as society advanced, not worse. In 1930, John Maynard Keynes famously predicted that within a century, economic growth would mean that we would be working no more than 15 hours per week – whereupon humanity would face its greatest challenge: that of figuring out how to use all those empty hours. Economists still argue about exactly why things turned out so differently, but the simplest answer is “capitalism”. Keynes seems to have assumed that we would naturally throttle down on work once our essential needs, plus a few extra desires, were satisfied. Instead, we just keep finding new things to need. Depending on your rung of the economic ladder, it’s either impossible, or at least usually feels impossible, to cut down on work in exchange for more time.
Arguably the first time management guru – the progenitor of the notion that personal productivity might be the answer to the problem of time pressure – was Frederick Winslow Taylor, an engineer hired in 1898 by the Bethlehem Steel Works, in Pennsylvania, with a mandate to improve the firm’s efficiency. “Staring out over an industrial yard that covered several square miles of the Pennsylvania landscape, he watched as labourers loaded 92lb [iron bars] on to rail cars,” writes Matthew Stewart, in his book The Management Myth. “There were 80,000 tons’ worth of iron bars, which were to be carted off as fast as possible to meet new demand sparked by the Spanish-American war. Taylor narrowed his eyes: there was waste here, he was certain.”
The Bethlehem workers, Taylor calculated, were shifting about 12.5 tons of iron per man per day – but predictably, when he offered a group of “large, powerful Hungarians” some extra cash to work as fast as they could for an hour, he found that they performed much better. Extrapolating to a full work day, and guesstimating time for breaks, Taylor concluded, with his trademark blend of self-confidence and woolly maths, that every man ought to be shifting 50 tons per day – four times their usual amount.
Workers were naturally unhappy at this transparent attempt to pay them the same money for more work, but Taylor was not especially concerned with their happiness; their job was to implement, not understand, his new philosophy of “scientific management”. “One of the very first requirements for a man who is fit to handle pig iron,” wrote Taylor, is “that he shall be so stupid and phlegmatic that he more nearly resembles in his mental makeup the ox than any other type … he is so stupid that the word ‘percentage’ has no meaning for him.”
The idea of efficiency that Taylor sought to impose on Bethlehem Steel was borrowed from the mechanical engineers of the industrial revolution. It was a way of thinking about improving the functioning of machines, now transferred to humans. And it caught on: Taylor enjoyed a high-profile career as a lecturer on the topic, and by 1915, according to the historian Jennifer Alexander, “the word ‘efficiency’ was plastered everywhere – in headlines, advertisements, editorials, business manuals, and church bulletins.” In the first decades of the 20th century, in a Britain panicked by the rise of German power, the National Efficiency movement united politicians on left and right. (“At the present time,” the Spectator noted in 1902, “there is a universal outcry for efficiency in all the departments of society, in all aspects of life.”)
It is not hard to grasp the appeal: efficiency was the promise of doing what you already did, only better, more cheaply, and in less time. What could be wrong with that? Unless you happened to be on the sharp end of attempts to treat humans like machines – like the workers of Bethlehem Steel – there wasn’t an obvious downside.
But as the century progressed, something important changed: we all became Frederick Winslow Taylors, presiding ruthlessly over our own lives. As the doctrine of efficiency grew entrenched – as the ethos of the market spread to more and more aspects of society, and life became more individualistic – we internalised it. In Taylor’s day, efficiency had been primarily a way to persuade (or bully) other people to do more work in the same amount of time; now it is a regimen that we impose on ourselves.
According to legend, Taylorism first crossed the threshold into personal productivity when Charles Schwab, the president of Bethlehem Steel, asked another consultant, a businessman named Ivy Lee, to improve his executives’ efficiency as well. Lee advised those white-collar workers to make nightly to-do lists, arranging tomorrow’s six most important tasks by priority, then to start at the top of the list next morning, working down. It’s a stretch to imagine that nobody had thought of this before. But the story goes that when Lee told Schwab to test it for three months, then pay him what he thought it was worth, the steel magnate wrote him a cheque worth more than $400,000 in today’s money – and the time management industry was up and running.
Other gurus were to follow, writing bestsellers that modified Lee’s basic technique to incorporate the setting of long-term goals (the 1973 book How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life, by Alan Lakein, who boasted of having advised both IBM and Gloria Steinem, and who inspired a young Bill Clinton) and spiritual values (The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, published in 1989 by the Mormon efficiency expert Stephen Covey).
Time management promised a sense of control in a world in which individuals – decreasingly supported by the social bonds of religion or community – seemed to lack it. In an era of insecure employment, we must constantly demonstrate our usefulness through frenetic doing, and time management can give you a valuable edge. Indeed, if you are among the growing ranks of the self-employed, as a freelancer or a worker in the so-called gig economy, increased personal efficiency may be essential to your survival. The only person who suffers financially if you indulge in “loafing” – a workplace vice that Taylor saw as theft – is you.
Above all, time management promises that a meaningful life might still be possible in this profit-driven environment, as Melissa Gregg explains in Counterproductive, a forthcoming history of the field. With the right techniques, the prophets of time management all implied, you could fashion a fulfilling life while simultaneously attending to the ever-increasing demands of your employer. This promise “comes back and back, in force, whenever there’s an economic downturn”, Gregg told me.
Especially at the higher-paid end of the employment spectrum, time management whispers of the possibility of something even more desirable: true peace of mind. “It is possible for a person to have an overwhelming number of things to do and still function productively with a clear head and a positive sense of relaxed control,” the contemporary king of the productivity gurus, David Allen, declared in his 2001 bestseller, Getting Things Done. “You can experience what the martial artists call a ‘mind like water’, and top athletes refer to as ‘the zone’.”
As Gregg points out, it is significant that “personal productivity” puts the burden of reconciling these demands squarely on our shoulders as individuals. Time management gurus rarely stop to ask whether the task of merely staying afloat in the modern economy – holding down a job, paying the mortgage, being a good-enough parent – really ought to require rendering ourselves inhumanly efficient in the first place.
Besides, on closer inspection, even the lesser promises of time management were not all they appeared to be. An awkward truth about Taylor’s celebrated efficiency drives is that they were not very successful: Bethlehem Steel fired him in 1901, having paid him vast sums without any clearly detectable impact on its own profits. (One persistent consequence of his schemes was that they seemed promising at first, but left workers too exhausted to function consistently over the long term.)
Likewise, it remains the frequent experience of those who try to follow the advice of personal productivity gurus – I’m speaking from years of experience here – that a “mind like water” is far from the guaranteed result. As with Inbox Zero, so with work in general: the more efficient you get at ploughing through your tasks, the faster new tasks seem to arrive. (“Work expands to fill the time available for its completion,” as the British historian C Northcote Parkinson realised way back in 1955, when he coined what would come to be known as Parkinson’s law.)
Then there’s the matter of self-consciousness: virtually every time management expert’s first piece of advice is to keep a detailed log of your time use, but doing so just heightens your awareness of the minutes ticking by, then lost for ever. As for focusing on your long-term goals: the more you do that, the more of your daily life you spend feeling vaguely despondent that you have not yet achieved them. Should you manage to achieve one, the satisfaction is strikingly brief – then it’s time to set a new long-term goal. The supposed cure just makes the problem worse.
There is a historical parallel for all this: it’s exactly what happened when the spread of “labour-saving” devices transformed the lives of housewives and domestic servants across Europe and north America from the end of the 19th century. Technology now meant that washing clothes no longer entailed a day bent over a mangle; a vacuum-cleaner could render a carpet spotless in minutes.
Yet as the historian Ruth Cowan demonstrates in her 1983 book More Work for Mother, the result, for much of the 20th century, was not an increase in leisure time among those charged with doing the housework. Instead, as the efficiency of housework increased, so did the standards of cleanliness and domestic order that society came to expect. Now that the living-room carpet could be kept perfectly clean, it had to be; now that clothes never needed to be grubby, grubbiness was all the more taboo. These days, you can answer work emails in bed at midnight. So should that message you got at 5.30pm really wait till morning for a reply?
One boiling weekend last summer, the impassioned members of a campaign group named Take Back Your Time gathered in a university lecture hall in Seattle, to further their longstanding mission of “eliminating the epidemic of overwork” – and, in so doing, to explore what it might mean to live a life that is not so focused on personal productivity. The 2016 Time Matters conference was a sparsely attended affair, in part because, as the organisers conceded, it was August, and lots of people were on holiday, and America’s most enthusiastically pro-relaxation organisation was hardly going to complain about that. But it was also because, these days, being even modestly anti-productivity – especially in the US – counts as a subversive stance. It is not the kind of platform that lends itself to glitzy mega-events with generous corporate sponsorship and effective marketing campaigns.
The conference-goers discussed schemes for a four-day working week, for abolishing daylight savings time, for holding elections at the weekend, and generally for making America more like countries such as Italy and Denmark. (To be a critic of America’s work culture is to constantly gaze longingly across the Atlantic, at semi-mythical versions of Scandinavia and southern Europe.) But the members of Take Back Your Time were calling for something more radical than merely more time off. They sought to question our whole instrumental attitude towards time – the very idea that “getting more done” ought to be our focus in the first place. “You keep hearing people arguing that more time off might be good for the economy,” said John de Graaf, the not-even-slightly-relaxed 70-year-old filmmaker who is the organisation’s driving force. “But why should we have to justify life in terms of the economy? It makes no sense!”
One of the sneakier pitfalls of an efficiency-based attitude to time is that we start to feel pressured to use our leisure time “productively”, too – an attitude which implies that enjoying leisure for its own sake, which you might have assumed was the whole point of leisure, is somehow not quite enough. And so we find ourselves, for example, travelling to unfamiliar places not for the sheer experience of travel, but in order to add to our mental storehouse of experiences, or to our Instagram feeds. We go walking or running to improve our health, not for the pleasure of movement; we approach the tasks of parenthood with a fixation on the successful future adults we hope to create.
In his 1962 book The Decline of Pleasure, the critic Walter Kerr noticed this shift in our experience of time: “We are all of us compelled to read for profit, party for contracts, lunch for contacts … and stay home for the weekend to rebuild the house.” Even rest and recreation, in a culture preoccupied with efficiency, can only be understood as valuable insofar as they are useful for some other purpose – usually, recuperation, so as to enable more work. (Several conference guests mentioned Arianna Huffington’s current crusade to encourage people to get more sleep; for her, it seems, the main point of rest is to excel at the office.)
If all this increased efficiency brings none of the benefits it was supposed to bring, what should we be doing instead? At Take Back Your Time, the consensus was that personal lifestyle changes would never suffice: reform would have to start with policies on vacation, maternity leave and overtime. But in the meantime, we might try to get more comfortable with not being as efficient as possible – with declining certain opportunities, disappointing certain people, and letting certain tasks go undone. Plenty of unpleasant chores are essential to survival. But others are not – we have just been conditioned to assume that they are. It isn’t compulsory to earn more money, achieve more goals, realise our potential on every dimension, or fit more in. In a quiet moment in Seattle, Robert Levine, a social psychologist from California, quoted the environmentalist Edward Abbey: “Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell.”
Yet if the ethos of efficiency and productivity risks prioritising the health of the economy over the happiness of humans, it is also true that the sense of pressure it fosters is not much good for business, either. This, it turns out, is a lesson business is not especially keen to learn.
“After years of consulting with Microsoft, I was suddenly persona non grata,” Tom DeMarco told me, with a note of amusement in his voice. DeMarco is a minor legend in the world of software engineering. He began his career at Bell Telephone Labs, birthplace of the laser and transistor, and later became an expert in managing complex software projects, a field notorious for spiralling costs, missed deadlines, and clashing egos. But then, in the 1980s, he committed heresy: he started arguing that ramping up the time pressure on your employees was a terrible way to drive such projects forward. What was needed, he had come to realise, was not an increased focus on using time efficiently. It was the opposite: more slack.
“The best companies I visited, all through the years, were never very hurried,” DeMarco said. “Maybe they used pressure from time to time, as a sort of amusing side-effect. But it was never a constant. Because you don’t get creativity for free. You need people to be able to sit back, put their feet up, and think.” Manual work can be speeded up, at least to a certain extent, by increasing the time pressure on workers. But good ideas do not emerge more rapidly when people feel under the gun – if anything, the good ideas dry up.
Part of the problem is simply that thinking about time encourages clockwatching, which has been repeatedly shown in studies to undermine the quality of work. In one representative experiment from 2008, US researchers asked people to complete the Iowa gambling task, a venerable decision-making test that involves selecting playing cards in order to win a modest amount of cash. All participants were given the same time in which to complete the task – but some were told that time would probably be sufficient, while others were warned it would be tight. Contrary to an intuition cherished especially among journalists – that the pressure of deadlines is what forces them to produce high-quality work – the second group performed far less well. The mere awareness of their limited time triggered anxious emotions that got in the way of performance.
But worse perils await. DeMarco points out that any increase in efficiency, in an organisation or an individual life, necessitates a trade-off: you get rid of unused expanses of time, but you also get rid of the benefits of that extra time. A visit to your family doctor provides an obvious example. The more efficiently they manage their time, the fuller their schedule will be – and the more likely it is that you will be kept sitting in the waiting room when an earlier appointment overruns. (That’s all a queue is, after all: the cost of someone else’s efficiency, being shouldered by you.) In the accident and emergency department, by contrast, remaining “inefficient” in this sense is a matter of life and death. If there is an exclusive focus on using the staff’s time as efficiently as possible, the result will be a department too busy to accommodate unpredictable arrivals, which are the whole reason it exists.
A similar problem afflicts any corporate cost-cutting exercise that focuses on maximising employees’ efficiency: the more of their hours that are put to productive use, the less available they will be to respond, on the spur of the moment, to critical new demands. For that kind of responsiveness, idle time must be built into the system.
“An organisation that can accelerate but not change direction is like a car that can speed up but not steer,” DeMarco writes. “In the short run, it makes lots of progress in whatever direction it happened to be going. In the long run, it’s just another road wreck.” He often uses the analogy of those sliding number puzzles, in which you move eight tiles around a nine-tile grid, until all the digits are in order. To use the available space more efficiently, you could always add a ninth tile to the empty square. You just wouldn’t be able to solve the puzzle any more. If that jammed and unsolvable puzzle feels like an appropriate metaphor for your life, it’s hard to see how improving your personal efficiency – trying to force yet more tiles on to the grid – is going to be much help.
At the very bottom of our anxious urge to manage time better – the urge driving Frederick Winslow Taylor, Merlin Mann, me and perhaps you – it’s not hard to discern a familiar motive: the fear of death. As the philosopher Thomas Nagel has put it, on any meaningful timescale other than human life itself – that of the planet, say, or the cosmos – “we will all be dead any minute”. No wonder we are so drawn to the problem of how to make better use of our days: if we could solve it, we could avoid the feeling, in Seneca’s words, of finding life at an end just when we were getting ready to live. To die with the sense of nothing left undone: it’s nothing less than the promise of immortality by other means.
But the modern zeal for personal productivity, rooted in Taylor’s philosophy of efficiency, takes things several significant steps further. If only we could find the right techniques and apply enough self-discipline, it suggests, we could know that we were fitting everything important in, and could feel happy at last. It is up to us – indeed, it is our obligation – to maximise our productivity. This is a convenient ideology from the point of view of those who stand to profit from our working harder, and our increased capacity for consumer spending. But it also functions as a form of psychological avoidance. The more you can convince yourself that you need never make difficult choices – because there will be enough time for everything – the less you will feel obliged to ask yourself whether the life you are choosing is the right one.
Personal productivity presents itself as an antidote to busyness when it might better be understood as yet another form of busyness. And as such, it serves the same psychological role that busyness has always served: to keep us sufficiently distracted that we don’t have to ask ourselves potentially terrifying questions about how we are spending our days. “How we labour at our daily work more ardently and thoughtlessly than is necessary to sustain our life because it is even more necessary not to have leisure to stop and think,” wrote Friedrich Nietzsche, in what reads like a foreshadowing of our present circumstances. “Haste is universal because everyone is in flight from himself.”
You can seek to impose order on your inbox all you like – but eventually you’ll need to confront the fact that the deluge of messages, and the urge you feel to get them all dealt with, aren’t really about technology. They’re manifestations of larger, more personal dilemmas. Which paths will you pursue, and which will you abandon? Which relationships will you prioritise, during your shockingly limited lifespan, and who will you resign yourself to disappointing? What matters?
For Merlin Mann, consciously confronting these questions was a matter of realising that people would always be making more claims on his time – worthy claims, too, for the most part – than it would be possible for him to meet. And that even the best, most efficient system for managing the emails they sent him was never going to provide a solution to that. “Eventually, I realised something,” he told me. “Email is not a technical problem. It’s a people problem. And you can’t fix people.”

By midday, Soni Mishra* has taken off her dupatta (scarf), wiped the makeup off her sweaty face, and phoned her husband twice to make sure he can collect their son from school. Mishra, along with at least a dozen other women, has been queuing for two hours in baking heat at a Dena Bank branch in Mumbai, hoping to deposit a bundle of cash she has brought with her.
For the past 15 years, Mishra, a housewife, has been saving for a rainy day. “Every month, my husband gives me some money for the household expenses. I spend most of it, but I save a few rupees in case of an emergency. I save for my son’s education, for his future. My husband also saves, of course, but I save so I have my own money in case there’s a problem in my life.”
Mishra wants to deposit her 500 and 1,000 rupee (£11.91) notes at the bank, before 30 December. In an effort to crack down on corruption, tax evasion and black markets, the prime minister, Narendra Modi, announced last month that the high-value banknotes, which account for roughly 80% of the total cash in circulation in India, were to be withdrawn. However, the notes can be banked before the year-end deadline.
In India, millions of women like Mishra keep bundles of cash stashed away in hidden biscuit tins or tupperware, under sinks, or at the back of wardrobes. Some collect tens of thousands of rupees over the years, hoping to pitch in for their children’s weddings or education, or save for old age.
“Every woman saves,” Mishra says. “You never know what problems you’re going to have, and we all keep money in the house, in a safe or in a box hidden somewhere. It’s a security for a woman. Because of this announcement, I now feel very insecure.”
Though they have large amounts of money, women are kept out of the banking system. Roughly 80% of Indian women don’t have a bank account. Culturally, managing the household income is seen as a male preserve, so accounts tend to be in the man’s name and the vast majority of women aren’t involved in making big financial decisions.
With the cash crackdown, women’s savings are at risk. Many will have to hand their money to their husbands to deposit in a bank. If their savings exceed 2.5 lakh rupees (£2,950), they will have to pay a 45% tax, and a penalty of up to 200% if the bank finds an income mismatch. With little access to reliable information, and little experience of the banking system, women nationwide have been thrown into panic by Modi’s announcement.
The Gauravi women’s crisis centre in Bhopal, a city in central India, received more than 200 requests for help in five days from women with currency problems. “Unfortunately, a lot of the women who come here don’t have bank accounts, and many of them don’t have information about what to do now,” says Shivani Saini, coordinator at the centre.
“Many of them are not allowed to watch TV, so they don’t know what Modi has said. Many think they can only deposit their cash at the banks near their childhood homes – they don’t know that you can go to any bank and deposit cash. Now, their husbands are scaring them, saying, ‘Why did you hide so much money from me? The police are going to come and catch you.’”
At least two women who came to the crisis centre had been beaten and thrown out of their homes for hiding money from their husbands. “The moment they reveal to their husbands that they have cash saved up, the husbands start pressuring them to hand it over. One woman came here with six children at 6am. She had been kicked out for lying to her husband and she had nowhere else to go. In desperation, women are selling their 1,000 and 500 rupee notes cheap, accepting 800 rupees or 300 rupees in exchange.
“I’d say 100% of women in this area save cash, and especially migrant women, who have come to this region after being married off. They can’t even go back to their parents house if there’s some difficulty,” Saini says. “Women can’t join six-hour queues. Nobody else is going to cook food on their behalf. This is a very disheartening decision for women.”
Priyanka Bhatia, founder of Women on Wealth, which helps women manage their finances and start businesses, says women are bearing the brunt of the demonetisation announcement. “People are taking advantage of women because they know they have no choice but to buy food for their house or books for their kids. Nobody’s giving change for a 500 or 1,000 rupee note.
“We usually advise women to save, so they can use that capital to start a business or achieve personal goals, but now they feel their savings are worthless.”

The Vagina Dispatches asked you for your drawings, and we got plenty – ranging from the requested vulvas to penises to cars. Here’s what we learned
Three weeks ago, I euthanised my 27-year-old horse, Cheque. We’d been together since I was 14 and he was – and remains – my special horse: the one I would ride anywhere and trust with anyone; the one whose moods I could read with a glance. I miss seeing him in my paddock; I miss kissing his nose and how he ate his apples, one tiny bite at a time.
The grief associated with losing an animal is a type of disenfranchised grief, one that is not acknowledged broadly; a grief that is too often borne in silence. But the depth of a relationship between a family and their pet is deep and complex; animals become part of the fabric of our lives. They improve our mental health and general wellbeing. They are company for the lonely, and a comfort to the distressed.
The complexity of this relationship is rarely apparent from the outside; full of tiny moments that build up – as they do between people – into something rich and meaningful. And this is reflected in the various ways people cope with and grieve the loss of their pets.
When I realised the grief associated with the death of a pet is rarely spoken about, I decided to ask for people’s thoughts and experiences of losing their pets. What helped them while they were grieving? The response was overwhelming. In 24 hours, I received more than a hundred responses. Patterns quickly emerged; methods that helped people cope, and things people struggled with, often in silence.
Many people who responded said they were comforted by having their pet’s remains or possessions close to them. A friend of mine, Kim, lost her beloved chihuahua, Paris, more than a year ago. Afterwards, Kim had her cremated and carries some of Paris’s ashes with her in a locket.
In fact, there’s an entire industry devoted to helping people create mementoes of your pets when they die. When my mother’s horse died suddenly seven years ago, I found a small business online that would create jewellery and key rings out of your horse’s mane. My mother still carries it with her. Similarly, animal rescuer Bec wore her dog’s collars on her wrist as a bracelet until the ashes came home; she also has photos of her departed pets – three dogs and a budgie – in a locket she always wears.
Sarah, another animal rescuer, talked about the pain of losing her dog. “I couldn’t move,” she said. “I couldn’t get up. I could barely eat or drink. It was the worst, most unbearable pain I had experienced in my life.” She still keeps his ashes on her bedside table.
I asked Kelsey, a vet nurse from Melbourne, what people do with their animals after their death. “Many of our clients will request a cremation service or to take their pets home with them, rather than an organised burial,” she said. Interestingly, Kelsey also noted people often visit a different clinic to their regular one when it comes time to euthanise their pet.
Many people want to tell stories and share memories of their pet when they die. They reach out for comfort. Wikum, a friend of mine, spoke of how confronting it had been watching his family’s dog die in their living room, while his family gathered to pray. He found his belief in reincarnation helped him through the awful time and that, while devastating, he was grateful they were all there and able to soothe their dog’s passing.
The grief associated with the death of a pet can become even more complicated when we make the decision to put them down. For many of us, deciding when to euthanise a pet is the only time we are confronted with a life-or-death decision. This decision is compounded by the fact that we cannot ask them what they want; we make the choice entirely on our own, and the responsibility and guilt of it can be crushing.
The number of responses I received – including photos of dead animals, graves and ashes – seems to indicate people don’t have adequate avenues to express their grief. While animals are accepted as being a part of the family, there is still an overwhelming perception their loss is not a truly valid grief. People talked about guilt and stigma – with many feeling uncomfortable asking for time off work, even though they felt they needed it. Even more explained they did not feel properly supported by the people around them. Most of all, people appreciated empathy – an understanding their grief was real and normal.
Interestingly, the varied and individual nature of the responses demonstrates we don’t really have defined traditions associated with the death of a pet in our society. While some people craved distance, others craved closeness with their pet’s remains. People dealt with their grief with tattoos – sometimes of a paw print taken at their veterinary clinic – and photos; with ashes and antidepressants; with work and with family. While we often follow traditions associated with the death of a relative, it seems responding to a pet’s death is much more varied.
More than 5 million households in Australia have a pet, to say nothing of the rest of the world – but we still have a way to go in how we deal with the grief of losing them.
Penelope Stanford does her female ancestors a disservice in claiming that australopithecine “females [had] little agency in the selection of mates” (Polygynous apes may explain men of today, Letters, 20 December). A species in which female choice did not underpin mate selection, as it does in practically all animal species, would deteriorate rapidly under the enfeebling influence of mediocre male genes. She is right that polygynous species mean many males with no partners – our own genetic record shows far fewer fathers than mothers in any individual’s ancestry – and that males will fight each other for reproductive privileges.
But any Palaeolithic proto-human female would never want her own offspring to end her genetic line – and feeble sons have little chance of gaining reproductive privileges against tougher males. Her solution is to choose males who prove themselves capable of dominating other males, so that her sons will do the same in the next generation. Polygamy is an excellent solution for females to the perennial problem of too few high-quality males. It may not be a nice ancestry, I agree, but would she say this explains a lot about the behaviour of some females nowadays? I would be surprised.

• Yes, polygynous apes may explain men of today. But in the past there were solutions to the problem of surplus males: the navy, the army and the monasteries. Today they are sent into politics.

In Cannes in May 2014 I was having supper with some colleagues when in walked Robin Williams, done up as Mrs Doubtfire. Was it really the great man? There’d been rumours of a sequel; perhaps Williams was in town anyway for the film festival and doing a little immersive research. Up close, everything looked convincing: brooch, bouffant, pinny. It was only the heavy French accent that eventually gave the game away. That and the outstretched hat for euros.
Still, it was a fun encounter. It was less fun the following year, when Mrs D trotted in again to the same restaurant, cap in hand, nine months after Williams had killed himself. There were shudders, mixed with grudging respect at the gumption.
I had a similar sensation last week, when Peter Cushing (who died in 1994) popped up in the new Star Wars movie, Rogue One. Such an appearance had been reported for more than a year, but it was still a morbid thrill to see how they’d pulled it off, particularly given the “slipper” issue.
Shooting the first movie back in 1977, Cushing had objected to his ill-fitting galactic imperial officer riding boots, so George Lucas let him slum about in moccasins. The resulting lack of footage of Cushing from the knees down was apparently the biggest stumbling block for this year’s CGI resurrectors. For the rest of him, they wheeled on a Holby City actor with similar cheekbones then digitally stuck old bits of face on top.
Does it work? Remarkably well. Grand Moff’s dialogue doesn’t seem entirely synchronised, and that’s an alarmingly waxy pallor – but it’s a huge leap forward from the shoot-him-from-the-back technique employed in 2014’s Fast & Furious 7, when the late Paul Walker’s brothers acted as stand-ins. And, especially, the notorious 2000 episode of The Sopranos in which the late Nancy Marchand’s head, speaking fairly random lines from outtakes, was wobblily lodged on someone else’s body.
Yet public reaction to the Cushing comeback has been more sceptical than I anticipated. (Sample tweet: “Mmm, girl, you must be CGI Peter Cushing because you can’t make eye contact and you’re confusing my children.”) And, much as this backlash is harsh on the techies, it’s also encouraging. Perhaps we’re witnessing the first setback for that nascent industry that aims to keep us going digitally long after we’ve snuffed it. Not just movie stars: new site eterni.me repurposes your emails and text messages so that grieving relatives can converse with a chatbot doing an algorithmically generated impression of you.
Yet the reduction of the soul to regurgitated digital correspondence does not seem to me something a lot of people would like. And though Cushing’s estate approved his use in Rogue One, I’m not convinced that if I had built up a formidable acting career, I’d then want to turn in a performance I had bupkis to do with.
The people who are actually driving this form of immortality are the living, whether to cope with their own loss or negotiate problematic plot-holes. Access to such tools will soon be devolved further. If it’s possible for loved ones to bridge the great beyond by feeding old emails into a machine, why not complete strangers with access to our Twitter feed?
But there’s a deeper unease too, as testified by the fact that Cushing’s comeback was so well done. This suggests the problem is not quality of execution but simple concept. Jesus aside, resurrection has been primarily employed by fiction which seeks to unsettle. The power of Christianity derives in large part from that final-reel twist. The power of a lot of horror comes from the subversion of the natural order.
The dignity of death ought to be preserved. This may require us to do what Robin Williams did and place the rights to our likeness in a trust for 25 years – by which time, hopefully, no one will want to dust us off. If Mrs Doubtfire 2 does happen, starring a version of Williams yet more convincing than that French impersonator, at least we have until 2039 to prepare ourselves.
In the great tradition of this newspaper ruining Christmas by being miserable about it, let me guide you through how to be a total grinch.
I probably started on 2 December, because friends had started posting pictures of their trees online. What? Christmas now lasts six weeks? Christmas, like childbirth, should take just one day. Their pathetic excuses this year were about everything being terrible, a time of profound public and political loss, and they were just trying to make everything better. This is some self-deluding nonsense, as if facism can be fought with fairy lights. I got over myself, though, and bought a poinsettia. Shame it’s already dead.
No one needs all these presents, but the real trick is to simultaneously decry the instruction to go all crafty and handmade. Who has the time to whittle baubles out of wheatgrass? My personal beef, or the vegan equivalent of it, is the insanity of the stocking filler. A clementine and a bag of chocolate money no longer suffices. It’s now all very expensive crud. Death to all petal- and glitter-encrusted bath bombs!
Did you know that the average Christmas dinner contains 8,000 calories? Obviously. That is the entire point if it. Did you know A&E departments are full of people who have done daft things after drinking too much? Is it sensible to put a lot of people who don’t really like each other (relatives) into a small space and fuel them with booze and other flammable humans? No. Act like you have recently discovered this information.
People die at Christmas. People who are ill are still ill at Christmas. Every Christmas, people think a lot about those they have lost and it’s a very difficult time for them. I find it is helpful to go round announcing your personal insights about grief and to try to get into some sort of competition about it. Likewise, if you hear any bad news at all, join in the general chorus that it is even worse than it already is because it is late December.
We are suffering an epidemic of loneliness and it is fairly easy to invite anyone who is alone to come over at any point during the year, surely? Loneliness is long-term. Christmas is the time to bring home all kinds of failure: bad relationships, unwanted childlessness, separation – every imperfection can be amplified. I read some advice that said: “Avoid excessive rumination about your life.” Isn’t that what being under siege with your family is for?
Basically, everyone wants the crappy meal they had as children. No one actively wants almonds in their sprouts. Or random star anise in surprise places. Celebrity cooks may spend weeks “brining” – that is their problem. Likewise, making your own “nibbles” or indeed even saying the word “nibbles” is deranged. If something isn’t a cheese straw, no one cares. The continual reinvention of the edible wheel is a huge faff that falls mostly to sweaty and stressed women.
You didn’t think I could get this far without saying that Christmas is essentially an anti-feminist conspiracy celebrating virgin births and stale, pale patriarchs, did you?
Do this while tweeting pictures of your family’s heirloom Christmas decorations. Your Christmas should be both the same as everyone else’s and superior to it. This is what social media is for.
Insist on the real meaning of Christmas and whinge about how we have lost it, but without specifying what that meaning is. Just say that it is all the fault of neoliberalism. No one will know what you mean, but they will agree with you.
The whole point of being a grinch is that you lower expectations dramatically. It is neither iconoclastic nor interesting to not like Christmas, but ambivalence is normal. Your friends and family will actively enjoy teasing you about it and in face of the moronic cheerleading everywhere, standards of ill-will have to be maintained.
The one where I had to physically throw my friend’s sister out of the house after she slapped her; the one where we had “a compulsory buffet” in Cambodia; the one where my dying mother had a morphine syringe driver and kept thinking Prince Charles was in the room. The OK ones blur into one. So, the best you can aim for is maximal blur.
Don’t follow recipes. The best approach to gravy is a “free your mind and your ass will follow” one. Same with religion.
If the smash-and-grab jollity gets too much, have a nap and remember: most of us never attain the perfect Christmas. Muddling through is good enough. I hope you do. One and all.
Christmas is a strange time of the year, when people merrily do all sorts of bizarre things. Try explaining to a judge in June that you were allowed to kiss somebody without warning because there was a parasitic shrub hanging from the ceiling, and call me when you’re on the register. But, just as often, people confidently claim that they know exactly why they are doing them.
How many times have you heard somebody say: “You know it’s all pagan, of course?”, as though the barely recorded history of pagan activities in north-west Europe was something they happen to be terribly familiar with. Trees? Trees are pagan, don’t you know? No. Trees are just there. They’re trees and there’s nothing pagan about them.
The truth is, we usually have no idea of the origin of these curious traditions. So here, as a public service, are 10 myths of Christmas.
This is one you always hear at dinner parties. It makes the speaker sound rather clever and cynical. Except it’s tosh. Coca-Cola did start using Santa in advertising in 1933. But Santa had been portrayed almost exclusively in red from the early 19th century and most of his modern image was put together by cartoonist Thomas Nast in the 1870s. Even if you were to confine your search to Santa in American soft drinks adverts, you would find a thoroughly modern Santa Claus in the posters for White Rock that came out in 1923.
Except it’s not. Jingle Bells was written by James Pierpont in 1857. Pierpont was American and the song (originally called One Horse Open Sleigh) is about Thanksgiving, and about winter fun and frolics more generally. How un-Christmassy it is can be gleaned from the other verses, which never make it into a British carol concert. Verse two goes like this:
A day or two ago
I tho’t I’d take a ride
And soon Miss Fannie Bright
Was seated by my side.
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank
And we – we got upsot.
No, it doesn’t. Matthew 2:1 tells us that “when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem”. Did you notice the word “three”? Nor did I. They brought gifts with them: “they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh”; yet the Bible never says how many magi there were, only that they were plural. There could have been two or 200. Magi, by the way, were Zoroastrians. There were believed to be well-versed in mysterious arts, hence our modern word “magic”.
Saturnalia was originally held on 17 December. Later it was expanded until it lasted all the way up to 23 December. But it never shared a date with Christmas. There was a Roman festival on 25 December, the festival of Sol Invictus. But there were Roman festivals on most days of the year (more than 200 of them) and Sol Invictus is not recorded before Christmas and neither it nor Saturnalia have much in common with it.
That name is only three words long and there are two problems with it. Though Wenceslas existed, he wasn’t a king and he wasn’t called Wenceslas. His name was Vaclav and he was duke, not king, of Bohemia (in the modern-day Czech Republic) in the 10th century. He may have been good. However, it’s equally likely that people looked back on him with rose-tinted glasses after he was succeeded by his brother, Boleslaus the Cruel. Boleslaus really earned his name, not least by killing Vaclav to take the throne. Soon, legends of Vaclav’s goodness had grown so popular that he was posthumously declared king by Otto the Great.
The story goes that after the Norse god Baldr was killed by an arrow made of mistletoe, his mother, the unfortunately named goddess Frigg, swore that the plant should never harm anybody else and that instead it should encourage kissing. This, though, isn’t found anywhere in Norse mythology. Well, the mistletoe arrow is, but Frigg’s response has nothing to do with kissing and everything to do with torturing Baldr’s killer for all eternity. Mistletoe is an English tradition. It seems to have been little-known in 1719, when Sir John Colebatch wrote a whole book on the plant and the customs associated with it. But it was well-known enough in 1786 to appear in a popular song from the now-forgotten musical Two to One.
There’s nothing in the Bible about the date of Jesus’s birth, but the earliest calculation, made in the second century, reckoned it was in March. So we’re nine months late on the whole.
That’s not the first line of the hymn; that’s not even a line of the hymn, at least according to the man who wrote it. Charles Wesley wrote a hymn that began “Hark how all the welkin rings/Glory to the king of kings”. Another preacher called George Whitefield then published a version with the line we all know now. Wesley responded by saying that people were welcome to republish his hymns “provided they print them just as they are. But I desire they would not attempt to mend them; for they really are not able.”
Advent begins on the nearest Sunday to St Andrew’s Day on the 30 November. So, this year, Advent began on 27 November. The idea that it starts on the same day every year was put about by the manufacturers of Advent calendars, so that they could use the same design each year and sell off old stock.
This one would have surprised Queen Victoria, who had a Christmas tree as a child. So did the sizeable German immigrant population in Manchester in the early 19th century. Victoria and Albert popularised the Christmas tree when they were pictured with one in the Illustrated London News in 1848.
There was one Christmas tree recorded in England in 1444, but nobody knows what it was doing there.

Submissions for the Great Wall of Vulvas will close down on 31 December. Add your vulva drawing before the year comes to a close.
We were prepared for the penises. We were ready for the onslaught of offensive, hand-drawn internet memes. The Volvos came as a surprise.
We created the Great Wall of Vulvas to accompany the Vagina Dispatches, the Guardian video series on women’s health. The first episode focused on the question: “What does the vulva even look like?” According to one survey, only half of women aged 26-35 were able to label the vagina accurately. As one person featured in the video said: “How can [women] be in charge of their bodies if they don’t even know what they’re called?”
If they’ve seen them at all, some people have only seen vaginas and vulvas depicted clinically as pink medical diagrams in health textbooks, while penises are frequently found carved into the very desk the textbook sits on (not to mention scrawled on bathroom stalls, tagged on lockers, drawn in snow …).
As Dr Hilda Hutcherson said in episode one, no two vulvas look exactly the same. So we set out to prove it, by creating the world’s largest collection of vulva drawings. We wanted vulvas to be seen, and to be seen en masse. Inspiration came from a few sources:
The vulvas did not go straight from the digital pen to the wall. After the wall went live, the Guardian US interactive team spent the entire weekend swiping through vulva after vulva after penis after vulva, and making sure only the vulvas came through. And we’ve been examining the incoming vulvas daily since then.
We were impressed that the great majority of submissions were correctly drawn vulvas, rather than the health-textbook diagram of the vagina, which also resembles the logo for the Dodge Ram. But another car found its way into the project.
One hundred and three people felt pretty darn clever. They thought: “You know what vulva sounds like? I bet nobody thought of that …” So, in honor of the 103 people who used to sit in the back of their classrooms and crack jokes, The Small Wall of Volvos. Good joke.
With boxy vehicles out of the way, we could return to our initial investigation: what does a normal vulva look like? Some 21,000 vulva drawings later, we were pleased to confirm that there isn’t one. Submitted drawings varied in size, shape and color. There were tiny labia and long ones. Expansive and shorn pubic hair. 
Drawings did tend to break down into two points of view. More frequently, it was the view of concentric ovals one can only see on oneself with a hand mirror. But there were also many W-shaped front views, like the cup, which has often been a symbol for the vagina.
They captured the undulating natural curves of vulvas, and some used negative space masterfully, or as masterfully as pixel art can be. Importantly, they weren’t cars.
The Vagina Dispatches asked you for your drawings, and we got plenty – ranging from the requested vulvas to penises to cars. Here’s what we learned
As I write, 30 house sparrows are scrapping over the feeder outside my kitchen door. There are great tits in the smoke bush over the back fence to the end of my garden – I haven’t seen them come in yet, but I have seen a blue tit, a robin and a goldfinch, so there’s a good chance the great tits are coming in too. It will be a while before my garden is mature enough to provide shelter for these species, but the fact that they’re tentatively popping in for a sunflower heart now and then is a Big Deal.
This time last year I was still removing decking and weed-suppressant membrane, creating huge piles of stones which I would later use to make paths and edge my pond. On the last Saturday before Christmas I used some of the decking to make a planter, in which I added used compost, kitchen waste and manure, and created a sad display of hellebores, Japanese anemones and herb robert – a combination of plants I’d brought with me from my previous garden and those I’d found growing against the odds in lumps of moss in the decking. All my friends were at Christmas parties, proudly displaying their silly jumpers on Facebook, I was in the garden keeping the woodlice company.
At times, over the last year, I felt I’d bitten off more than I could chew. Every piece of decking had to be taken through the flat, the long pieces carried through the front window. I gathered stones into buckets by hand, moving them from one place to the next as I started to dig the soil and bury the roots of plants, of promise. Recently I looked back at photos of the garden over the last year; in April it was still a huge muddy mess.
Now I have a lawn (or a semblance of one – half of it is brown because I laid the turf too late), I have herbaceous borders ready to burst into life again next year, cuttings of this and that finally bulking up, seedlings of hardy annuals ready to fill spaces. I have native shrubs to attract moths and butterflies, which I hope will lay the eggs of the bottom of the food chain for other animals to come and eat. I’ve erected trellis to add height to the walls and provide more space for my climbing roses and clematis to grow.
I’ve counted 15 species of bee, red and blue damselflies, the common darter dragonfly, three or four species of moth and just five of butterfly (it has been a terrible year for them). I’ve found other creatures such as froghopper, the broad centurion fly and whirligig beetle – all common species, but they were absent before I took the decking up. There are still millions of woodlice.
It’s incredible how quickly plants grow and the wildlife finds them. And I have every confidence there will be more growth, and more wildlife, in 2017. Once the climbers have grown into the trellis, the birds will no longer have to take shelter in neighbouring gardens when they come to mine to feed, so I should expect to see more bird life.
Three leafcutter bees attempted to nest this year but failed – I don’t know why. But between them they laid one egg, which turned into a grub and is now a healthy cocoon housing a fully grown bee. It’s probably a female – they tend to be laid first, at the back of the nest, where they’re safer. Could she start a new generation of leafcutters in my garden? I’m keeping her safe in her bee hotel in my shed, along with the wool carder and red mason bee cocoons. Here they are kept dry, away from rain as well as predators. I’ll put them out again in spring and cross everything for a warm, sunny summer.
My pond still hasn’t filled up, but it doesn’t matter. On mild days I still see pond snails and whirligig beetles on the surface; common darter nymphs no doubt prowl the bottom. I’ll be lucky to get frogspawn, but you never know what’s out there.
I hope the house sparrows will stop ignoring the nest boxes I put up for them, to have them raising young in my garden would be a dream.
So it’s done, the borders are full, the habitats created. It just needs a healthy dose of sunshine and some time. As a gardener I will continue to prune, to shape, to help things along and weed things out where necessary - play God, if you like. But I will also take cuttings and collect seed to pass on to friends and neighbours. Anything to keep the plants growing, to keep the momentum going, to keep greening these grey, lifeless patches of Britain.
I’ve always privately thought that the two most liberating products to have been invented in the 20th century are dry shampoo and Febreze, but perhaps I’m just a slob. A society of people freed from the tyranny of washing their hair and clothes in an endless, predictable cycle until they expire is just the kind of utopia I can get on board with.
Clearly other women feel the same, because the UK market for shampoo and conditioner has dropped by £23m over the past year. Some have blamed this on slovenly freelancers such as myself, and there may be something in that. Working from home is a peculiar endeavour that sees time mysteriously sucked into a vortex of Homes Under the Hammer and endless cups of tea. You had intended to spruce yourself up a bit but, before you know it, it’s 5pm and – although there’s a shirt on your top half to make you look presentable for that Skype meeting – your bottom half bears a pair of penguin pyjama bottoms (which is fine, as long as you don’t forget and stand up to fetch something mid conference call, as happened to a friend of mine). Somehow – and despite having contributed precisely nada to the country’s gross domestic product – the window you had designated for that quick shower was slammed shut many hours ago.
This is how I ended up being the kind of woman whose mother frequently asks if she is intending on brushing her hair today. Perhaps, privately, people think I have let myself go, not that I give a toss. You don’t have to buy into Naomi Wolf’s theory in The Beauty Myth that the grooming industry ramped up a notch just as women were liberating themselves from the home, so that the patriarchy could keep us subjugated with the expensive, time-consuming and tedious whims of female grooming.
Around my mid-20s, I discovered feminism and, more importantly, came to the realisation that not only can you not polish a turd, but that rolling it in glitter takes ages and costs a bomb. Suddenly, the swizz was exposed: my hair looked the same – middling – whether I washed it with 99p own-brand apple shampoo or the really pricey stuff. There’s a cliche that women let themselves go as soon as they have a ring on their finger, but my descent into slovenliness long predates that happy occurrence.
I wasn’t always like this. Ten years ago, it was fake eyelashes, fake tan, fake cleavage. I wore heels all the time. Drag queens complimented me on my beehive. Then I moved south and began to dress – as one of my northern friends put it – as if I had crawled out of a bin. The watershed moment was when she came to visit and put her hair in rollers and dug out a cocktail dress in order to go to the pub. “Aren’t you going to get changed?” she asked, looking me up and down with disdain. I was not.
So, I would hazard that the majority of us dirty-haired slatterns are based down south. Slowly letting yourself go isn’t really an acceptable project to take on up north. My mum has recently moved back after several years in London. “The girls all seem to have shaved their eyebrows off and painted them back on,” she reported, “I don’t understand it. Does it come from pornography?”
Leaving aside whatever niche eyebrow-based porn my mother might imagine pollutes the internet, phenomena such as the “scouse brow” owe much to the fact that so many of us live our lives online these days. The Kardashian look of waist training and contouring is genuinely laborious, but can be deceptive in its transformative potential (if there isn’t a word for a person who only looks buff on social media, then there definitely should be). Refusing to participate can be a feminist statement against objectification, but it also puts you on more of the same level as men, for whom I’ve always felt sorry in the sense that, if you’re unattractive, you really have nowhere to hide. Unless you’re David Bowie reincarnated, the possibilities for transformation are limited to short back and sides.
Let’s not kid ourselves, then, that we are in the grips of an overwhelming beauty backlash. For every one of us who has realised that having a fringe means only needing to put foundation on half your face and never needing to do your eyebrows, there’s another woman trapped in the death grip of the YouTube beauty tutorial. And that is her choice. I don’t think caring about it is stupid or shallow. Women who love fashion and beauty always have this charge levied at them, while men who are obsessed with cars, sport or power tools are somehow lent a certain gravitas. It’s just not for me. And I’m amazed how much time I now have on my unmanicured hands.
Restrictive practices by the trade body representing owners of fairground rides has left funfairs with fewer new attractions, the competition regulator has claimed.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Wednesday that the law may have been breached by rules enforced by a trade body in the travelling fair sector, the Showmen’s Guild of Great Britain.
Ann Pope, a senior antitrust director at the CMA, said: “These allegations concern the use of restrictive rules which could limit competition between funfairs and effectively prevent non-guild members from being able to compete.
“Fair-goers may lose out if new fairs can’t take place or if existing fairs are under less competitive pressure to provide different or new attractions.”
The CMA said guild members made up 90% of the travelling fairs sector in the UK, a market estimated to be worth £100m a year. The regulator claims that the body’s rules and practices prevent competition in organising or attending fairs, and may also stop members from starting new fairs in competition with existing events.
Fairs tend to be staged at the request of local authorities, who ask an organiser to arrange to supply the attractions. The organisers tend to be guild members, who then widely use guild members to provide the rides.
The CMA alleges that even in cases where local authorities try to alter or improve a fair without the consent of the guild, “its members can boycott the whole fair as a result of the rules as happened in Newcastle in 2013 which meant the Hoppings Fair did not go ahead, leading to around half a million fair-goers who usually attend missing out”.
The Showmen’s Guild of Great Britain declined to comment on the CMA’s statement or explain what it does to look after its members’ interests.
However, the body’s website says it protects “the interests of its members ... by its code of rules for members and through the legal and constitutional processes of the land.
“Through its parliamentary agent, the guild contests any proposed legislation that discriminates against its members; or seeks concessions when legislation threatens their ability to make a living. In matters involving local authorities a delegation of officers will usually be called upon to represent member’s interests.”
The CMA added: “These are provisional findings only and no conclusion can be drawn at this stage that there has been a breach of competition law. We will carefully consider any representations before deciding whether the law has been broken.”
The 1998 Competition Act prohibits “agreements, practices and conduct that may have a damaging effect on competition” in the UK and covers “anti-competitive agreements, decisions by associations and concerted practices between businesses which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the UK and which may affect trade within the UK”.
Any business found to have infringed that section of the legislation can be fined up to 10% of its annual worldwide group turnover, the CMA said.

You thought sleep was the last refuge. You thought sleep was the one thing that couldn’t be packaged or pressed or juiced or diced or Instagrammed and made nice. You thought sleep was safe.
Where were you when Arianna Huffington invented sleep? How many courses into a dinner party does Huffington get without telling the story of how she woke up in a pool of blood after falling asleep at her desk and hitting her cheekbone? Do her friends text the 💤 emoji under the table? Probably.
Huffington has set up Thrive Global, to help people to go from “surviving to thriving” and, in part, to train them to get better sleep. Except, this isn’t just sleeping better: the movement is known as clean sleeping. #cleansleeping. #sleptclean.
Meanwhile, the Mail this week published an article by Gwyneth Paltrow from her new Goop Clean Beauty book on the “biggest health trend of 2017” – sleep. Paltrow writes: “Sleep plays such a powerful role in determining your appetite and energy levels, and I believe it should be your first priority.”
Let me first say that I like and agree with Paltrow, and Huffington, too. Sleep is incredibly important and, as someone who suffers from chronic insomnia, I know this only too well. I am glad that the importance of shuteye is being recognised. But why does it have to be a trend? It is quite something that being practically unconscious can be monetised. Just as the Brits and Americans turned hygge into A Thing, rather than us all just agreeing that, yes, mulled wine in front of a fire in your socks is quite nice.
But the dominant narrative of sleep has undoubtedly changed. It used to be that people boasted about how much they could achieve on how little sleep. Colleagues spoke of how few hours’ sleep they had – the adult version of talking about how little revision you did before a test. The presentation you did on three hours’ sleep is in the same family of “What? This old thing?” when complimented on a £300 Marant sweater. Or the “I’m so bad at drawing!” before turning the easel to reveal a Picasso.
Now it’s out with the Thatcher-like four power hours and droning on about how CEOs and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs such as Jack Dorsey rise at 5am after a couple of hours because you can sleep when you’re dead. The new boast is all about turning in at 10pm.
If there’s one thing more boring than someone talking about their dreams, it’s someone talking about their sleep. (And, of this, I am guilty.) I have always struggled with sleep. I have tried and tested countless sleep gadgets in my work as a tech journalist. I have trialled glasses that attempted to reset my circadian rhythm by shining blue light into my eyes. I have drowned my pillows in lavender spray and endured the brassy aftertaste of zopiclone. I have grabbed daytime slumber in my boss’s office, at Prague airport, on the floor of a Russian army barracks and the 214 bus. Sometimes I woke up in such bizarre positions or places it was amazing that someone hadn’t drawn chalk around me.
For a few weeks at the beginning of 2016, I slept. Hours. Regularly. “THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE HUMAN” is something I genuinely wanted to shout each morning. I think I had more sleep in that month or so than in the whole past decade. People spoke to me and, for once, their words weren’t bits of bread entering the soupy exhaustion of my brain that I would somehow have to digest and respond to. Sleep made me sharp. Sleep was wiping a misty window. An ice cube on the neck. I could take out three defenders and lob the keeper before breakfast, no problem. But soon I was back to 1am snatches of Twitter, late nights and stress.
It may be that sleep is a luxury that only the wealthy can afford. People not working, say, three jobs. Or not having to get up at ridiculous times for long commutes into cities they cannot afford to live in. Or not lying awake at night stressing about bills and rent. But Huffington and Paltrow are right – we can all make changes.
I would just say that the eye mask you buy doesn’t have to cost £20, nor do you have to rest among seven pillows on the bed of a luxury hotel to get some rest. So, here are a few basic, non-lux, sleep tips:
And that’s it. The perfect night’s sleep, all without an Instagram filter in sight. Well, one can dream.
 House visits are now the most common form of mummering. A group of mummers will call on friends and neighbours, where they get up to hijinks, play music, dance and act the fool. It is then the hosts’ job to guess the identity of each masked mummer. Once they have been correctly identified, they can remove their masks.

Welcome to our monthly roundup of the best new board games. This month, we’ll be fighting desperate battles in the Star Wars universe, confronting deadly diseases in 19th-century Spain, battling for first place in a prestigious cycling race and leading warring clans in medieval Scotland.
Star Wars fans have been treated to a Jabba-the-Hutt-sized selection of board games over the years, from the tense and tactical dogfights of the X-Wing Miniatures Game to the frankly inexplicable Star Wars Monopoly. Now there’s a new offering from a galaxy far, far away: Star Wars Destiny, which hands players control of bands of characters from the original films before throwing them into a deadly battle of wits using cards and dice.
Before the game begins, each player assembles their squad of characters as well as a deck of cards representing the allies, equipment and tactical ploys that will guide them towards victory. Different cards interact with one another in different ways, and the ongoing process of building, testing and refining your deck is a big part of the game’s appeal.
This will be familiar to anyone who has played similarly geeky card games like Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone or Android Netrunner, but what sets Destiny apart is the pace at which battles play out. Where other card games can feel like an exercise in grand strategy, it feels more like one of the heart-pounding action sequences from the Star Wars movies. The split turn structure, with players alternating taking one action at a time, gives the feeling of a furious back-and-forth struggle, and a handful of dice determine how well your characters perform at any given moment, forcing both players to react to a rapid-fire succession of unpredictable events.
While the goodies-vs-baddies starter sets give you enough cards and dice to try the game out, you’ll need to buy add-on packs if you want to build your own personalised decks. But it means that you can expect regular releases of new cards adding more characters and tactical options, and for Star Wars fans this is an adrenaline-fuelled and faithful take on the lasers-and-lightsabers epic.
Released in 2008, the best-selling cooperative game Pandemic casts players as a team of medics working to eradicate diseases from cities around the globe. It’s a slick, tense and challenging experience, and over the years it has spawned a series of spinoffs.
Pandemic Iberia is the latest addition to the lineup, set in 1848 with the nascent forces of medical science locked in a battle with cholera, malaria, yellow fever and typhus across Spain and Portugal. It’s visually gorgeous, with stunning artwork, a board that looks like an old vellum map and some striking Moorish-inspired graphics, and at its heart it plays similarly to the original Pandemic. 
There are some big changes, though. Rather than jetting around the world, you’ll have to travel by ship and build railway connections between cities to make your way across the map. And while the limitations of 19th-century medicine mean you don’t have the power to eradicate diseases outright, you’ll attempt to slow their spread by purifying water supplies in different areas of the board.
There’s also a new cast of characters, each with their own special abilities, and alternate game modes that see panicked citizens flooding towards hospitals, or individual diseases behaving in different ways, forcing you to adapt your tactics to defeat them.
It’s a powerful combination, and it’s hard to find anything about Pandemic Iberia to criticise, although at almost £50 it’s quite an investment. If you’re not already a fan of the Pandemic series then the original game is a better place to start. But for seasoned players, this is a brilliant new spin on a modern classic.
Full disclosure: This game’s co-designer Matt Leacock once paid for the use of some of my photography.
Recently republished with updated artwork, 1999 card game Schotten Totten sees rival Scottish clans compete to snatch land from one another by moving the boundary stones between their two villages. The game begins with nine stones up for grabs, and players take turns laying cards against them to establish a superior claim and seize them for their side.
Each card comes with a number and a colour, and certain combinations are more powerful than others. As the game plays out, you’ll attempt to build stronger three-card sets than your opponent against each stone, and the whole process feels a bit like playing nine simultaneous rounds of poker.
It is less complicated than it sounds, but the game’s real challenge comes from the fact that you and your opponent will both be drawing new cards from a shared deck. There’s no way of knowing what you’re going to draw, or what your opponent might already have in their hand, and it means that while Schotten Totten is an engaging, constantly evolving puzzle, it’s also about bluffing and misdirection.
It’s a tight, elegant, quick fix of head-to-head brainy competition that squeezes a lot of thoughtful gameplay out of a simple set of rules. At £12, there’s really no excuse not to own it.
Named after the red flag used to mark the final kilometre of a cycling race, Flamme Rouge puts players in control of a team of riders in a competition that’s similar to but legally distinct from the Tour de France. The game comes with a stack of interlocking road sections that can be assembled to form different tracks, and you’ll control cyclists represented by toy-like plastic miniatures. It scores serious points for presentation, but it also attempts to capture the essence of a real-world road race.
You’ll take charge of two cyclists: a rouleur, who moves at a steady pace, and a sprinteur, who specialises in aggressive bursts of speed. Each rider comes with a corresponding deck of cards, and on every round you’ll draw four at random from each deck, choosing one to play and returning the rest to the bottom of the pile to be re-drawn later in the game. Cards move your riders a varying number of spaces along the track, but you won’t always want to play the fastest cards available. Use a slower card on a downhill section of the track and you’ll gain a speed boost. Play a fast card on an uphill stretch and you’ll suffer a penalty to your movement.
Then there’s exhaustion. If your rider finds themselves at the head of the pack, they’ll be forced to add low-speed cards to their deck representing physical strain. It means that for much of the race you’ll want to actively avoid taking the lead, hugging your opponent’s rear wheel and letting them tire themselves out before the decisive dash to the finish line.
It’s a nice concept, but after a few rounds it starts to feel a little flat. You’re repeating the same process again and again, and while perfecting your tactics and timing is a challenge, it feels like the game would benefit from a little more variety. Given the choice, I’d rather play the excellent motor racing game Automobiles, which uses some similar ideas but injects quite a bit more depth.
Living with the loss of a loved one is always hard, but grief can feel more acute at certain times of the year. At Christmas, for instance, when people come together, the absence of friends or family can be more keenly felt. So what are the best ways to cope? 
We asked for our readers’ experiences. Here are their stories.
Last year, my family and I spent Christmas Day in a hospital in Oxford, plating up a dinner for my mum and dad. We had paper hats and crackers. It was my mum’s first meal in four weeks. It was important to us, as we had spent the previous three months by her bedside waiting for a diagnosis. We learned that she had had central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, but they said the odds were good. That year we got the greatest gift ever: hope. 
Fast forward to today, and it’s been seven weeks since I lost my beloved mother. The thought of Christmas this year has made me somewhat uneasy, though I know I must get through it for the sake of my children. I have been coping as best I can, getting on with everyday life. But while trying to untangle my Christmas tree lights recently the full weight of my loss came crashing down. I was overcome with emotion and it took me a few days to come back from a seemingly bottomless pit. 
Christmas has amplified my grief. I’ve been made dizzy by the twinkling lights, festive songs and endless present-buying. The pressure to be happy has knocked me off my feet. Usually I can keep up with all the festive cheer, but this year I am not fit for the marathon.
The only advice I have been given is, “be kind to yourself”, “surround yourself with loved ones” and “let it out”. This is what people tell me on a daily basis. So with this in mind, I am heading up north to my in-laws. There is no doubt their Christmas jumper camaraderie will soften my woes. But I know that every moment I feel the slightest joy, I will see my mum’s face – and wonder if she, too, is sitting somewhere in a Christmas jumper missing me.
My husband, Brian, passed away five years ago after suffering for seven years with multiple myeloma (a rare blood cancer). He was a gentle, witty, loving man.
Brian worked as a credit union manager and enjoyed his job. His passion from childhood, however, was flying: he got his pilot’s licence at Biggin Hill when he was 20, and flew small planes and gliders for years.
He had friends from all walks of life. We first met at Brian’s father’s wedding when his (widowed) father married my aunt. Brian was seven and I was five; we began dating 10 years later. Brian moved to London – but we kept in touch and met again and married in our 20s. We have one daughter.
We miss Brian every day, but Christmas is especially hard. Our families are connected because of his dad and my aunt. Brian was the centre of any party and always had his guitar close at hand. He was very musical. There is a huge hole in our lives now – and although people say time is a healer, in some ways I find it gets harder. As the years go by he seems further away.
Every year we meet Brian’s extended family for brunch on Christmas Eve – it’s a big family gathering. We talk about him and how much we all miss him. It brings him closer, even if it’s just for a few hours. It might sound flippant but I think it’s important to talk about the person you lost. Where possible stay in touch with mutual friends and share memories.
It’s easy to become isolated and cocooned at this time of year. Make a huge effort to meet people – and don’t be afraid to talk about your sadness and loss.
I lost my 12-year-old son Brandon six years ago in a car accident. It’s never easy remembering the night he died, or even talking about it, but doing so has become part of my healing process.
For the first couple of years it was very hard for me. I surrounded myself with family members, especially my two sons who survived the accident. You go through a stage of shock, where you try to come to terms with the fact that person is not coming back. I also went through a stage of fearing night-time, because that’s when the accident happened. I would stay up all night until I saw daylight.
I learned to cope by celebrating my son’s life; for instance, we mark his birthday every January. Christmas is the hardest time of year because it was the very last holiday we got to spend together as a family. I lost him in the summer. He was a happy boy who loved his family so much; I can still see his smiling face.
I celebrate his legacy by giving back to the community. He loved to help others and had a big heart. Once a year, on the anniversary of his death, I give away book bags and school supplies at his favourite book store to help families in our community in Dutchess County. And I try to offer love and compassion to other parents who have lost a child. I’ve become particularly close to another woman who lost a son. We support each other.
We also honour Brandon by wearing a T-shirt with his picture on it. My advice for anyone dealing with grief is allow God to be your strength. Celebrate your loved one and remember that grieving doesn’t have a time frame.
My wife died unexpectedly on 12 November. She had not been ill. She had an epileptic fit during the night, which led to pulmonary aspiration. She stopped breathing and died.
This will be the first Christmas my daughter and I will spend without her. People don’t know whether they should send cards; in some cases, they can’t bring themselves to say “Happy Christmas”. I know they are just trying to be kind, but they are being over-sensitive.
My wife loved Christmas, and loved shopping for our extended family. I now have to juggle coping without her and trying to provide some kind of normality for my daughter.
People who do not know Helen has died, naturally, still send cards addressed to all three of us. I find seeing all of our names on the envelope and card painful. The sense of loss will be most acute around Christmas Day. I used to stay up the night before with her until the early hours wrapping presents. 
The best way to cope with grief is to talk about the person you have lost. Do not bottle up emotion. Be prepared for periods of normality, and then – out of the blue – intense emotion. Be fully aware that you will never truly get over your loss, there is no magic day of closure. Accept all and any support offered.
In time you will adjust. Ultimately, life goes on – and the person you have lost would want you to carry on.
I lost my big sister suddenly in October 2014. She had just had a coffee with our parents before getting into her car to drive home. She had a cardiac arrest before she even turned on the engine. About two months later we got a diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). The same genetic heart condition that caused the footballer, Fabrice Muamba, to collapse.
Christmas is one of the hardest times of year, along with the anniversary of her death and her birthday. To have someone missing during the festive period is painful. We can all be sitting around together and I will find myself waiting for the doorbell to ring and for her to come in. For a long time her death didn’t feel real. That is a very common reaction when you lose somebody suddenly and unexpectedly.
Every year at Christmas I raise a glass to her while watching the Strictly Come Dancing special. We would never agree on our favourites. I know that she would’ve hated Ed Balls, but I loved him. I can hear her commenting on the smugness of certain contestants. That may sound silly, but thinking about this helps. She loved the show.
It’s OK to be sad; pretending otherwise is pointless. It helps to speak about the one you lost, even if it is painful. It’s also good to try to find beauty in music, church, family, charity – wherever you can.
It will always be sad and tragic, but the more you bring the person you lost into Christmas, the easier it gets over time. 
Sales of Grandma’s favourite Christmas tipple, sherry, have slumped in the past decade.
Sherry and port have been losing out to more fashionable drinks such as sparkling wine and gin, both of which have seen booming sales this year.
Sales of sherry fell to 10m bottles last year in the UK, less than half the 22m sold in 2005, and the pace of decline has stepped up in the past year, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA).
Sales of fortified wine, which also includes port, vermouth and madeira, fell by 5% in the year to 5 November, to 315 hectolitres, and the pace of decline rose to 7% in the last three months of that period.
Sales of fortified wine in restaurants and bars was also down in the three months to October, by 4% year on year, a turnaround from growth seen earlier in the year.
Fine sherries, such as the drier fino and manzanilla styles popular in Spain, have seen strong growth in recent years, boosted by a trend for sherry bars and tapas. Sainsbury’s said its sales of premium sherries were up 14% year on year. But sales of traditional cream sherries, which far outsell the other types – particularly at Christmas – have ebbed.
A spokesman for market researcher Wine Intelligence said sherry sales were down as “the generation raised on cream sherry is growing smaller and fortified wines are relegated to bottom shelves hidden from view”. Its research shows that just 10% of 25- to 34-year-olds drink sherry compared with 34% of over-65s.
The WSTA blames falling sales on increasing taxation. It says that since 2007, fortified wine duty has increased by 53%, adding £1 to a bottle of port or sherry. The industry is likely to come under further pressure from the fall in the value of the pound, which makes importing wine from Europe more expensive.
Miles Beale, chief executive of the WSTA, called on the government to cut back taxes on fortified wine: “Whether it’s the sherry shared as an aperitif or left out for Santa, a port to accompany the cheese course at the end of Christmas lunch or vermouth shaken or stirred in a classic martini – these drinks have been enjoyed by the British for centuries. It would be incredibly sad to see the British traditions associated with these drinks, which have been passed down through the generations, disappear.”
It is six months since we woke up on 24 June to be greeted by the referendum result to leave the EU, an outcome that exposed a divided Britain. At the time, the anger on both the leave and remain sides was palpable, and when I was asked to talk to people who had been thrown into bitter conflict with their own families over the results, the fury I encountered was potent. Most apparent was the sense of betrayal felt by remainers – particularly younger adults – towards members of their own families who voted leave and therefore, as some saw it, discarded their futures.
Conventional wisdom states that time is a healer, but I disagree: it’s more of a modifier. At the time, several interviewees were so hurt that they were unsure how their family relationships could be healed. But since, with little achieved politically and much of the rightwing press spewing more than enough divisive bile to go around, many of them seem to have settled into a very English diplomatic avoidance of the topic.
“We just try not to talk about it because it still feels quite sore,” says Jo, whose parents and parents-in-law voted for Brexit. She’s still angry, she says, but there is a weariness in her voice that implies that sustaining the kind of rage she felt in the immediate aftermath of the result was impossible.
But she has become more careful about what she posts on social media: “There was a meme I reposted along the lines of: ‘When your parents said, “I will give you something to cry about,” we didn’t know they meant Brexit,’ and my mother-in-law got fairly stroppy in a comment on my page,” she says.
“I think the mother-in-law and father-in-law relationship is always quite difficult … if I bring up Brexit, my husband’s parents get quite angry. They voted Ukip in the election, so we knew they had quite negative views,” she says. “This is going to sound awful, but they read the Daily Express, so I expected it of them. They are quite rightwing. But my parents have never been.”
Jo was much more upset about her parents’ vote. They are Liberal Democrat voters from the north-east, were always strongly anti-Thatcherite, and were some of the many “lexit” voters. “They thought it [the EU] ended up being something beyond what they voted for,” she says.
“I no longer talk to my dad about it; he just shuts down. My mum gets quite upset if I mention it. I think she’s upset that I’m upset.”
Emma, from the West Country, had a similar experience in June, saying at the time: “My mum [who voted Brexit] now feels bad about how upset I am … we are having very tense conversations.” Six months on, she has also decided it’s easier to avoid the topic.
“I’ve been through the full grief cycle, and landed, finally, on acceptance. I’m now interested primarily in making the best of a bad situation. I tend not to speak about it with my parents, especially with my mum, as we would just argue again. My dad is frustrated by how long it is taking to get a plan and trigger article 50, and we argue about how much time should be spent on plans versus giving stability to the market – I favour the former, he the latter.”
While Jo says the daily headlines about the political machinations regarding Brexit act as a reminder of the rift, stoking up people’s anger once again, Emma feels they have helped to foster peace and compromise. “The anger and sadness has gone, and I think we have been brought together overall by sharing a feeling of uncertainty. And what’s more, we’ve found common ground on one thing – a dislike of Trump!”
She is not the only one to be negotiating calmer seas. In late June, Stephanie from Merseyside had just had an awful week of arguments at her parents’ house. “I have never felt so insulted by members of my own family before,” she said then, adding that their belittling of her decision to vote remain had “made her see them in a different light”. This month, when I caught up with her, relations had mellowed. “Things have calmed down,” she says. “In the immediate aftermath emotions were running high and, as my family and I are all very passionate people, fallings-out were inevitable.
“At this point, while we are all still divided over the pros and cons of leaving, we agree on certain things: the need for a plan to go through parliament, and how even if the government was convinced of a remain win, it should have had a plan in case of a leave vote.”
Even the families where both sides remain defiant seem to have realised that arguing is pointless. “He exists in an irrational universe,” says one interviewee, who had been considering uninviting her Brexit-voting uncle and his wife from her wedding. “I can be angry at his narrow-mindedness and cause a rift, or I can simply invite him while privately considering him to be a complete tit, as most of the family does. I’m not even angry with him, really. He has just lost my respect.
“When someone is immune to facts, where is the sense in arguing with them? That person isn’t going to change their mind.”
Likewise, Jo doesn’t avoid the topic with her parents just because it causes grief, but because there doesn’t seem to be anything productive in having yet another discussion about it. They are, she says, old and set in their ways.
“They think we’re children and don’t really understand. It’s a case of ‘we know best’, basically. How can you argue against that? They don’t feel conned at all. It’s this post-truth thing. We seem to have a backlash against facts … I don’t wish to sound patronising, but people in their 20s and 30s have been brought up in an information age; they do know that a lot of it is rubbish.”
Much has been made of the generational gulf that the referendum exposed, but it also highlighted differences between those who have left the communities they grew up in and have an outward-looking attitude to the world, and those who are still there. Another interviewee, from west Wales, was dismayed at the result and its economic implications for Wales, though she no longer lives there. Despite having a daughter who spent her entire adult life working or studying on EU-funded programmes, her mother hadn’t bothered to vote. She was angry about this, and still struggles when her mother expresses anti-immigrant sentiment, but has made an effort in the months since to understand.
“My mother repeated the rhetoric of ‘immigrants taking all the jobs’ in a recent phone call, which I pretty much ignored, as my mum’s not a lady to argue with,” she says. “The economics of the area are tough, but whether or not unemployment is exacerbated by immigrants there presently, I couldn’t say. Our town was ‘priority one’ for EU regional development funding – it’s highly unlikely that the funding will ever be replaced by Westminster. In around 2007, it became home to a large group of Polish civil engineers and builders. In a town of 6,000 people, it was an easily noticeable change. I think it did cause problems, in that it was around the time of the credit crunch and jobs were scarce.”
She plans to find work abroad, Brexit allowing. “After the vote, I felt ashamed both to be British and Welsh, something I have never experienced, and it was devastating. Jo Cox’s horrific murder, anti-immigrant/refugee sentiment in the news and the racist incidents after the vote really made me worry what the UK could become,” she says. “I’m pursuing the science/environmental career route [and] it seems to be tougher now, as research will definitely lose funding … so if I do find an opportunity outside the UK, I would not hesitate to take it.”
I catch up with another former interviewee who also dreamed of living abroad. “My parents have voted away my right to live and work in nearly 30 countries,” she said in June. Now, she says she is still angry, but she and her father are in uneasy truce territory.
But she feels some good has come of it. “I’m trying to convert my dismay at the result into productive action rather than feeling helpless and angry. I’m volunteering at a language centre that gives free English classes to non-native speakers. I want to help anyone who felt marginalised by the result of the vote by letting them know they are welcome here,” she says.
“I’m also taking a course to refresh my German and am considering options for working abroad next year … I just want to make the most of my chances before I find them curtailed.”
Not everyone sees Brexit as a disaster. Emily, 26, who voted leave, much to the dismay of her family, said in June that she wasn’t sure she had made the right decision, but now sees Brexit as an opportunity. “I don’t Bregrexit any more. I wish I’d held my conviction after the vote,” she says, when we catch up.
“I’m moving to a new flat that is £200 a month cheaper post-Brexit … we now have a state-educated woman prime minister who wants to raise the minimum wage further and has talked about having workers on company boards.
“I still have to lie to colleagues and friends about which way I voted. My parents are more forgiving. With the world becoming increasingly unstable, my dad, a remain voter, thinks there could be more black-swan moments similar to Trump across Europe next year. If the far right starts to take back control of the EU, he’d rather be out than in.”
The recent rise of populist far-right movements isn’t something that has brought all families together. In June, Alex said: “I can barely look at my parents.” And now? “I think my mum is starting to regret her decision to vote leave, as she’s been forced to watch a similar situation unfold over in the US with Trump’s win. Now, she seems to be listening more to my concerns rather than just shooting them down. Likewise, I am also much more accepting of her views and have relaxed a bit, as I know that she’s still a great person.”
“My dad is a different story, though. He lives in Essex and really seems to be embracing this whole rightwing populist thing – not in a really aggressive way, but he buys the Daily Mail and believes every single thing they publish. I saw him very occasionally before the referendum, but part of me just wants to avoid him completely now.”
As for Sarah, who at the time was accused of “calling her family racist” after things turned quite nasty in the days following the result, Brexit has acted as a catalyst. “My family have always been racist, sexist and homophobic, and the referendum result has just shined a massive spotlight on their behaviour. [It gave them] a green light to be overtly racist rather than keeping it behind closed doors.”
And so, she has made the difficult decision to let go of some family members. “I am afraid, like many, I’m guilty of little more than eye-rolling when someone makes a racial slur and it has really made me realise I can’t do that. I have to challenge it,” she says. “It feels wrong to say it, but I feel relief mostly. There is no sadness there and I’ve certainly not removed people just because they voted leave … The referendum just gave me the kick up the backside to deal with something I should have years ago.”

The battle for pop culture’s top spot was so convoluted and fiercely fought this year, and with so many intertwining cross-textual sub-plots, that it made Games of Thrones look like a game of KerPlunk.
In June, we witnessed the celebrity world’s Red Wedding. This involved a series of connected spats involving Taylor Swift and Kanye West (the former objecting to her inclusion in the latter’s song, Famous), Kim Kardashian (who provided the smoking gun: footage of Swift giving her inclusion the thumbs up) and a supporting cast featuring Swift’s former boyfriend Calvin Harris and Katy Perry, who chipped in with some helpful bon mots of her own. Somewhere in all this was Tom Hiddleston, whose relationship with Swift seemed so contrived that many fans assumed it was part of a staged, conceptual art piece on the nature of modern fame.
This battle took place on social media between practitioners of old-fashioned fame, such as Swift, and the modern type of fame, such as Kardashian, posing questions about the myriad ways it is possible to become famous at a time when traditional household names can carry less digital relevance – and less earning power – than Instagram-famous teens.
By the end of the year, West had been hospitalised and the Kardashians were keeping a low profile after Kim was mugged in Paris. Perry loudly endorsed Hillary Clinton while Swift’s silence on the matter was seen as tacit endorsement of Trump. Hiddleswift ended, and Calvin Harris released a song about working in M&S. The rest of us, meanwhile, were left to ponder the shifting rules of life in the public eye.
It was once the case that celebrities relied on press, TV and radio to spread their message, but Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat now mean famous people have a direct line of communication with fans. “For stars constantly in the press, social media has made image maintenance easier for the PR and manager,” explains a senior publicist with vast experience of high-level celebrities. Let’s call him Publicist M. “We’re able to present the narrative we want to tell – we can do that instantly and adapt it when needed.”
In a world where celebrities control their own narratives, But some celebrities are simply better digital storytellers than others. “It’s important to be transparent in your words,” suggests Andy Beal, an online reputation consultant. “That doesn’t mean you can’t be selective with what you share – the danger is when you manipulate or embellish the truth.”
It may well be easier than ever to tell your own story, but it’s also easier than ever for others to give their own side of the argument. “Disaster strikes when the star is rattling around in a multi-million dollar pad with too many rooms and too much time,” Publicist M says. “They spend hours scrolling down their phone, getting worked up and going off-message with foolish posts. That’s when I get the call and have to drop everything to fix a problem that wasn’t there to begin with. We’ve used excuses ranging from ‘it was a joke’ to ‘the phone was hacked’.” Sometimes, he adds, it’s necessary to suck it up and suffer 24 hours’ embarrassment.
“That rule was always there, and in the old days it was easy,” says Dean Piper, the former Sunday Mirror showbiz columnist. “These days you can’t really get away with doing anything in public, which sometimes makes me wonder if people want those things to come out.”
It was Piper’s frustration with “social fucking media” that prompted a recent move into PR. “Showbiz journalism in 2016,” he points out, “is just writing up what has happened on social media, 12 hours after it happened.”
Perhaps this hints at another way celebrities can control the media narrative: if reporters are kept busy embedding tweets in 20 news posts a day, they’re not out and about looking for other stories.
It is a theory backed up by Publicist M: “Whenever A-listers get together it’s always assumed it’s a set up,” he says. “But the reality is it’s easier for stars to date within their own circle. If anything, many hookups never get reported at all – they take place behind closed doors in a complicated maze of hotel service elevators and exiting through restaurant kitchens. Most stars simply don’t want their personal lives splashed over the press.”
In bygone times (which is to say before about 2006), famous people would justifiably complain when the media didn’t tell the truth, but now that they develop their own narratives, they realise how useful it can be to blur the lines between fact and fiction.
For some stars, the question isn’t how true or false something might be – it’s how much attention it might get online. Fans can be complicit, approaching the world of celebrity in the same way one might engage with WWE: you suspect that some of what you’re seeing is faked, but you reach for the popcorn anyway. Was it any wonder we thought Swift and Hiddleston’s relationship was either fake or a conceptual art piece designed to trap the media?
“Authenticity, like spontaneity, can be carefully choreographed,” says Benjamin Cook, who created the Becoming YouTube documentary series in 2012. He tells the story of finding himself at a big YouTube event in Florida and, afterwards, sitting in a car with three big-name YouTubers. “They’d just taken a selfie in the back seat and one of them was about to post it. They were debating – for five whole minutes, with no hint of irony – how to word the tweet to make it more ‘relatable’. It had to be relatable.”
Fast-forward to summer 2016, and Cook was watching Adele at Glastonbury. “She kept reminding us how the night before she had been on the sofa with a Chinese takeaway, then she did the washing-up and took the bins out. I was thinking: you’re Adele! You don’t have to try so hard to seem relatable. I don’t need to know that you do your own laundry in order to love you.”
Organisations such as press-governing body Ipso are there to ensure that mistakes, genuine or deliberate, are corrected with an apology. Right? “Even when I have evidence proving a story to be incorrect, an apology never happens,” says Publicist M. “It’s always the same conversation: without making it explicit, it is implied the publication will go to war on my client and run a series of stories that will destroy them.”
How about super-injunctions, though? If you know a story’s about to come out, can you squash it? “Super-injunctions are a lengthy, expensive waste of time in which lawyers make enough money to buy a house in the Cotswolds, and that’s about it,” Publicist M says. “I always advise against them and instead suggest we start a dialogue to remove some sections of the story. It works with tabloids as long as it involves a major star, as the tabloid knows they’ll need the star in future to sell papers.”
Beyond modern celebrity’s tentpole characters there’s a huge selection of names who spring from shows such as Geordie Shore, Ex on the Beach, Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity Dinner Date. One man who has done them all is Durham-born Ricci Guarnaccio. “I’ve done so many reality TV shows, but it’s not about the fame,” is his surprisingly noble take on things. Then he adds: “It’s about the money.”
“Our main source of income is a lump sum when you do the show, or personal appearances,” he continues. “But you’re always looking for the next thing because if you’ve been off TV for a long period of time, it’s harder to get work.” Asked for clarification, he says “a long period of time” is about six months.
If you want Guarnaccio at your nightclub for a couple of hours, you can expect to pay him between £1,000 and £2,500, then there are paid social posts for “things like fake tans”, which also keep money coming in. “I didn’t even have Facebook when I went on Geordie Shore, now there are so many networks to keep on top of to stay relevant,” he says. “Two days ago, I had a conference call with my manager to discuss which pictures to put up, when, and which frames to use. You’ve got to tweet at peak times.”
It’s not exactly a hand-to-mouth existence but, whereas Kanye West will never not be famous, people such as Guarnaccio and his Geordie Shore pals know they’re perilously close to the celebrity/civilian borderline. Guarnaccio accepts that if it does all go wrong, he can at least fall back on his former profession as a fully trained hairdresser. “I’ve seen a few good friends who’ve come across badly on TV, it hasn’t worked out, they’re skint and they’re still chasing fame,” he warns.
“They don’t want to bite the bullet and go back to normal jobs, because they still see themselves as a celebrity.”
A decade ago, Katie Price defined this brand of fiercely competitive career celebrity with a string of autobiographies, novels, horse garments, TV shows and clothes. “Even she’s having to really think about where her career’s going,” notes Piper. “And if people like Katie Price can’t carry on the drama, you’re running out of ideas.”
Piper’s advice is blunt. “The days are numbered for celebrities bringing in thousands of pounds by being fundamentally untalented,” he warns. “If you’re that sort of celebrity, you’re basically fucked. Get a proper job and use your brain.”
But there’s no shortage of cash being hurled at aspirational teens and influencers on YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat. These are characters thriving under the radar, and beyond the reach of traditional celebrity outlets.
Cook suggests that it is missing the point to ask why the likes of Zoella haven’t crossed over into presenting roles on shows such as, for instance, Xtra Factor. “They just don’t want to. Seriously, why would you? Zoella doesn’t need TV. Her videos get 20m, 25m views per month – and she makes them herself, at home. Most YouTubers who are even half as successful as Zoella will have more creative freedom – and be earning more money – on YouTube.”
“I’m, like, this close to overexposure,” was one of the more self-aware statements Swift made in her leaked conversation with West. Our Geordie Shore friend Guarnaccio may well be right that his peers have a six-month window to top up their fame or risk being forgotten but, for the world’s biggest stars, it is OK to disappear for a year. After all: how can you stage a comeback if you’ve never gone away?
Publicist M agrees, outlining a six-point career resuscitation timeline for Swift: “She should retire the ridiculous squad, take the paps off the pay roll, fire the team and disappear to her Rhode Island mansion for a year to grow up and realise she is not, and has never been, a victim. Then she should come back with a killer album that makes no reference to this past year.” Sensible advice.

Newly arrived in England after eight years in the south-west of Ireland, we dumped our stuff in Kennington, south London, and went to my then husband’s parents’ house for Christmas. It was the late 80s, and our marriage was heading for the rocks.
There’d been some idea that a complete change would do us good, though quite how the flat in Kennington was supposed to energise us I have no idea. It was bleak and damp, three flights up on an estate with stinky stairwells and rubbish overflowing in the yards. Still, it was a change from cabin fever. I was looking forward to furnishing it with my books, which had been stored in a large wardrobe at my parents-in-law’s all the time we’d been away.
I never wanted to leave them there, but was persuaded. The argument ran: we are going to live in a cowshed, a tent and a derelict cottage for the foreseeable future. It will be damp. You don’t want your books getting ruined by damp. Let’s store them with my folks and bring them over later. So we did. And over the years a few found their way over, in dribs and drabs. But every time I insisted on getting the lot, there was some reason or other why I couldn’t.
Oh, they’re fine. My folks don’t mind – they’ve got loads of room.
There’s not enough space in the car.
His mum said she thought they were in the shed. I found a cardboard box among the gardening tools and odds and ends, the kind a printer might come in. Unless it had Tardis-like qualities, my books could not be there. But there they were, a dreggy miscellany not even filling the box.
He was in the kitchen. “My books are gone,” I said. And he came to look.
I don’t remember the conversation in the shed. I remember the picture in my head of my books as they once were, covering a whole wall; and the increasing panic – mine that they were gone, his that I might upset his parents.
He loved his mum and dad. He’d put them through some worries in his time and was now very protective of their feelings.
“It’s OK,” he said, “they probably just forgot where they put them. We’ll get Christmas over then I’ll sort it out.” Could I ruin this family Christmas? Everyone stuffed to bursting, his sister, her boyfriend, her two copper-haired toddlers bouncing about the room to the delight of their besotted grandparents; the tree, the decorations, the old film on the telly, the blazing fire, the discarded wrapping paper. His parents had bought me some furry gloves. When I asked about my books, everything was vague. They’d been moving stuff around. The loft maybe? Where are the ladders?
Not now, not now.
I found out two days later that they’d given my books to a Boys’ Brigade jumble sale. I saw my books thrown in boxes, spread out on a table, in piles on the floor, people poking through them, buying my ancient Come Hither for 50p, my dad’s Lovecrafts for 10p each. I lost the books of my childhood and my lifetime.
The books of my dead father with his signature and the date in faded ink on the flyleaves. His old art books, the big hessian-backed 101 Details From The National Gallery; I copied the pictures out of it learning to draw. I lost the lovely big Dover paperbacks; the Ancient Mariner illustrated by Gustave Doré; my Louis Untermeyer poetry book with the pictures coloured in; a tiny handwritten Song of the Morrow; Ulysses with a bow on the spine; Great Fairy Tales, a galleon embossed on the cover; and my old Bob Dylan catalogue from the “Judas” concert, 1966, at Manchester’s Free Trade Hall. I lost the Moomins and Borrowers and Narnias and Patricia Lynchs (which you couldn’t get hold of any more), all the old Ruperts, and Orlando the Marmalade Cat.
Tip of the iceberg. They were only books. He talked about temporality and the virtue of valuing people more than things. They were nice people, his mum and dad, good people. Anything they’d done had been innocently done. They must not be disturbed. They just had no idea that books could matter. No blame, as it says in my old I Ching, the one that vanished with all the rest.
What hurt was his anger at my “over-reaction”, how paltry he considered the loss. Only books. But everything I lost at that time – Ireland, my marriage, old friends, my mother – was summed up in those books.
It took a while to see my part. The books were mine – I should have taken control, but I had let them drift. Things had to change. It was the end of drifting and the beginning of a different life.
A bit of sparkle … a jazzy top … here are some sartorial plans for 25 December
On her way to hospice my patient had one last thing to take care of. She has had a difficult time for the past several years culminating in such an aggressive and visually distressing recurrence that even she says she had had enough and just wants to die. She remains at home for as long as she can, receiving visitors and cherishing her grandchildren, until it’s just too hard. Then, graciously and calmly, she submits to hospice, and along with it, the truth that these are the very final days of her life.
Sometimes, she reminds me of the feted neurologist, Oliver Sacks, and the grace with which he faced the end of his life – except she would laugh at the comparison, calling herself an ordinary woman who had worked hard, reared two wonderful children, and just as she felt she had acquitted her roles, lost the lottery to cancer.
The last time we met, she was breathless, uncomfortable and fatigued. But her face shone with a rare dignity. She told me that while she wasn’t afraid to die, she grieved for her son who was disabled and depended on her for care. I understood immediately that her greatest worry was his welfare upon her impending death. Her daughter sat next to her, outwardly calm, but her expression reflecting private horror at the prospect of losing her mother and becoming the sole guardian of her brother, while fulfilling the usual responsibilities of work and motherhood. Even in a clinic where sadness reigns, their story moved me greatly and I wanted desperately to help.
“I feel as if there’s nothing I can do for you personally but I’m going to see about your son,” I said, unable to keep the defeat from my voice. I promised nothing and she expected nothing but by luck, a phone call explaining the urgency and pathos of the situation helped decisions that would have happened anyway. But it meant that in the final days of her life, a mother knew that her child would be safe.
“Fragile”, declares the sign on the box resting on the floor as I enter my office. Curiosity takes second place as I gently move it out of the way so it’s not a tripping hazard. The intervening hours are taken up by ill patients and it’s not until a receptionist reminds me that I think to open it.
Behind layers of beautiful wrapping there lies an exquisite edible tree. Luscious strawberries hang on branches, coated in delectable chocolate. A star-shaped piece of pineapple sits atop the tree. I stand still, catching my breath at the work of art. A small card nestles at the base of the tree. I detach it, careful not to disturb the branches of the tree. The card reads simply, “Thank you for looking after our son and brother.” My throat catches. Having underestimated her panic, I had clearly also underestimated her subsequent relief.
I call her at the hospice. The nurse, initially sceptical, puts me through. She speaks slowly, breathlessly but that she is thrilled at my pleasure is apparent. I don’t know how to say that I am particularly moved to be in her thoughts at the end of her life, when typically, the oncologist is thought to have failed, but she fills in the silence with a firm instruction: “Listen, take this gift home. I want your children to know what you do and just how much you are appreciated.”
Upon hearing this, I am suffused by a type of survivor’s guilt. All this for doing my job? For moving a small piece of a giant puzzle? I can’t even say I will see her next week or next month. Instead, I reassure her that she is in good hands. And I drive home slowly, taking care to not topple my gift.
The philosopher Seneca remarked, “What need is there to weep over parts of life? The whole of it calls for tears.” A career in medicine can feel like that, amid the pressures and politics. Each day is a scramble – the healthiest patients protest; the sickest suffer quietly; the neediest don’t even recognise their need.
The funding is never sufficient and the bureaucracy is never efficient. Just like in other aspects of modern life, it has become customary to be at the mercy of the cynical message that says medicine has become entirely transactional, that doctors don’t care for patients like they used to and patients don’t respect doctors like they used to. But just as this cynicism threatens to vanquish you, you realise that the beauty and wonder of the doctor-patient relationship is actually alive and well, manifest in the most unexpected encounters.
It’s fairly common to hear stories of doctors who go beyond the call of duty to help their patients but if I have learnt anything from being a doctor, it’s the way in which patients impel doctors to realise the better angels of our nature.
If I were to name one attribute that trumps fear in a cancer clinic, it’s generosity. Just as you thought there couldn’t possibly be room in a patient’s heart for anything other than the most urgent of needs, there arrives a card in the mail, the photo of a longed-for baby, a letter of appreciation, or sometimes an edible tree that says thank you for looking after me, thank you for accompanying me on my journey of terror, thank you for being you.
Mostly you’re floored, knowing full well that much of a patient’s outcome, excellent or awful, depends on biology, environment and a whole lot of factors beyond the control of your prescribing finger, but you can’t help admiring the character of people who, even when they are dying, spare a thought for someone else. It’s not that these acknowledgements make us feel more important than that they remind us of universal experiences and shared humanity. They speak to us of empathy, compassion, and humility, not as the exclusive domain of the doctor but indeed, flowing in equal measure towards the doctor.
My edible tree comes home and is greeted with gasps of wonder and squeals of delight that must surely be audible to my patient. Read the card at least, I say, but my children are too busy. The strawberries are picked and the chocolate licked. The pineapple star is evenly divided. For a long while there is only the sound of contentment until someone finally says, “It must be hard work to earn these chocolates, well done!”
I think to myself that somewhere in her sleep my patient must be smiling, knowing that her wish had been fulfilled.
The first 10 minutes of being stuck in the tunnel are fine – I mean they’re not great, but there’s air conditioning and there are lights and there’s the sense that whatever the problem is, it will be fixed soon and we’ll be on our way.
We’re all on our phones, saying we’ll be a little late.
In my carriage are north shore types, mostly middle aged in suits and summer shift dresses, briefcases, shopping bags with Christmas presents across the seats, heading home in the heat.
I am rushing to a meeting – I need to be there for my friend to have a quorum. She is starting an NGO and its constitution stipulates five people need to attend a meeting.
The worst is that it’s Wynyard tunnel. Eugh, Wynyard, the ugliest station in Sydney. No charm, weird layout, a bad vibe attached to it, a smell like salami left in the sun.
Even its name – Wynyard – is crap.
Of course I would be stuck at Wynyard.
At the start we are given updates every few minutes.
“We’re going slowly because of power supply issues.”
“We’ve stopped because a train in front of us has broken down at Wynyard.”
“We expect delays of no more than 10 minutes.”
And on it goes.
The voice sounds Anglo-Pakistani and young. We collectively identify him as on our side and as clueless as we are – he’s our hapless saviour. Later he makes a weak joke, and we laugh even when there is not much air.
About half an hour in, there is another voice. It’s mostly indecipherable, and prefaced with a loud unpleasant noise like a fax machine dialling numbers then an older voice (who is this – someone higher up in CityRail? Speaking from a control tower? Someone who has access to air?) He’s using words like “pentanenhubble” and “grid appterns”. What is this – rail talk? Then the lights flicker off in a way that can only be described as sinister and the air is cut and we know we’re in for a longer haul.
A woman behind me is having a panic attack – but it’s a quiet one. Its like she thinks she’s going to die but doesn’t want to much bother anyone about it.
She’s as sweaty and waxy-complexioned as the rest of us, but her eyes are wide and frozen and her fingers are on her wrists as if she is taking her own pulse.
In the seats around her are two men and a woman – older – who have something in their countenance of figures from a Rembrandt painting, specifically The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp.
They are leaning in but not too close and they are talking to her in a particular way – bland, soothing, constant: “Take a breathe and you’ll adjust. It’s OK, just a little stuffy. There’s plenty of air, you will be able to breathe – all right?”
After an hour the air has become very thin and stale. It’s the gruel of air. People were joking and talking and laughing before but the carriage is quiet – no jokes now, nor people making calls. It’s as if we want to save the air, and to talk is to waste it. There is, however, the strange strobe-lighting effect of flash photography. As we are told to move towards the front of the train, most people in the carriage are taking photos of the crush of passengers and weird, grim selfies – their shirt wet with sweat against the backdrop of the CityRail electric blue upholstery.
An earlier announcement had told us to get ready to walk along the tracks – they actually used the term “detrain” (or though perhaps “derail” would be a better expression). Most of us are crammed at the front of the carriage, ready to walk. But the latest round of messages is that they are going to do a “reset” of the train – like it is a broken laptop and they just need to turn the power off and on.
I tweet about being stuck in the train. Channels Nine and Seven want me to shoot video footage.
I get contacted from someone who wants me to be on breakfast radio. But the most exciting thing is connecting with a stranger – also on Twitter – who is in the carriage ahead of me.
“Do you have any water?” I ask him.
He doesn’t but tells me: “Couple of babies in my carriage; one man fanning a stranger’s baby to keep it cool and another offering his apple!”
And: “Passengers in my carriage using intercom to request guard open doors for air. Request denied for fear passengers will leave train.”
Then right on cue – an announcement: “Do not force the doors open and walk on to the tracks.”
OMG – who would do that?
Maybe someone who thinks they are going to die. Maybe someone who is having a panic attack. Maybe someone who feels as if the carriage is running out of air.
There is contagion in panic. I feel a surge of it myself.
There is announcement to the effect of “could all babies come to the front of the train”.
I imagine all the babies jumping out of their hot prams, bidding their parents farewell and walking to the front of the train: “So long suckers, we’re out of here.”
People with bikes are to leave them on the train.
People in wheelchairs are to stay on the train.
Yet still no movement. I fantasise about breaking a window. I don’t want escape, yet I long for a cool breeze, some movement in the air.
Passengers around me are discussing whether or not to break out and walk along the tracks. A man behind me is telling a fellow passenger, “I don’t have anyone waiting for me at home, not even a pet.”
After 90 minutes the Anglo-Pakistani voice surfaces again. When he says, “Finally – I think we might be on our way”, we clap him.
Then we are told we can leave the carriage and walk along the tracks.
My trio of Nicolaes Tulps are still low-talking to the panicked passenger, but she is up, standing and ready to roll.
We exit down a ladder and a ramp and on to the pitch-black tracks with lights here and there. I look out for rats and feel obscurely disappointed when I see none.
The man in front of me touches one of the lights as we pass, as if to gauge what it’s made of. Maybe he’s always wanted to walk the tunnels. We walk up a ramp, on to another train, the one that’s stuck – and walk through that then on to a platform where someone gives us bottles of warm water. And then we “tap off” – that will be $3.38 thanks – and ascend from Wynyard up to George Street. I gulp the air. 
After such an ordeal I get home to a note a neighbour has left me under the door.
“I personally in my 30+ years in this unit, never hung my private wears in the public line … it is very unpleasant to have the private undies of other people’s where I can’t avoid it.”
Only a week ago I had written a column about breakfast host Sam Armytage being underpants shamed, and now I was being shamed for my undies hanging on the clothes line.
Is this a thing? Is it really considered bad form to hang your underwear on a communal clothesline? It’s just material, drying in the sun.
Popular brands of crumpets contain “alarmingly high” amounts of salt, with one “giant” version having an amount equivalent to that of more than three bags of ready salted crisps, a survey has found.
Warburtons’ Giant Crumpets contain twice the concentration of salt per 100g than a Waitrose own-brand version, showing that the content can easily be reduced by manufacturers, Consensus Action on Salt and Health (Cash) said.
Almost half (48%) of the 27 crumpets included in the survey exceeded the government’s responsibility deal 2017 average salt targets for crumpets of 1.13g of salt per 100g, while seven products exceeded the maximum salt target of 1.25g salt per 100g.
The target for crumpets is the same as for sausages, meaning many brands are saltier than sausages by concentration, Cash said.
The average salt level per crumpet was 0.62g, which is nearly the same amount as found in one and a half packets of ready salted crisps.
Its survey found the Warburtons range of crumpets were the worst offenders, with the giant range containing 1.48g of salt per 100g, or 1.55g per crumpet – more than a quarter of the recommended daily maximum of salt for adults, without any topping.
Overall, salt levels in branded crumpets were significantly higher on average than supermarket own-label versions, with gluten-free alternatives being saltier than normal crumpets.
Waitrose Deep and Delicious Buttermilk crumpets and Essential Waitrose crumpets contained half the amount of salt per 100g as the Warburtons crumpets.
Cash’s nutritionist and campaign director, Katharine Jenner, said: “Salt reduction has been recognised as a public health priority for a number of years, so responsible manufacturers know they should be reducing salt in their foods.
“It’s shocking that certain brands of crumpets still contain more salt than three bags of ready salted crisps. It’s imperative that retailers, food manufacturers and the out-of-home catering sector work much harder to help us achieve the public health goal of consuming no more than 6g salt per person per day.”
Cash’s chairman, Graham MacGregor, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London, said: “Reducing salt is the most cost-effective measure to lower blood pressure and reduce the number of people suffering from strokes and heart disease, one of the commonest causes of death in the UK.
“Salt reduction targets have been set for manufacturers to reach before the end of 2017, and if some companies, for example Warburtons, don’t achieve them, we must regulate the targets to ensure a level playing field, as requested by many of the supermarkets and British Retail Consortium.”
Warburtons said it had invested significantly in technology and innovation to reduce salt levels by 25% in recent years. A spokeswoman said: “We continue to look for opportunities to further reduce the overall levels of salt across our range by using baking powder alternatives, such as potassium bicarbonate, which has yet to be approved by government.
“Consumers can find all nutritional information on pack and we are signed up to the government’s voluntary traffic light labelling scheme, for which all of our crumpets are rated amber.” 
Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: “The amount of salt we consume is slowly going down, but we are still eating too much, leaving many of us at risk of high blood pressure and the chance of having a heart attack or stroke. 
“Tackling the amount of salt people consume cannot be left to the individual alone. The food industry has made good progress, with reductions of up to 50% in some everyday foods. More still needs to be done and we encourage all sectors – including the eating out of home sector – to continue working towards achieving the 2017 salt targets.”
Crumpets with the highest amount of salt per 100g, according to the Cash findings, include:
A short stroll on Christmas Day is the antidote for many a gluttonous festive feast. But according to health experts, a post-dinner walk would have to last four and a half hours to work off the calories of a typical Christmas dinner with all the trimmings.
Figures released by the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) on Wednesday reveal that the average person will consume about 6,000 calories on Christmas Day alone, nearly three times the recommended daily intake for women and more than twice the recommended amount for men.
According to researchers, one mince pie would take 37 minutes of frenetic ice-skating to work off the calories, while a large glass of mulled wine would take about 44 minutes to walk off.
As those tasked with cooking Christmas dinner buy their ingredients this week, research shows that where you buy each component could also significantly affect your calorie intake.
The Guardian looked at eight big supermarkets and compared the fat, sugar and calorie content of key ingredients in a typical Christmas dinner, using the supermarket’s own luxury brand.
While turkey is a lean white meat – notoriously easy to dry out if left a little long in the oven – there was more than four times as much fat in a Marks & Spencer’s bird than one from Lidl, which also had the fewest calories.
The most calorific cranberry sauce from the supermarkets surveyed was Aldi’s Scandi-inspired lingonberry and cranberry sauce, 60% of which was sugars, compared with only 18.5% of M&S’s cranberry sauce.
Aldi shoppers are the least likely to feel out of pocket when they get to the checkout, after it was found to have the cheapest festive meal in the annual Good Housekeeping magazine festive shopping basket cost survey. It found that all the ingredients for Christmas dinner for eight cost just £22.03. Lidl came in at second place (£24.57), while Iceland came third. The most expensive basket was from Marks & Spencer (£49.40) followed by Waitrose (£40.02).
But those looking to get as much fat for their money as possible might want to get stuck into those cosy pigs in blankets. If bought from Tesco they will contain 325 calories per 100g, or 58 calories per little pig. The lowest calorie version could be found in M&S, where there was still nearly 22g of fat per 100g of the things.
We consume plenty of vegetables on Christmas Day, even if younger – and sometimes older – family members will employ ingenious tricks to hide overcooked sprouts. However, ready-to-roast frozen potatoes and parsnips tend to contain more calories than fresh items.
Aldi’s frozen roast potatoes (cooked, of course, in goose fat) contain 201 calories per 100g, with 9.3g of fat, while the healthiest are from Sainsbury’s, at 117 calories per 100g. Aldi’s Four Seasons parsnips with a honey glaze are also the most calorie-laden of the bunch, with 253 calories per 100g, while there are only 118 calories in Morrison’s own-brand version.
Among Christmas puddings, Aldi’s version has the most calories, at 347 per 100g, while Tesco’s version has the most sugar (44g) and Marks & Spencer’s the most fat.
Lidl’s own-brand Snowy Lodge mince pies sold out in many parts of the UK last year after coming second in a Which? taste test, but each little pie contains 257 calories, including 9.4g of fat.
According to RSPH, when we put all of that together we are likely to consume 1,450 calories during Christmas dinner, and then another 820 if we have space for Christmas pudding with cream. That’s about seven hours of walking, if you wanted to work off the lot in one day, according to Shirley Cramer, chief executive of the RSPH. “Trying not to over-indulge too much and keeping active over the holidays might help a little when it comes to avoiding a nasty shock on the scales and a lot of hard work in the new year,” she said.
Dr Frankie Phillips, dietitian and British Dietetic Association spokesperson, said there was another way. “Christmas dinner has a bad reputation, but it can actually be a very healthy meal,” she said. “It could be the one time of year where people actually pile up a lot of vegetables of their plate.”
Brussels sprouts contain folate, potassium, fibre and vitamin C, parsnips provide fibre and folate, while cabbage also has folate as well as calcium, iron, fibre and vitamin C.
To make Christmas dinner just that touch healthier, Phillips recommends not overcooking the vegetables, and using the cooking water to help make gravy so that no nutrients are lost. And, quite simply, not eating until you are fit to burst.
“Stopping eating when you feel satisfied is the way to go; no one feels great if they have overeaten,” she said. “And just try and bear in mind how much you are eating – and drinking during the day. If you are going to have a mince pie, try to just have one.”

From books and beauty products to beer and bird food, these gifts keep on giving long after Father Christmas has returned home
Indigenous chef Mark Olive, aka The Black Olive, makes Christmas lunch with Australia’s native ingredients such as wattle seeds and warrigal greens, and eggnog using an emu egg. ‘Indigenous herbs are an exciting thing, we should be using more of them,’ he says in this special Guardian film. ‘Australia has an opportunity to invent its own cuisine. We have this amazing cuisine here that we don’t use. We’ve embraced every other culture in this country except what we’ve got in our own backyard … get out there, explore these flavours, smell them and try them’
Cream 150g caster sugar and the egg yolk, slowly adding the sugar while whisking. Heat the milk over a water bath, adding creamed egg and sugar slowly as it thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Chill for an hour in the fridge or sit over an ice bath to cool down. Add the vanilla essence. Beat the cream until it peaks, and set aside. Whisk the egg whites slowly, incorporating the remaining sugar until it peaks. Add the brandy. Fold in the egg whites and the whipped cream.
Served chilled or warm in a tall glass with grated nutmeg.
100g of warrigal greens or silverbeet
1 loaf light rye bread
1g native thyme or thyme
2g native pepper or black pepper
2g salt bush or pink salt
3 sticks celery, diced
2 medium brown onions, diced
6 leaves of fresh sage, chopped
50g butter
10 whole eggs
2g sea parsley or parsley
Blanch off warrigal greens, rinse under cold water and squeeze out excess moisture. Set aside to dry while you prepare the rest of the mixture. De-crust the bread and cut into small diced pieces and place in a bowl. Add the remaining dry ingredients as well as the chopped warrigal greens and mix through the bread. (The greens may also be chopped and sprinkled on top at the end to give the stuffing a vibrant lift in colour.) Fry off the celery and onions and sage in the butter and stir until soft. Stir through bread mixture. Whisk the eggs and then combine through the stuffing mixture until moist. Add milk if it feels too dry – it should just come together and not be slushy.
Turn out into a baking tray and cook in preheated oven at 160C until firm and browned. Check after 20 minutes. Turn out and cut into appropriate slices.
Now that a reality TV star is preparing to become president of the United States, can we agree that celebrity culture is more than just harmless fun – that it might, in fact, be an essential component of the systems that govern our lives?
The rise of celebrity culture did not happen by itself. It has long been cultivated by advertisers, marketers and the media. And it has a function. The more distant and impersonal corporations become, the more they rely on other people’s faces to connect them to their customers.
Corporation means body; capital means head. But corporate capital has neither head nor body. It is hard for people to attach themselves to a homogenised franchise owned by a hedge fund whose corporate identity consists of a filing cabinet in Panama City. So the machine needs a mask. It must wear the face of someone we see as often as we see our next-door neighbours. It is pointless to ask what Kim Kardashian does to earn her living: her role is to exist in our minds. By playing our virtual neighbour, she induces a click of recognition on behalf of whatever grey monolith sits behind her this week.
An obsession with celebrity does not lie quietly beside the other things we value; it takes their place. A study published in the journal Cyberpsychology reveals that an extraordinary shift appears to have taken place between 1997 and 2007 in the US. In 1997, the dominant values (as judged by an adult audience) expressed by the shows most popular among nine- to 11 year-olds were community feeling, followed by benevolence. Fame came 15th out of the 16 values tested. By 2007, when shows such as Hannah Montana prevailed, fame came first, followed by achievement, image, popularity and financial success. Community feeling had fallen to 11th, benevolence to 12th.
A paper in the International Journal of Cultural Studies found that, among the people it surveyed in the UK, those who follow celebrity gossip most closely are three times less likely than people interested in other forms of news to be involved in local organisations, and half as likely to volunteer. Virtual neighbours replace real ones.
The blander and more homogenised the product, the more distinctive the mask it needs to wear. This is why Iggy Pop was used to promote motor insurance and Benicio del Toro is used to sell Heineken. The role of such people is to suggest that there is something more exciting behind the logo than office blocks and spreadsheets. They transfer their edginess to the company they represent. As soon they take the cheque that buys their identity, they become as processed and meaningless as the item they are promoting.
The celebrities you see most often are the most lucrative products, extruded through a willing media by a marketing industry whose power no one seeks to check. This is why actors and models now receive such disproportionate attention, capturing much of the space once occupied by people with their own ideas: their expertise lies in channelling other people’s visions.
A database search by the anthropologist Grant McCracken reveals that in the US actors received 17% of the cultural attention accorded to famous people between 1900 and 1910: slightly less than physicists, chemists and biologists combined. Film directors received 6% and writers 11%. Between 1900 and 1950, actors had 24% of the coverage, and writers 9%. By 2010, actors accounted for 37% (over four times the attention natural scientists received), while the proportion allocated to both film directors and writers fell to 3%.
You don’t have to read or watch many interviews to see that the principal qualities now sought in a celebrity are vapidity, vacuity and physical beauty. They can be used as a blank screen on to which anything can be projected. With a few exceptions, those who have least to say are granted the greatest number of platforms on which to say it.
This helps to explain the mass delusion among young people that they have a reasonable chance of becoming famous. A survey of 16-year-olds in the UK revealed that 54% of them intend to become celebrities.
As soon as celebrities forget their allotted role, the hounds of hell are let loose upon them. Lily Allen was the media’s darling when she was advertising John Lewis. Gary Lineker couldn’t put a foot wrong when he stuck to selling junk food to children. But when they expressed sympathy for refugees, they were torn to shreds. When you take the corporate shilling, you are supposed to stop thinking for yourself.
Celebrity has a second major role: as a weapon of mass distraction. The survey published in the IJCS I mentioned earlier also reveals that people who are the most interested in celebrity are the least engaged in politics, the least likely to protest and the least likely to vote. This appears to shatter the media’s frequent, self-justifying claim that celebrities connect us to public life.
The survey found that people fixated by celebrity watch the news on average as much as others do, but they appear to exist in a state of permanent diversion. If you want people to remain quiescent and unengaged, show them the faces of Taylor Swift, Shia LaBeouf and Cara Delevingne several times a day.
In Trump we see a perfect fusion of the two main uses of celebrity culture: corporate personification and mass distraction. His celebrity became a mask for his own chaotic, outsourced and unscrupulous business empire. His public image was the perfect inversion of everything he and his companies represent. As presenter of the US version of The Apprentice, this spoilt heir to humongous wealth became the face of enterprise and social mobility. During the presidential elections, his noisy persona distracted people from the intellectual void behind the mask, a void now filled by more lucid representatives of global capital.
Celebrities might inhabit your life, but they are not your friends. Regardless of the intentions of those on whom it is bequeathed, celebrity is the lieutenant of exploitation. Let’s turn our neighbours back into our neighbours, and turn our backs on those who impersonate them.

Outdoor air pollution has grown by 8% around the world in the last five years, according to new data by the World Health Organization. Some of the world’s biggest cities have significantly high pollution levels.
Take New York, for example. A recent NYU study looked at the health of 300,000 residents and concluded that individuals living in zipcodes with higher concentrations of pollution – as measured by the Environmental Protection Agency – had a 24% higher chance of having artery constriction.
Now, a New York City-based designer thinks he might have the solution. To the awareness problem, at least. Nikolas Gregory Bentel recently released a new line of long-sleeved shirts called Aerochromics, which change colors according to pollution levels in the air. The shirts are priced starting at $500.
“Aerochromics is a statement on the rapid deterioration of the our world’s air quality,” Bentel says. “Air quality is only one small part of the larger spectrum of the pollution that we are slowly seeing taking hold of our planet.”
The shirts are available in three black-and-white designs, and took Bentel one year to develop. The shirts track different pollutants – carbon monoxide, particulate pollution and radiation – and work similarly to a household carbon monoxide detector. Chemical salts turn carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide, and that oxidation process transforms the color of the shirts. If carbon monoxide levels fall and oxygen levels increase, the colors change again.
While countless smartphone apps can tell you pollution levels, Bentel argues that rather than turning to phones, tablets and computers that have to be carried around, apparel can do more than just be a fashion statement. “The shirt forces the user to be aware of pollution levels constantly,” he says. “I wanted to apply this tech to an object that was already being used without hesitation every day and was visible from any direction.”
To test particle pollution – one of the biggest concerns for cities with low air quality – Bentel’s shirts use two sensors placed in the front and the back. A micro-controller in the shirts’ collar activates heat pads, changing the shirts’ colors from black to spotted. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, anything above 51 on the Air Quality Index (AQI) is a “moderate” health concern. Aerochromics shirts go into effect at 60, slowly shifting to the black-and-white pattern. But as the AQI escalates, reaching 160, or “unhealthy”, the shirts’ complete pattern becomes apparent.
A different version of the Aerochromics shirt changes permanently when exposed to radiation. Exposure of gamma or electron beam radiation causes dyes in the shirt to change color. Once the shirt is exposed to significant amounts of radiation, it remains in that color and pattern.
Funded personally through income from his design studio in Queens, Aerochromics is not Bentel’s first venture. He also created Ripley, a ring that gets its oxidized finish by going through a person’s digestive system; Data Arbitrage, a program that floods the market with fake social media accounts to dilute data resale values; and Higher Tides, a fake real estate company that claims to help buyers find real estate that would retain value post the impact of climate change.
Considering this background in art meets activism, it’s unclear who, exactly, these shirts are targeting. Bentel says he has a “stream of customers”, but refused to provide any more information, or access to them. However, he promises the cost of the shirts will fall in the future, making them more reasonably priced. “This was my first product run for the shirts so I wanted to be sure there was a demand before bringing down the cost,” he says.
Bentel also says a number of academic institutions and commercial companies have also reached out to him about the shirts, but withheld names. “I am not too interested in selling a lot of the clothing,” Bentel says. “The online shop is secondary to the concept. I see Aerochromics first as a statement.”
So is it business or is it art? “This seems like a novel type of clothing line that might, because of the novelty, become fashionable,” says Mark Jacobson, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University.
Aerochromics isn’t the first project to blend environmental concerns with technology and fashion. In 2011, two New York City students designed sweatshirts that changed color when met with high levels of carbon monoxide. More recently, Kasia Molga, a British artist and designer who suffers from asthma, premiered a new line of wearable technology that responds to air quality. The project, titled Human Sensor, made its debut in Manchester, England’s industrial hub, as models paraded around the city in the futuristic designs, illustrating how pollution levels change.
But, for all the efforts to raise awareness, Aerochromics doesn’t actually offer any practical solutions. The shirts are made with conventional cotton, not organic cotton, which has been criticized by environmentalists for harsh use of pesticides and insecticides, a type of chemical pollutants.
Whether Bentel’s shirts will change the dialogue on urban pollution remains to be seen. “It makes people more aware of the pollution around them,” Jacobson concedes.
In particular, he points to the air pollution and carbon monoxide shirts. If these change color when exposed to cigarette smoke, which contains both ingredients, it could be a deterrent to smoking as well. “It might make smokers more cognizant of the pollution they are inflicting on non-smokers,” Jacobson says.
Prostate has long been the Cinderella of cancers, lagging behind others – in particular breast cancer – when it comes to diagnosis, treatment and the funding that goes into research.
But scientists at University College London have made what they believe is a real breakthrough using a drug derived from bacteria found at the bottom of the sea, injected into the bloodstream and activated in the prostate by laser beams. There is also massive excitement from patients, who have been calling UCL ever since the news got out.
The really good news is that this treatment has been shown to kill cancerous cells in the prostate without the serious and sometimes life-changing consequences of surgery. A radical operation to remove the whole prostate gland risks leaving patients incontinent or impotent. That’s why for so many years the standard of care has been to operate only on men who are at high risk of the disease progressing and becoming a killer. The rest are assigned to active surveillance. That means regular testing to ensure the cancer is not spreading – but no treatment. Even symptom-free, many men find that psychologically hard to live with.
Among those under surveillance are men at very low risk, who are very likely to die with their cancer and not of it. But for others at higher risk of the cancer spreading, the new therapy could be really helpful.
The study by Mark Emberton and colleagues, published in the Lancet Oncology journal, tells us a lot about the promise of this therapy, but does not answer all the questions about its future. It could not, Emberton told the Guardian, because the authors had to find a design for the trial that would satisfy the European medicines regulator but without the advantage of technologies that have advanced massively in just the last few years.
“The prostate cancer landscape has been changing so quickly that no trial could keep up with the pace of change,” he said. When they started, just five years ago, MRI scans were not universally available and they had to guess where in the prostate the cancer was. Biopsies are hit or miss.
The researchers focused on 400 men at low risk and treated half with the therapy, placing optical fibres into the prostate to carry the laser beam. The drug is made from bacteria that live on the ocean floor and are adept at converting any light into high intensity energy, which then kills cancer cells when activated in the prostate without harming normal tissue. The other group were given active surveillance as normal.
At the end of two years, the cancer had progressed in 28% of treated patients compared with 58% of those on active surveillance. It was not a clean sweep, but, says Emberton, if they were to do the study now, with the help of MRI scans, they could hit the cancerous parts of the prostate rather than going in blind and the results would be much better. There were side-effects, but mostly they had cleared up by the end of the two years.
What nobody can know is whether the cancer will stay away – the treated patients will be monitored for years to find out.
Emberton and the charity Prostate Cancer UK think the therapy will be most useful in patients in the grey zone – between low and high risk – although for the purposes of the study they had to do it with those at low risk. It is not for everyone. Those at very low risk are still better off with no treatment and no side-effects.
The idea of a drug made of harmless bacteria that can be activated by light to become cancer killers is not a new one. Photodynamic therapy is already being used to treat skin cancer and others where light can easily penetrate. Unfortunately, it has also been abused. Quack clinics offer unproven PDT for brain and other cancers that lasers cannot reach, taking huge amounts of money from families trying everything to save the life of a child.
But this new technology, says Emberton, has been very carefully developed and he believes it could have application in other forms of cancer. He hopes it will get a licence and be approved for use in the NHS – as early as possible, because for now, all they can tell their many callers is that the trial is over and the treatment is no longer available.

Christmas isn’t all it’s wrapped up to be
You’ll not find it mentioned in carols or pictured on cards, but phalaenopsis orchids fly off the shelves in supermarkets, big box DIY shops and chic florists alike in December. This obsession is not new, nor is it limited to Christmas: we have been coveting orchids since the first plant hunters were sent across the globe in the eighteenth century to track down specimens at great expense, and often at the cost of their lives.
To trace this orchidelirium back through history, I recommend reading The Orchid Thief by Susan Orlean. It is not a pretty story, in places. Orlean writes: “Because orchid hunters hated the thought of another hunter’s finding any plants they might have missed, they would ‘collect out’ an area, and then they would burn the place down.” Unfortunately an illegal trade in orchids ripped from the wild continues today, although the vast majority of commercially-available moth orchids are hybrids mass produced via tissue culture techniques developed in the 1970s. You can watch a video of a UK orchid greenhouse in production here. Referring back to my previous post on mistletoe, it’s worth noting that moth orchids are not parasites or even hemiparasites, but epiphytes - they use trees as an anchor point, but gain no sustenance from them.
Phalaenopsis make great gifts, and for about the same price as a hand-tied bouquet, they should last far longer, provided if you follow some simple rules. If you find it hard to keep moth orchids alive, or simply want to try something different, try a cape primrose, aka streptocarpus. They are available from many garden centres, and Dibleys Nursery in Wales provide a mail order gift service for these easygoing houseplants.
This is the bit where I try to find something positive to say about poinsettias as a houseplant, and fail. I must be in a minority in my unalloyed hatred of this plant*, as they are still hugely popular. I write “as a houseplant”, because look at pictures of growing in their native Mexico and other parts of the world where the climate is right, and they are rather charming shrubs (or in some cases, trees).
But indoors, my problem with them is twofold: they are hard to keep alive in the average house, and then people will insist on treating them as permanent residents. You can try to keep your poinsettia until next Christmas so it can rebloom, but you will have to look at an ugly plant all year and you’ll still fail, most likely. In his still unsurpassed book The Houseplant Expert, Dr DG Hessayon explains an important distinction between flowering pot plants and houseplants: about the former he writes: “Don’t choose a flowering pot plant if you want something which will permanently adorn your living room.”
Nevertheless, like many iconic plants, poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima) has an interesting backstory if you care to look: the Aztecs called it cuetlaxochitl (brilliant flower), made a purple dye from its bracts and a fever medicine from its sap. Joel Roberts Poinsett, US ambassador to Mexico, brought it home from his travels in 1825. Just as for moth orchids, plant breeders in the 1960s worked hard to make the poinsettia more colourful, compact and floriferous, making it the blockbuster Christmas plant it is today.
If you have bought one of these and want to keep it alive at least until the new year, it requires humidity - achieved by grouping plants together and/or standing the pot on a tray filled with pebbles and water - careful watering (let the compost dry out between applications) and bright light but not direct sunlight. If you still want rush out and buy a poinsettia, at least consider plant miles - look for the Home Grown logo which indicates the plant was grown in the UK.
*No, the white ones aren’t any better.
Given the current craze for cacti, I’d hoped for a revival in the fate of the Schlumbergera, a plant you probably last saw in a basket pot on your grandmother’s console table circa 1979. The Christmas cactus (close relatives Schlumbergera truncata and S. × buckleyi are both referred to by this common name) is, like the moth orchid, aother epiphyte, hanging around in the shade of the tropical rainforests of Brazil, being pollinated by hummingbirds.
I can’t find who first described their flowers as resembling leaping shrimps, but they were absolutely right. The blooms come in all possible shades of pink, white and purple, although new orange and yellow cultivars are being developed by breeders.
For a wonderfully geeky post about Schlumbergera breeding and all things Christmas cactus-related, visit the houseplant blog Plants Are The Strangest People. For a shorter read, there’s care advice in this piece by Alys Fowler.
If you are looking for knockout scent to fill your house this Christmas, this is the flowering bulb you need. Tazetta daffodil types - usually the paperwhite narcissus N. ‘Ziva’ - is specially prepared to flower in time for December 25. It’s too late to plant now, but seek out pre-planted arrangements. There’s a secret to stopping them from growing too leggy and flopping over, and it involves vodka. Seriously.
One word of warning: not everyone loves the perfume of paperwhites. As Fragrant Earth (a self-described “olfactory blog”) explains, one component of the paperwhites’ unmistakeable scent is indole, and some people’s noses find this adds a fetid edge that’s really rather unpleasant. So you may want to sniff before you try.
Before we go any further, let’s just get the nomenclature issue out of the way. The popular name is amaryllis, but despite an ongoing debate, hippeastrum is generally accepted as being correct.
Naming is the most boring aspect of a truly mindboggling plant. There is something monstrous and wonderful about the hippeastrum. I don’t think anyone has put it better than Monty Don, who once wrote in the Observer: “The flower stem develops as a phallic joke before opening out into a huge funnel like the horn on a wind-up gramophone.” Sounds like fun, doesn’t it?
Hippeastrum, like any popular houseplant, have been bred into a variety of degrees of gaudiness; although as Alys Fowler points out in this column from last year, there are members of the clan that are more subtle - stylish even. Personally, I’d buy the brashiest, brightest hippeastrum you can find: they just make me chuckle with glee. I know this contradicts my previous statements about brash poinsettias, but plant love never was logical.
You may be keeping watch on a hippeastrum bud right now, wondering if it will break open in time for Christmas. Or may receive a “bulb kit” as a gift. If you fancy investing in a plant to cheer up your spring, Laidback Gardener has an excellent blogpost on the drawbacks of those “everything you need” growing kits and how to choose a bare bulb.
Relegated to the bottom of the festive booze hierarchy, beer tends to gets a bad rap at Christmas. Unfairly so, because seasonal beers can be so much more than cans of lager that accumulate dust at parties while everyone guzzles eggnog. Belgian breweries have been turning out unabashedly sweet, spicy winter ales for centuries, and now everyone else, from craft breweries to supermarkets, has followed suit.
While anything that tastes like the boozy run-off from Christmas pudding is welcome at my dinner table, the best festive beers should also have a sense of occasion about them. Or at least the potential for pantomime drama, whether that comes from tapping a mini-keg without it detonating, or attempting to mull a bottle of cherry beer (from experience these are activities best attempted before, not after, drinking an 11% stout).
Here are some of the best traditional – and not so traditional – Christmas beers to enjoy this year.
With a name like plum pudding porter, this generous beer could have rolled straight out of a Dickens novel. It radiates ripe, stone fruit – plums and apricots – and Christmas spice. In the glass, it’s a thick, almost impenetrable, Christmas pudding brown, with sugary marzipan and spice on the nose. Juicy and fruity and dark, but with a porter’s roasted malty backbone of coffee and bitter chocolate.
The innovative Danish brewer’s modern take on a Belgian Christmas ale has all the booziness you’d expect of a strong Belgian beer, without being sickly sweet. Glowing golden amber in the glass, it smells like warmed fruit and berries, and tastes like caramel, with a hint of astringency that could come from the coriander seeds it’s brewed with. Because it is so full-bodied, the rich, candied orange peel taste lingers and lingers – this would be amazing paired with dark chocolate and dried fruit.
One to enjoy after Midnight Mass, this abbey-style beer (which effectively means it’s brewed by monks but doesn’t fulfil the strict criteria needed to be considered a Trappist beer) is a Christmas classic. Boasting a strong, brandy-like nose, with a slightly sour note, it tastes rich and sweet and has a musty, barrel-aged depth. Brewed with liquorice, there’s also a very subtle undercurrent of salt and aniseed.
Meantime’s broody dark ale promises all the fun of popping a champagne cork without the price tag and with a (potentially) milder hangover. Served in a wine bottle with a cork, it smells like dark chocolate and woodsmoke, but tastes like juicy berries. There is a whiff of port from the barrel-ageing process, but not enough to make it taste heavy or winey – it’s more like molten, fizzy, dark cherry chocolate.
A mischievous little beer that packs an extraordinary – 10% ABV kind of extraordinary – punch. It’s thick, dense and orange in look and taste; slightly floral on the nose, with some botanicals. It also has a juicy, mango mouthfeel (so, one for fans of strong IPA) and sticky toffee notes that give way to citrus bitterness at the end – think candied orange peel. This is a beer that ages really well, and the 2015 is delicious at the moment. Look out for the 2016 early next year and stash it in the cellar if you’ve got the self-control.
One for real ale enthusiasts. British hops lend this beer an earthy body that’s a welcome break from the sweet fruitiness of a lot of Christmas beer. There is a little spiciness and a touch of sweet candy and raisin, but nothing overpowering – and nothing you’d object to if you drank it by the pint, or used it to wash down roast potatoes.
Adnams ale is usually evocative of summers spent at its seaside brewery and warm afternoons eating fish and chips on the shore. But its Christmas ale – available, to my intense delight, in a DIY keg – is its wintry, fireside twin. Pouring a mahogany brown, this is a festive beer for drinkers who want to get as far away from nutmeg and dried cherry flavours as possible: it is toasty, caramel and toffee-ish, with all the depth of the brewery’s distinctive yeast. 
Fabulously bitter, this cranberry stout is a great refresher to enjoy at the end of a long night of sweet wine and port. It pours jet black with a thick head and smells like coffee, nuts, chocolates and vanilla. So far, so stout, which means that the taste – almost burned, like cocoa nibs and espresso – is a welcome surprise. This beer is not as creamy as you might expect and any sweetness comes from the tart cranberries it has been brewed with.
With its soft banana and herb notes, this offering from the famous St Bernardus brewery in Belgium is one for fans of wheat beers. It is punchy and strong at 10% ABV. Factor in the cloves and Christmas spices it is laced with and this will keep you positively toasty this winter.
Mulled beer sounds like the kind of bad idea you might have at the end of a raucous Christmas party. In fact, this warmable cherry beer is an absolute world-beater. Heat it gently, as you would wine and it gives off the most overwhelming rich cherry, spice and marzipan aroma. Like mulled wine it tastes best glugged from a mug – all sweet fruit and cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves, but with none of the spice detritus to deal with at the end. Don’t try to drink this cold, and it’s probably best not try mulling any other beers you have lying around. 
Every year, usually in October, we visit Maremma, a glorious cummerbund of a region straddling lower Tuscany and higher Lazio. We stay at the same hotel, an old-fashioned place that sits in folds of green, run impeccably and kindly by a woman called Graziella, who looks like a combination of Isabella Rossellini, Patricia Routledge and Robin Williams as Mrs Doubtfire. We do the same things: lie in sulphurous hot springs, have one monumental argument, walk, play cards. We eat the same things: aquacotta, white beans, peppery beef stew, bread, and drink red wine. Maremmani know how to cook white beans, simmering them until tender, often in terracotta, and occasionally in time-honoured fashion, al fiasco, in a glass flask in the embers of a fire. Fat, tender, creamy and often still warm, the beans are served with a little of their own broth and some extra virgin olive oil – you can’t talk about white beans in Tuscany without talking about extra virgin olive oil. If Rome taught me to love beans, Maremma made me a bean-eater.
There are plenty of strongly held opinions about cooking beans in Maremma … in Tuscany ... in Italy. Just like learning a language, you listen and repeat; then once you are confident, you do it your way. Then you may get stuck in your ways, digging in your kitchen heels. I am not sure why I had never thought to cook beans in the oven before – which is nearest to the embers, I suppose – but I hadn’t. I now know it is a good way, producing plump, deeply flavoured beans. Not that you can’t get beautifully flavoured beans on the stove top, but it must be something about the effect of baking as opposed to boiling heat, the taste of both beans and broth is richer and rounder somehow. Same with sage and garlic. In the oven, the sage loses its aggressive bitterness, taking on a savoury, almost meaty fragrance. Garlic, too, benefits from baking; it brings out its kinder side, the inside of the cloves becoming so sweet and soft they can be squeezed from the skin like cream from a tube. I add salt to the beans, along with the oil and herbs. (Seasoning at the start is different to seasoning at the end – I don’t believe it toughens the beans as some people say – but if you prefer, add salt at the end.)
Remembering to soak the beans – that’s the thing. One way is never to put them away, even if it is in a large, possibly attractive Kilner jar. Leave them in slightly irritating full view. A friend once suggested leaving beans beside the corkscrew, so when you open a bottle at night, you skittle the beans into a bowl and cover them with water for an overnight swell. The next morning, as you make coffee or tea, you cook them.
Apart from the soak, and the initial almost-boil, these beans really are no bother – five things gathered together, then you let the oven work its everyday alchemy. There are some who think low and slow is best. Just over an hour at 170C works for me.
So what to do with your beans? 450g of beans provides enough for two meals for four people. You could eat them as they do in Maremma, with more olive oil, bread and red wine. Alternatively, they are excellent with fat sausages. You decide whether you want them brothy, or slightly creamier – in which case puree a few beans and then mix them back in.
Then there is minestrone. Fry a soffritto of carrot, onion and celery in extra virgin olive oil. Add a diced potato, some pumpkin, a handful of kale, some parmesan rind and cover with enough bean broth and water to make up a litre. Simmer for 40 minutes and add the beans in the last 10 minutes. If you have leftover minestrone, you could ribollire – reboil and serve it over old bread for ribollita.
So there you have it: suggestions for bean eating as we say goodbye – possibly good riddance – to 2016. I am just glad my brother Ben is too busy doing three shows a day as pantomime dame to read the papers at this time of year, otherwise he might be tempted to leave an aerated comment.
Enough for two meals for four people
450g dry cannellini beans
3 garlic cloves
6 sage leaves
5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
Salt
1 Soak the beans in plenty of cold water for 10 hours. Drain and rinse the beans then return to a large ovenproof pot or casserole with a lid. Cover with cold water, making sure the water comes a good couple of fingers above the beans.
2 Preheat the oven to 170C/335F/gas mark 3½. On the stove top, over a medium-low heat, bring the beans slowly to just-before-the-boil (they mustn’t boil), skimming away any surface foam, then add the whole, unpeeled cloves of garlic, sage, a good pinch of salt and olive oil. Cover the pan with the lid and transfer to the oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the beans are tender and surrounded by just a little cloudy broth. Check the seasoning and squeeze the garlic from the skin and stir it into the broth if you wish. Serve alone with more olive oil on top, with sausages, or as part of a soup.

I’m a bit of a Scrooge at Christmastime, often choosing to give experiences over things, eschewing plastic toys whenever possible, and usually making a vegetarian meal instead of the classic roast turkey. But even I can’t deny the allure of a beautifully wrapped gift.
It’s still possible to make eco-friendly choices while also giving gorgeously wrapped presents; the holiday season truly doesn’t have to mean expensive paper and tons of waste. Each year, the US spends over $3.2bn on wrapping paper and each year Britons throw out enough gift wrap to circle the globe nine times.
Here are some ways to say bah humbug to these costly, wasteful ways and embrace a green Christmas in 2016.
This famous line from The Sound of Music sums up the happy charm of a simply wrapped gift, one that remains even in today’s over-the-top culture. It’s easy to create a waste-free version of this wrapping style by reusing paper grocery bags (turned inside out and cut to fit) or by reusing paper packaging.
Depending what look I’m going for, I’ll either let my daughter decorate the paper with her drawings, or tuck a sprig of fresh greenery into the bow. Simple, pretty and waste-free.
As a lifelong book lover, I’ve always been partial to the look of gifts wrapped in newspaper. The crisp black text on a white background lends a modern, abstract look and a thick red fabric ribbon keeps it looking luxe (I buy fabric ribbons instead of the plastic kind and also save them from gifts I receive). This is a fantastic way to use up newspapers headed to the recycling bin and kids love getting their presents wrapped in the comics section.
The Japanese practice of wrapping gifts in reusable cloth dates back to the 1600s, but it has enjoyed a bit of a comeback recently as a beautiful, waste-free wrapping choice.
Whether you’re a quilter with extra fabric scraps lying around or you want to include a scarf or tea towel as part of your gift, wrapping presents in fabric is a striking departure from thin, crinkly wrapping paper. Secondhand stores are a fantastic source for beautiful silk scarves and if you’re really handy you can even sew reusable fabric gift bags.
My daughter is a prolific artist (thankfully she hasn’t yet explored the blank canvas of my walls) so I began saving the art roll from her easel. When it’s time to wrap gifts for Christmas or her friend’s birthday parties, I use the painted paper instead of gift wrap. It’s a nice way to reuse something I’d feel guilty throwing out and our family loves seeing their gifts decorated with her wild paintings. 
Now that we’ve got gift-giving sorted, what do you do with the wrapping paper on gifts received from others?
Well, despite my affection for the rip-and-tear folks among us (who can begrudge such unbridled enthusiasm?) I have absolutely no shame in being that person who carefully peels off tape and neatly folds gift wrap for later use.
Doing so reduces waste and allows an opportunity for reuse, but another reason to save that pretty paper is because a good portion of wrapping products aren’t recyclable. 
That’s right, although it’s called wrapping paper, many kinds of gift wrap are actually made with shiny foil or coated in plastic film, rendering it unfit for the recycling bin. Same goes for plastic ribbons and bows (they’re inexpensive and pretty but can’t be recycled) and tissue paper (which is best reused or tossed in a compost bin if you’ve got one).
The best way to ensure you’re disposing of wrapping products properly is by checking with your local recycling department. A quick Google search of “[Your city/town] recycling guidelines” will let you know what your local recycling service prefers you to with these festive trappings.
Of course, the most effective way to reduce wrapping paper waste is to reduce gifts altogether. Consider organizing a secret santa exchange, getting just one or two gifts per child, and giving experiences instead of things. A certain Mr Grinch said it best:
Make a batter by beating together 2 large eggs and 300ml of full fat milk. Beat in a little salt and 125g of plain flour. Don’t worry about any small lumps. Pull the leaves from 5 sprigs of thyme and stir them into the batter then leave it to rest for 20 minutes. Set the oven at 220C/gas mark 8. Evenly brown 350g of cocktail chipolatas in a little oil or bacon fat. When they are done, add 2 tbsp of marmalade and 100g of fresh or frozen cranberries to the pan and toss the sausages in it to coat them evenly. Pour the fat, together with 3 tbsp of groundnut oil or dripping into a 22cm round metal dish or similar baking tin, add the marmalade-coated sausages and place in the oven to get hot. When the oil and sausages are really hot, add the batter and return to the oven immediately. Bake for 12-15 minutes until the batter is golden and puffed around the edges. Serve immediately. Enough for 2.
Like its sister recipe the Yorkshire pudding, this one needs really hot fat if it is to achieve any sort of lightness. Let the oil and sausages get as hot as you dare, the oil may shimmer, even smoke a little, before you add the batter in one swoosh. If a thin layer of batter firms up immediately on contact with the hot fat, then the pudding should rise well.
Pieces of pancetta or smoked bacon are good here, as is black pudding, either instead of or in addition to the sausages. If cranberries are unavailable, try small cubes of sharp apple instead.

At the start of the new year people often vow to give up certain habits such as to stop smoking, biting their nails, or eating unhealthily. But instead of working out what to quit, perhaps it’s time to think about what to take up. 
In Gretchen Rubin’s book Better Than Before she argues that our habits have the capacity to lengthen or shorten our lives. And what we do every day matters more than what we do occasionally. Rubin tested habit-changing methods on herself and on others, and found that the business of habit formation is extremely personal. 
So what habits did you take up that changed your life? We want to hear suggestions and stories. Maybe you decided to do 15 minutes of yoga every morning, or changed your commute to work so that you walked the last part of your journey. Perhaps you created limits around how much you use digital technology, or built specific time into your week to see friends? And what about eating, drinking, creativity and meditation? Tell us about the one small change that has made the biggest difference to your life.
On Saturday morning I was informed that the Mail on Sunday was going to run a story about how my 10 week-old daughter’s birth certificate didn’t include Tim Rice’s name. The father’s name had been left blank on the birth certificate.
The newspaper had evidently sent some hack around various London borough register offices armed with my daughter’s name and my full name and date of birth. And hey presto, at Westminster register office on Harrow Road, they struck it lucky. According to section 30 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953, “Any person shall be entitled to search the said indexes at any time when the General Register Office is open for that purpose, and to have a certified copy of any entry in the said certified copies, on payment to the Registrar General.”
So for the princely sum of £9.25, they will have been issued with a certified copy of the long-form birth certificate for my daughter. Exactly the same version of the certificate that I will use to apply for her passport. Let’s hope an identity fraudster doesn’t beat me to it.
I am in no way critical of the Mail on Sunday, far from it. It shows good journalism. They went out and found a story. Also in the same paper was a story about the actress Cressida Bonas’s financial assets gleaned from her company accounts. Register offices, Companies House – it had clearly been research week on the Mail on Sunday.
It is the fact they were able to do what they did that makes me shudder. What I and perhaps many people don’t realise is that the long-form birth certificate is a publicly available record. There is no 30-year rule and no special hoops to jump through to get a copy. My daughter’s full name, the hospital she was born in, her date of birth, my full name, the town where I was born, my date of birth and, terrifyingly, our current address (although the Mail on Sunday didn’t print this) are all recorded on that birth certificate, that public document.
There are two types of UK birth certificate. The short-form and the long-form. If you were born before 1983 then it is most likely that you’ve only ever seen your short-form birth certificate (the one printed in red ink). That’s because until 1983, the short-form certificate was considered evidence enough of a person’s name and date of birth. The short-form certificate is actually titled the “certificate of birth” and contains a person’s full name, sex, date of birth and registration district of birth. It is given free of charge when you register a birth. What we call the full birth certificate is actually a “certified copy of an entry on the register” and is the certificate that contains every bit of data you might actually want protected.
In the age of social media, I have long tried to keep this kind of information to myself. The year of my birth has been a thing of myth – when the papers wrote about my pregnancy back in May I was reported as all ages from 28 to 38. As a private individual, I dislike my address being publicly available. The press coverage I’ve had this year has resulted in some rather loony approaches to me via the internet. Now, any Tom, Dick or Harry can post me their missives. It seems utterly pointless to opt out of the electoral roll now. Maybe it’s easier to move.
But while I’m only slightly disturbed on the “what if?” scale, imagine a circumstance where a woman has been terrorised, assaulted or harassed. As soon as she registers a birth of her child, her abuser can find out where she lives. Surely this can’t be right? Why should the long-form birth certificate of a minor be a publicly available document?
People may argue the genealogists’ line – that it’s important for family historians to trace a family tree. But birth certificates of the very young can be changed. I have 12 months to change my daughter’s first name if I so desire. And if her father wishes to be added to the birth certificate, that too can happen. And if we both decided to change her surname, we could.
Therefore my daughter’s birth certificate could look very different in a year’s time. So why should it be a public record now? Perhaps in 18 years’ time, but the short-form certificate should be evidence enough of a birth. As a proud new mother I’ve been very careful not to annoy my friends and “over-share” on Facebook – but it seems the government does enough of that for me in the public realm.

The most festive houses in Britain – in pictures
Of all the beverages, champagne will reveal the ignoramus most brutally.
There’s the sparkling wine versus champagne debate, heated opinions about the best temperature to serve it, long discussions to be had about the most advantageous shape of the glass in which it is served, how the cork must be eased from the bottle not with a pop but with a ladylike sigh, and all manner of curious “did you know?” facts that bubble up at a table of wine aficionados. The fiddly riddling of the bottles, the legend of the accidental secondary fermentation that created the signature bubbles in the first place, the chalkiness of the terroir, the shape of Marie Antoinette’s breast, and yada yada yada, everyone’s an expert.
Except, that is, for the four Guardian Australian writers who submitted to a blind tasting of six sparkling wines of varying price and provenance. In an effort to find their inner champagne snobs just in time for Christmas (and to work out what to buy), they were guided through the tasting by the actual-expert hand of sommelier Samantha Payne of Nomad Restaurant and Wine Store.
As Payne says, when buying wines we are very guided by labels and prices, and the same labels and prices influence what we taste. So six wines were chosen with fairly loose parameters: two from Australia, two French (one from the supermarket chain Aldi), and one each from Italy and Spain. Ranging in price from $17 to $129, they were covered in foil so none of the guinea pigs could see what they were tasting or know how it would impact their bank balance. They had to rely on the senses of taste and smell only.
Just like art, it was a matter of “I don’t know much, but I know what I like”. And that’s all that matters, right? Here are their tasting notes. Cheers.
I come to champagne tasting with some set views. I don’t love the most expensive French champagnes. I find their complex, slightly dusty flavours overwhelming. I like less fashionable dry, fruity sparkling wines that cost about half as much. Or at least that’s what I tell myself when I know what’s in my glass. But a blind tasting is the ultimate test.
The first bubbly to pour from the anonymous foil-covered bottles is too sweet and acidic. It’d be OK at a picnic, but it’s not great. I give it three out of five. It turns out to be prosecco at $20 a bottle. I’ve never been a huge prosecco fan.
I don’t like the second one at all. It’s sweet and bland, a little bit Passion Pop. One out of five. Turns out to be the $17 Jacob’s Creek Trilogy and for my not particularly sophisticated palate, you’d be getting what you paid for.
The third one has a bit of that dusty taste I associate with the champagnes I’m slightly embarrassed not to love, but the fourth has that full complex French champagne flavour. I give them both a four. I figure they’re both probably French. Actually, the third was Freixenet, at $18 a bottle, and the fourth is vintage Verve at $129 – so if, like me – you are obviously not a French champagne aficionado, the Freixenet is probably a bargain.
Number six made my tongue curl. It was revealed to be a cheaper French champagne.
My favourite was number five – a lovely dry mouthful of bubbles, simpler and more subtle than the Verve, fruity and citrusy and deliciously drinkable. Five out of five – my kind of sparkling. I’ll be buying the $37 Pirie Tasmanian sparkling wine for Christmas.
My qualifications for tasting sparkling wine involve only having consumed quite a lot of it. When I moved to the UK in 2003 and discovered how much cheaper champagne was there than in Australia, I got quite carried away with the drinking of it.
Later, after a trip to Italy, prosecco became my bubbly of choice and I could afford to buy it by the caseload – to serve as an Aperol spritz with a side of olives and lightly salted crisps.
So I knew the prosecco when I tasted it, and at $20, the Santa Margherita Prosecco di Valdo is great value for money and a perfect accompaniment to our Christmas Day entree of prawn cocktails.
If I were rich (I’m not), I would have no hesitation in shelling out $129 for the vintage Veuve – as soon as I dipped my nose into the glass and inhaled the buttery aroma I knew I was on to a winner. I admired the very fine bubbles in the glass and the long aftertaste reminded me of the best chardonnays I’ve tasted. It was hands-down my favourite of the six wines and I was not partaking in any of that spitting out nonsense, let me tell you. In fact, I asked for a second taste just to make sure it was my favourite.
I had more trouble identifying the other wines but the Tasmanian Pirie was also lovely to drink and I could quite happily quaff it at a cocktail party. The fine bubbles tingled on my lips, which was rather pleasant. For me, the real surprise was the cava. At $17, the vintage Freixenet seems a steal. As for the Jacob’s Creek, well, I might be happy to drink it at a pub at midnight, after I’d been drinking since lunchtime, but otherwise pass me the sparkling water please. And the less said about the acidic Monsigny champagne from Aldi, the better.
This Christmas, I’ll be serving the prosecco with the starters and the Pirie sparkling will be filling the stockings of some people I love. 
The prosecco felt immediately very minerally and acidic – with dense bubbles and dry finish. It had me craving seafood – oily fish like salmon would could go well with something like this, that truly cuts through.
The Jacob’s Creek Trilogy Cuvee Brut – yuck – was like a Fruit Tingle lolly with too much sugar and a greasy aftertaste. It is one to have at the end of Christmas Day perhaps – after your booze stocks are depleted and your palate is tired.
The Freixenet Vintage 2013 Reserve Cava was very drinkable and I could imagine being a good thirst quencher on a hot day. We stuck our noses to the glass as one of us said, “smell the oak”. It smelt like it was made from real fruit and in a barrel – as opposed to the Jacob’s Creek, which tasted vaguely chemical.
The Veuve was the best. It was buttery and golden, slightly acidic with an aftertaste that reminded me of chardonnay. Not only would this choice be great with Christmas lunch but it’s the sort of drink that would work well all by itself, or with a side of strawberries.
The Pirie sparkling from Tasmania was similar to the prosecco and tasted acidic enough to cut through the strongest Christmas flavours – brandy butter fruit pudding, slabs of seafood, creamy pavlova. By the sixth tasting I was beginning to feel as if I’d eaten an entire roast turkey. This was a slightly sweeter blend that had a tart, almost vinegary aftertaste.
My favourite – number four – was the most expensive, the Veuve Clicquot Vintage Gold 2004 (France) at $129 a pop. But if you want something more affordable, the Freixenet Vintage 2013 reserve Cava from Spain at $17 is good value.
I came into this tasting at the distinct disadvantage of having indulged in too much cheap sparkling at an event the night before. On the flipside, when the worst stuff touched my tongue it was like muscle memory: Jacob’s Creek Trilogy Cuvee Brut is bad and should feel bad.
When I’m looking for a sparkling, I want something dry, citrusy, light and subtle – nothing challenging. I’m looking for something to drink outside on a summer evening, with a seafood barbeque and a long night ahead. Nothing too sophisticated, but taste is taste.
I really enjoyed the prosecco; it was dry and would cut through seafood, and – importantly – it was bubbly enough to refresh a mild hangover. Perfect for Boxing Day lunch.
The Pirie sparkling was a favourite too – it was interesting without being overwhelming, but I found its aftertaste a little too sweet. (I picked its price point though, which brought me no small amount of smugness.) The cava was initially great, but got steadily worse the further down the glass I got, and when I went for a repour – in a tremendous show of collegial generosity, we brought the half-drunk bottles back to the office – it tasted kind of like garbage.
I loved the depth and complexity of the Veuve, and was strangely satisfied to have picked the most expensive wine as my favourite. But if I were to shop for the booze next weekend, on taste and price the prosecco would be my pick.

When you don’t have anything kind to say about a year, you probably shouldn’t say anything at all. Far better instead to have an awards ceremony recognising the most memorable moments in a weird year for women.
On 19 May, Payne got into her car, took out a Chewbacca mask and proceeded to howl with verging-on-maniacal laughter for several minutes. There was a time when this might have got her sectioned; in 2016 it turned her into an internet celebrity. The Texan mum’s Chewbacca-chuckling was viewed over 160m times and Payne received about $420,000 (£340,000) worth of free gifts in the weeks after the video went viral.
Actually, make that the only instance of confusion between the potential closure of a legendary London nightclub and Britain’s decision to leave the EU. In September, Louise Mensch fired off some incensed tweets that muddled up the two, much to the amusement of, well, everyone. Don’t ask how or why: nobody knows what goes on in Mensch’s head before she tweets. Instead, take a moment to give thanks that Mensch is no longer an MP with anything to do with Brexiting.
In April, it was announced that abolitionist Tubman would replace slave-owning Andrew Jackson on the front of the US $20 bill. This makes Tubman the first woman in more than a century and the first African American ever to be on the front of a paper note. As Beyoncé said, always stay gracious, ladies – best revenge is your paper.
You have seen the photo, quickly heralded as an iconic image of non-violent resistance: 28-year-old Evans standing calmly in front of armoured officers at a protest against police brutality in Baton Rouge. The image was a striking juxtaposition of her flowing sundress and grace with their riot gear and guns. With the world getting increasingly bleak, it’s easy to feel hopeless. Evans is a reminder that a single person armed with nothing but courage can have a significant impact.
Immigration would not be the issue it is if they could all be like Melania.
Any Facebook rant that starts off with “CHEESE”, followed by 13 cheese emojis, is going to be gouda – but you don’t always expect it to change the world. In October, that’s what happened when one unidentified woman’s demands that vegan cheese be renamed “Gary or something ... BECAUSE IT’S NOT CHEESE!!!!!” went viral. The vegan community considered the suggestion caerphilly and decided it was great. Vegan cheese is now called Gary.
In October, Anderson brought some vegan Pret a Manger sandwiches to Wikileaks’ Julian Assange at the Eduadorian embassy and the pair lunched together. Shortly afterwards, fevered rumours began to spread that Assange was dead, murdered by the former Baywatch star with a Gary sandwich. Assange, alive and well, did little to quell these rumours.
In Italy, since 1992, someone has been selling bestsellers under a fake name: Elena Ferrante. It was basically the Panama Papers of the literary world – yet many people appear to have enjoyed Ferrante’s books, despite the deceit. Not investigative journalist Claudio Gatti, however. Outraged by all of this, Gatti “unmasked” Ferrante in October. Many people were disgusted by this invasion of privacy, but Gatti remains undeterred. His next scoop will be an exposé of everyone who raves about Ferrante, but hasn’t actually got around to reading her work yet.
Abedin has had an annus extremelyis horribilis. The long-time Hillary Clinton aide has had to deal with her (now estranged) husband, Anthony Weiner, getting embroiled in his third sexting scandal and the release of a high-profile documentary, Weiner, about their marriage. She has also been blamed for costing Clinton the election. Despite this, she kept calm and carried on.
In July, Joyce, a popular 19-year-old beauty vlogger, posted a weird YouTube video of her acting oddly as she modelled a dress. Some of her fans decided the video was actually a cryptic cry for help: Joyce had been kidnapped by Isis. The hashtag #SaveMarinaJoyce became the No 1 trending topic worldwide and the police were dispatched to Joyce’s house, where it was ascertained that, actually, it was just a weird video.
Who knew a swimsuit could divide a state? Probably not Siam (as she identified herself) when she went to a beach in Nice wearing a burkini in August. The 34-year-old soon found herself surrounded by armed police, who forced her to remove her excessive clothing and fined her for failing to wear “an outfit respecting good morals and secularism”. A country-wide row about the legality of burkini bans ensued. Because liberté, égalité, stupidité.
Taxpayers already give the Queen a £400,000-a-year alcohol allowance. You’d think that would be enough to cover a decent 90th birthday bash (street-party tickets cost £150 each) but Britain decided to go all out this year for Her Majesty. Austerity be damned.
November evening. A small soiree. James Blunt jokes to Princess Beatrice that he wouldn’t mind being Sir James. The Princess, spying a ceremonial sword, decides to knight him on the spot. Being new to the knighting thing, she misses and the un-blunt sword slashes Ed Sheeran in the face. This is not absurd fanfic, it is just another night at the Royal Lodge in Windsor.
Banks directed and produced Pitch Perfect 2. You should forgive her for this, however, because, as well as being a longtime campaigner for Planned Parenthood, Banks has been working to increase the representation of women in Hollywood onscreen and off. In April, she launched WhoHaha, a new website dedicated “to [shining] a spotlight on funny women”. Apparently, there are a few around.
Even Wonder Woman, it seems, can’t have it all. Despite being blessed with a body of impossible proportions and a superhero skillset, the comic book character was deemed unsuitable for her role as the UN honorary ambassador for the empowerment of women and girls. She lasted two months in the position.
Only £995 if you’re looking to channel Theresa May in desert-khaki this Christmas.
In November, the editor of the American Spectator, R Emmett Tyrrell Jr, helpfully racistsplained racism to author Chimamanda Adichie on Newsnight. White people hating people who aren’t white is more complicated than racism, silly! And Donald Trump is, like, so not a racist. Adichie retorted: “I’m sorry, but, as a white man, you don’t get to define what racism is. You really don’t.” You really don’t.
Due to an unexpected shortage in the world supply of women, Glamour recently made Bono one of its 2016 women of the year. He accepted with grace and aplomb. A role model for little girls everywhere.
I was recently paying my bill at a restaurant and doing the awkward “was-there-service-included?” routine when the waiter interjected: “We don’t get any of that. In fact, that service charge makes it worse because it means people don’t ever tip us.” I gave the waiter the £10 I had in my pocket and vowed never to go back.
That day I was a customer, but on other days I am a waitress. The £10 tip I gave was more than a third of what I get paid for a standard four-hour shift. It is about 5% of the £212 set menu at Le Gavroche, Michel Roux Jr’s Michelin-starred restaurant that last week admitted to pocketing 100% of service charge as revenue.
As a customer that makes me angry because, like the HMRC and 61% of the public, I assume that service charge goes straight to staff. Why shouldn’t I? Service charge is added onto my bill separately, is optional, and is not taxable. Pocketing that charge, no matter how legal or “transparent”, feels like false advertising at best, and daylight robbery at worst.
But as somebody who is also a waitress, the idea of a customer thinking they are giving me a top-up because my salary isn’t already enough to live on, but that money instead going to the people who aren’t willing to pay me a decent wage, is painful.
As a waitress, I get paid £7.25 an hour, 5p more than the minimum wage. I get paid less than the minimum income standard, which is what the Joseph Rowntree Foundation suggests is required to “live to an adequate level”. It is £2.50 an hour less than the London living wage, the amount that I would need to earn to not be in-work poverty. In short, my wage as a waitress is not enough to provide me with a basic standard of living.
And my job is hard. On a busy day, I am juggling anywhere up to 30 orders in my head at a time. Alongside the manual effort of being on my feet for 12 hours, carrying crates and stacking plates, I am constantly having to make calculations. I have to know when each order will be in the kitchen, and how long that leaves me to clean up after the table of eight in the corner, all while understanding that table 44 wants to pay now, and if they do a runner it’ll be my wages it comes out of.
I’ll be watching the clock in case a customer comes in, a minute before closing, demanding to be seated – their reason being that they’ve only just finished work. They won’t realise that what I am doing is work too.
Of course, it’s all part of my job, and there are elements of my job that I love. I get to change my hours, which gives me the flexibility to do other stuff. Sometimes I don’t work Mondays. And when I work a double shift, I do it in the knowledge that I will be surrounded by people, which is sort of like seeing people in the evening anyway.
But while some romanticise the aspects of my work that they feel make it different to a “real” job with “real” concerns, I am in fact a real person. I need to make ends meet and, while my three-hour lunch break in the middle of a double shift might look like a luxury, in reality it is spent trying to avoid spending money because, as was once pointed out to me, a coffee is a third of my hourly wage.
That’s where tips come in. I wish we didn’t have to rely on them: they make our lives unstable and they turn a lot of what makes my job enjoyable into a crude, transactional performance. But the reality is that our employers don’t pay us enough, and customers are the people that make this career financially viable.
The worst thing about Roux’s decision last week, is by now promising to mark on bills and menus that no further payment was needed, while leaving it open, in theory, for customers to leave a tip, the move is likely to deter that option for many. In a world where our employers don’t pay us enough to live on, the least resturants can do is to allow waiting staff to benefit from the good grace of other humans.
Reports that a German-backed international school in Istanbul had scrapped Christmas festivities briefly caused outrage on Sunday and Monday, before the German foreign office said there had been a misunderstanding and that the school was allowed to teach Christmas traditions after all.
Set up in 1884, Istanbul Lisesi is a Turkish-German bilingual state school attended solely by Turkish students but partly backed by the German government. Thirty-five German teachers at the school are paid for by German taxpayers, but the headteacher is nominated directly by the education ministry in Ankara.
According to Spiegel Online, several teachers at the school said they had been told to no longer teach about German Christmas traditions in their classes, as well as being told to remove advent calendars from the classrooms.
“We don’t understand the surprising decision by the management of the Istanbul Lisesi,” said the German foreign ministry in an initial statement. “It is too bad that the good tradition of pre-Christmas intercultural exchanges at the school with a long German-Turkish tradition has been suspended. We are of course taking this up with our Turkish partners.”
The school denied the ban, which was first reported by the respected German news agency dpa and followed up by the media in Germany and abroad.
“The reports in German media about restrictions on Christmas festivities of German teachers do not reflect reality,” it said. “A concert was cancelled by the German teachers in question without explanation. There is no question of the school or its management placing an obstacle in its way or prohibiting it.”
Mustafa Yeneroğlu, an MP with the ruling AKP, also denied the claims, saying “such false reports do nothing for Turkey-Germany relations”.
A spokesperson for the German foreign ministry said on Monday afternoon that there was no “ban” on teaching Christmas at the school after all and that “hopefully all misunderstandings have been resolved”. By then, many German politicians had reacted with fury to the initial reports.
Julia Klöckner, a deputy chair of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic party, said the incident was a sign of Turkey closing itself off from the outside world: “Those who want to restrain free thinking in this way are so ignorant, they must be capable of worse.”
Sevim Dağdelen, a politician with Germany’s Left party, told Tagesspiegel the government must “immediately summon the Turkish ambassador and send a note of protest to Ankara”.
The Greens’ education policy spokesman, Özcan Mutlu, said the reports were “simply shocking”.
Andreas Scheuer, the general secretary of the CSU – Merkel’s Bavarian allies – said the reports were “new proof that [President Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan’s Turkey is burning all bridges with Europe”.
Christmas is part of Germany, and that applies too for a German school abroad, Scheuer told the Funke regional media group.
Relations between Ankara and Berlin have been strained in the wake of the failed military coup in July, with Germany repeatedly expressing concern over the scope of a massive crackdown on Erdoğan’s opponents.
Developments in Turkey have a strong resonance in Germany, home to a 3-million-strong ethnic Turkish population, the legacy of a massive “guest worker” programme in the 1960s and 70s.
What should I wear to my boss’s Christmas party tomorrow night?
Zzzzzip! Record scratch! Sorry to interrupt, folks: normal service will be resumed next week, but this week we celebrate the festive season by going through the best and worst fashion moments of the year. Honestly, it’s what Jesus wanted us to do. He said so, right after he ticked off John the Baptist for his hopelessly passé robe. “Bias cut is soooo BC, John,” he said, as the two of them strolled along the river Jordan. Maybe. I might be less clear on my New Testament than my Vogue.
Let’s start with the downers. Well, it was a strange year. Breasts, for a start, we consigned to the bin. Vogue decreed that cleavage was “over”, and the adoring shots of Elizabeth Debicki’s frequently bra-strap-free back in The Night Manager seemed to confirm this. Rather sweetly, Vogue tried to pretend that theirs was a feminist declaration: “The tits will not be out for the lads. Nor anyone else, for that matter.” How marvellous! No longer will women suffer the tyranny of Eva Herzigova because a whole new body shape will be celebrated. Hurrah for the inclusivity of fashion! Go feminist fashion! Bog off, boobs!
Wait, what’s that noise? I think it might be a giant “EXCEPT” coming down the pipeline. EXCEPT perhaps it is because Vogue lives in an airless world populated only by the underfed and underweight but it seemed, rather sweetly, to have forgotten that not all women need Wonderbras to manage more than a C-cup. Breasts are not, in fact, just some novelty accessory we’ve been dabbling in, like Carrie necklaces or turbans. Going unsupported is not an option for some of us, at least not without giving ourselves two black eyes. So what to do for us, the unlucky few left with unfashionable breasts that can’t simply be slammed away in a drawer? One broadsheet had the answer: “How to dress when you hate your breasts,” read its headline. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is I believe what’s known as coming full circle.
We also hit peak athleisure, with the arrival of Chloé’s £1,000 tracksuit, a joke straight out of Nathan Barley. There was also peak squad, with various female celebrities clamouring on social media to show off their popularity, holidays and fat-free bodies, from Taylor Swift’s overly Instagrammed 4 July party to Cara Delevingne’s hyperbolically Instagrammed Maldives holiday. Confusingly, we also hit peak peak, so it is of utmost importance that someone come up with the 2017 word for something being over (“basic” is definitely over, as, incidentally, is over).
All right, quit your complaining already, woman! What has been good this year? Glad you ask, I reply to myself. Well, by some measure, my favourite fashion(ish) news story of the year was the undoubtedly totally true one about Kate Moss dumping her boyfriend, the great great grandson of Otto von Bismarck, after he switched off the Wi-Fi in Moss’s home during an argument, meaning her teenage daughter couldn’t use Snapchat and Instagram. You can imagine how that went down with a 14-year-old. Try to find one element in that story that doesn’t bring you some modicum of amusement. I know! You literally can’t! Anyway, young Von Bismarck and Moss are back together so not only is this story hilarious, it also has a happy ending. Whether Moss’s daughter feels the return of the Wi-Fi killer is a happy ending, however, is as yet unknown.
Otherwise, the year was really about two labels – Vetements and Gucci. My much-beloved colleague Jess Cartner-Morley wrote about Vetements’ year last week, so indulge me instead in my Gucci obsession. Put it this way: there are two kinds of fashion fans: the cool ones, and the ones who get distracted with funny things such as embroidered leopards and purple shoes. If you are cool, you like Vetements, and if you are more in the latter camp then you are a Gucci person and God bless you and Gucci’s designer, Alessandro Michele, for it. Fashion hasn’t been this fun since Marc Jacobs used to be fun.
The return of the 90s has been quite amusing-slash-traumatic for those of us who remember the 90s very, very clearly. There’s something about seeing a teenager in a slip dress and jumper to make you muse on your youth. And there’s nothing like realising said teenager wasn’t even alive in the 90s to make you realise how long ago the 90s were.
Finally, I’d like to end this retrospective column by bidding a sad farewell to a fashion item I very much hoped would be a part of all of our lives for the next four to eight years. I speak, of course, of Hillary Clinton’s pantsuits. Remember them? One in every colour! So cheering, so dependable. Never mind your politics (although you’re reading the Guardian, so who are we kidding here?), wouldn’t you rather be seeing those pantsuits on the news than that orange face and tonsorial monstrosity? My heart hurts just thinking about those pantsuits, to be honest. So forget about those Hadid sisters: 2016 was about the pantsuit. But not 2017, alas.
I’m a bit sick of people droning on about how governments and elites have failed to grasp the reasons for popular discontent. I suspect that they’ve known the reasons all along. They knew the discontent was coming, but they didn’t care – because they planned it.
Who but the elites decided that robots should take over human jobs wherever possible? They must have known that it would be like a gargantuan game of musical chairs: keep taking away the chairs and the people end up on the floor. And God forbid that a foreigner should end up with the last chair – the people would be outraged.
But that’s all part of the plan: provide a poor education for the people so that they can’t think very well for themselves, don’t build enough houses, then tell the indigenous residents that foreigners are to blame for stealing their work and homes, are terrorists, or health tourists, or lazy and peculiar, and they’ll believe you, even if you tell them huge porkies, because they’re exhausted, frazzled and need someone to blame – and you, as rulers, are meant to know what you’re talking about.
And, by the time the truth comes out, limping along behind, the lies will have done their work and it will be win-win for you lot in charge, because now that you’ve got so many people hating foreigners, you can more easily turn away refugees who try to escape from appalling wars (which you probably helped to cause) because you’ve now got fear and xenophobia well established. Then you can say: “The public want their country back,” as if it’s everyone else’s fault and you can only do what your constituents ask you to do.
Best of all for you elites, the people will be so befuddled by lies and so busy squabbling among themselves that they won’t even mind if you rule them from a castle, ivory tower or golden baroque-rococo palace.
But I hope, with all my heart, that very soon your cover will be blown and we will have happier years in the future.
What is a dog’s favourite television programme? Sadly for Christmas crackers everywhere, it’s not likely to be Woof Hall. According to the commendable work of scientists at the University of Lancashire, dogs prefer watching Coronation Street to anything else, including clips of other dogs playing.
The researchers placed two labradors in a controlled, home-like environment and showed them 12 clips of 20 seconds each. They then collated the responses, looking at attention times and at which of the three screens the dogs looked. In order to replicate the science, I also created a controlled environment and let my whippet lie on the sofa with me while I watched television.
My experiment suggested that she is a big fan of Planet Earth II, particularly when birds feature, and especially that bit in the final episode where the langurs do a simian version of parkour across the rooftops of Jodhpur. Continuing our family tradition of enjoying drunk nanas falling over at weddings and sunburned dads jumping into – and breaking – paddling pools, she is also a big fan of You’ve Been Framed. She briefly paid attention to Netflix’s new show The OA, but only when Steve’s dog barked at Prairie. She would rather sleep through The Young Pope.
The University of Lancashire study suggested that, ultimately, dogs simply are not as interested in watching stuff as they are in eating, sleeping and playing. But I spoke to several dog owners who disagree: “She watches EastEnders with me but I don’t think she truly appreciates it.” “Really likes the cricket.” “Wasn’t allowed to watch Springwatch because he went so berserk.” “I once made her a Barcelona kit to wear while watching the Champions’ League final.”
Furthermore, my study concluded that in no way are dogs’ viewing habits connected to the fact that watching stuff involves lying on warm humans on a comfortable sofa.
Zsa Zsa Gabor, who has died at 99, isn’t really being remembered for her film roles, which were minor. Instead, she is being celebrated now for one major performance. Being Zsa Zsa Gabor. She created the role, and she lived it, playing it to perfection. This Hungarian woman – who lost her virginity at 15 to Kemal Atatürk, the founder of modern Turkey – rose from beauty queen to actor, then became a TV personality and full-time celebrity.
In the staid 1940s and then 50s, Zsa Zsa, a green-eyed blonde, became a hugely entertaining presence, poured into extravagant gowns accessorised with diamonds, furs, tiny dogs and the exaggerated “Dahlink” she used to address everyone. It was her lifestyle rather than any talent that kept her in the public eye. Of course, people were interested in her nine marriages but it was actually her wit and cleverness that kept the show on the road.
Zsa Zsa was one of the first people to be famous for being famous, ushering in the new era of celebrity. To call her a proto-Kardashian though is to underestimate her charm and her stamina. My mother and her friends loved Zsa Zsa because at a time when women were meant to be passive and grateful to be married at all, Zsa Zsa was always talking about marrying for money rather than romance: “Diamonds are a girl’s best friend and dogs are a man’s best friend. Now you know which sex has more sense.” She married nine times and divorced seven. “I’m a great housekeeper,” she quipped. “Every time I get a divorce, I keep the house.”
Her excessiveness was part of her “brand”. Flaunting conspicuous consumption, dripping with jewels, her image was that of a woman who knew how to get what she wanted. And before the 1960s and the sexual revolution, she was open about liking sex. Her lovers included Sean Connery and Frank Sinatra, and she claimed to have spurned the advances of John F Kennedy, Elvis Presley, John Huston and Henry Fonda. Greta Garbo once kissed her “straight on the mouth,” she said. “And I couldn’t help kissing back because she was so overwhelmingly strong and beautiful.” When asked how many husbands she had had, she used to say: “You mean other than my own?”
Although her actual husbands included the actor George Sanders and the hotelier Conrad Hilton, she lived in a world of self-parody, gossip and knowingness about the lifestyles of the rich and famous. She was adored rather than resented because she was always tipping us a wink.
Beneath the glamour, as with so many of these female stars, we now sense the power, control, and sheer stamina they needed to keep going. Zsa Zsa was a woman who could laugh at herself and her embodiment of that special kind of female camp; she was her own special creation. In her heyday, if she turned up at a premiere, she would get more attention than the stars of the film. She certainly knew how to work it, as they say, even proffering advice to other women in books that included How to Catch a Man, How to Keep a Man, How to Get Rid of a Man.
Gabor once described herself as unconventional and true to herself. Therein lay her fabulousness. She was arch about both love and money. She was acerbic, flamboyant, she kicked against tradition and sometimes won. Like many women of her generation she understood that femininity is always a performance, and she performed it to the hilt. She was always winning, never a victim. As camp as Christmas, her seeming frivolity hid the sharpness and strength that made her name.
Sometimes, after I publish a story, I’ll receive a couple of emails from readers who want to share their thoughts. But one project I worked on this year with Mae Ryan, a four-part video series called Vagina Dispatches, prompted hundreds of you to get in touch.
One episode in particular got people writing to us: Stopping Periods. There were very different reactions to it, but one message we received often was that the video left some questions unanswered.
We really wanted to respond to your questions and concerns (though the series is supposed to be fun to watch, it’s also supposed to be informative since so many of us with vaginas don’t know enough about them), so we put your questions to Dr Deborah Ottenheimer, a New York-based gynecologist with 20 years of medical experience and a human rights activist.
DO: It’s true that biologically, women used to have many children starting quite early in life. Social evolution has changed that scenario for many of us, particularly in the economic “north”. It is absolutely true that women who are constantly either pregnant or nursing don’t have their periods as often.
But I’m not sure that the fact that many of us choose not to live that way means that our periods are not natural. It just means that social evolution moves faster (or differently) than biological evolution.
DO: The key to checking to see if there is something to be concerned about is to use a period tracker (or be old-fashioned and plot it on your calendar). That helps to document whether a change is actually just a new monthly pattern or whether there really is something weird going on.
Signs to look out for that need evaluation by a medical provider are:
DO: The range of normal is large. A normal cycle length can range from 21-45 days. What we look for is a fairly regular period pattern in a single woman; a woman who has her period after 21 days one month, 45 days the next, and 22 the next needs to be checked out. A woman who has her periods every 21-23 days is fine, as is a woman who has her period every 42-45 days. On average, a woman’s period should last no more than 7 days. Some women have a moderate amount of bleeding every day; others have heavy bleeding one or two days, and then spotting for a few more. Both are OK. It’s worth noting that women’s periods change with age. Often women will see a real pattern emerge around 22-25 years old. Changes seem to happen again around 30 and again in our 40s and finally as we move towards menopause. Some women will develop spotting at the time of ovulation for a few months or years. That’s OK.
DO: Some women prefer to have a monthly period, while others do not. Both are OK. Many women with menstrual problems like excessive bleeding or pain, or endometriosis, or menstrual migraines or menstrual psychosis, are helped tremendously by skipping their periods.
What is not OK is to not have periods when you are not on some sort of hormonal contraceptive. Generally, we recommend seeking the advice of a medical practitioner if more than three months have gone by with no period. That may indicate some sort of illness. It can also lead to the abnormal buildup of the uterine lining and, occasionally, that can lead to endometrial cancer.
Women who have a chronic illness, a hormonal imbalance, or severe eating disorders (to name a few) will often have disordered periods. When they go to the doctor/medical practitioner with that symptom, the underlying problem can be searched for.
DO: A whole generation of medical providers in America was taught that IUDs caused all sorts of terrible things. They don’t, and they never did as a group. Just one, the Dalkon Shield, was bad. About 5%-10% of women will expel their IUD – that is to say, their uterus will push it out. Usually, you know because there will be abnormal cramping/bleeding or a partner may feel the plastic shaft during intercourse/fingering. Those women who do expel the device can still have another one placed. There is about a 15% risk of expulsion.
The risk of uterine perforation (punching through) with IUD placement is real, but rare. Situations in which it is a little more common include women who are immediately post-partum (ie have just had a baby) or who have multiple fibroids. In 20 years of practice, I have placed literally thousands of IUDs and had only one woman with a perforation.
Modern IUDs do not cause infertility.
DO: Endometriosis is a state in which the lining of the uterus (called the endometrium) grows outside of the uterus. There are a lot of theories about why this might happen but in fact, no one knows the reason behind it.
Bleeding into the pelvic/abdominal cavity is quite painful. It also causes scarring and chronic inflammation. As a result, longstanding endometriosis can cause scarring of the tubes and lead to infertility. The scarring can also lead to bowel obstruction and chronic pelvic pain in severe cases. The symptoms vary a lot in severity and location depending on how bad the disease is. Treatment ranges from stopping your period – with the pill, Depo-Provera or Mirena IUD – to surgery.
DO: PCOS is a very common endocrine disorder arising primarily from insulin resistance/poor metabolism of glucose (so it’s a risk factor for diabetes as well). The resistance to insulin leads, through a series of chemical reactions, to an excess of testosterone.
It’s important to remember that it’s called a “syndrome”, not a disease, to emphasize the fact that there is a whole range of severity out there. Not every woman presents in the same way. The diagnosis is made when a woman has two of the following three signs/symptoms: infrequent or absent periods; elevated testosterone on a blood test or physical findings of elevated testosterone; and/or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound.
PCOS manifests itself through signs of elevated testosterone like acne, excess hair growth in places women don’t expect to get hair, and male pattern baldness. Irregular or absent periods are also common. Many women with PCOS have great difficulty losing weight as well.
DO: I have two sons, a male cat, and a husband at home but if I had a cis girl, this would be close to what I would want to say:
Having your period can be inconvenient at times, but it is just how we are built. Having sex with your period is OK too. That women are shamed and seen as unclean when they have their menses makes me furious. Women are the force that allows our species to continue. Without monthly bleeding, there would be no future for humanity. End of story. How men (and religion) have turned that on its head and made women feel badly for their bleeding is beyond me. We should be honored for it.
When is a cape just a cape? Rarely, as proven by Ben Mendelsohn’s baddie in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. In his role as Director Orson Krennic, a middle-management imperial lackey, he has turned the off-white cape into a real takeaway from the new film.
It’s worth restating the obvious at this point: Star Wars bad guys usually opt for black. But, rather than blindsiding us with its political correctness, the white cape is actually a triple power move. The colour is Cornforth White from Farrow & Ball, a mid-tone, off-white shade, which was the colour of 2016 for people in positions of power. It’s what Hillary Clinton chose for her final-debate pantsuit, is a similar shade to Melania Trump’s jumpsuit worn to her husband’s victory speech and is Michelle Obama’s favourite dress colour. Also, capes are the root of shoulder-robing, that peculiar frow-friendly trend for wearing your coat on your shoulders, leaving your hands free to text or wield the lanyard to the Death Star. And they have been a consistent coat trend for the past five seasons, worn by Solange to her 2014 wedding, and most recently seen on the Gareth Pugh catwalk. The giveaway here is that the model wore sunglasses indoors while modelling.
As Mendelsohn has explained, it is significant as a performance tool as well as a prop: “It gives you a dignity and an uprightness that you might not have had otherwise. It’s the sign of a great costume.”
A white Christmas is looking unlikely, according to forecasters who predict 2016 will end with a spell of unsettled but mild weather.
The festive season will probably pass without snowfall, while daytime temperatures are expected to stay above freezing. As 25 December approaches, people across the UK should expect wetter and windier conditions, but are unlikely to need a sleigh.
A Met Office spokesman said: “It’s relatively a long distance away still, so obviously there’s a fair amount of uncertainty. But it’s looking like it will probably be relatively mild, so unlikely to see much of a white Christmas.”
He said there may be local variations, with the possibility of snow on mountains in Scotland, and that while overnight temperatures could drop below freezing in some places, it will remain mild during the day.
The Met Office outlook for the next six to 30 days in the UK suggests Friday will start with local frost and some patchy fog in the south, but will turn unsettled from the west through the day.
“This will herald a changeable and at times very unsettled spell of weather as we move through the Christmas period and towards new year.
“A succession of deep Atlantic depressions will bring bands of heavy rain east across all parts, although sheltered eastern and south-eastern areas should see some reasonable drier interludes too.
“Winds will often be strong, with periods of gales, and the potential for some stormy conditions at times in the north-west,” the Met Office website says.
Now that it’s less than a week to the big day, let’s talk Christmas Day runs. What’s your tradition? The other day I was chatting with someone, explaining that myself and the other half usually go for a longish, rambly run together before picking up the breakfast croissants and pain au choc treats. “Blimey” she said, “Don’t you even take Christmas Day off?” I was a bit nonplussed, before I realised that she meant that for her, running was simply a chore - and if there’s one day you don’t do chores, it’s Christmas Day.
But if you love running, why wouldn’t you do it on the one day of the year where you are almost guaranteed no traffic, good company, smiley faces (yes, even in London!) and a vast amount of food later on? It’s pretty much my favourite run of the year. Though I admit that I may be alone when it comes to my other personal tradition of a truly evil track session on Christmas Eve morning ...
But back to the weekend that’s just gone. Any PBs to report? My long run moved to Saturday due to party-hosting duties (happy birthday today to my very own junior parkrunner!) and I’ll say this for getting 20 miles out of the way by Saturday lunchtime - it gives you plenty of time to eat recovery cake ...
Share your own tales of weekend triumphs and woes - and plans for Christmas Day running - below the line as always.
Because he would not abandon the flock for a lost sheep
after the others had bedded down for the night,
he turned back, searched the thickets and gullies.
Sleepless, while the flock dozed in the morning mist
he searched the pastures up ahead. Winter nearing,
our wool heavy with brambles, ropes of muddy ice,
he did not abandon the lost sheep, even when the snows came.
Still, I knew there was only a thin line
between the good shepherd and the butcher.
How many lambs had put their heads between the shepherd’s knees,
closed their eyes, offering their neck to the knife?
Familiar – the quick thuds of the club doing its work.
More than once at night I saw the halo coming.
I ran like a deer and hid among rocks,
or I crawled under a bush, my heart in thorns.
During the day I lived my life in clover
watching out for the halo.
I swore on the day the good shepherd catches hold,
trying to wrestle me to the ground and bind my feet,
I will buck like a ram and bite like a wolf,
although I taste the famous blood
I will break loose! I will race under the gates of heaven,
back to the mortal fields, my flock, my stubbled grass and mud.
The scenes in the windows of 2016’s Advent calendar seem particularly dark and bloody. As usual, we rush for the friendly binary oppositions, and line up the butchers versus the dwindling breed of good shepherds. But what if good shepherd and butcher are one and the same person?
For this week’s poem, an old parable transformed into wiser truth and timelier warning, we’re revisiting the work of Stanley Moss whose Almost Complete Poems will be published in January. Moss, born in 1925, continues to write poems that combine wit, imagination, humane politics and a spiritual vision innocent of creed and dogma. In The Good Shepherd, originally published in his 2003 collection, A History of Color, it’s not the unrepentant sinner we should fear, but the unrepentant saint.
Jesus recounted the parable of the good shepherd in Luke 15: 3-7. It was his response to a scolding from the pious for his association with “publicans and sinners”. The shepherd in the parable is no Bo-Peep (“leave them alone, and they’ll come home”, the nursery rhyme advises). He abandons, at least temporarily, the 99 well-behaved sheep of his flock so as to search out the single one that has strayed. The lost sheep represents the sinner, of course, and the good shepherd, God. The parable is intended to correct the self-righteous, and cheer the outsiders with a vision of God’s magnanimity. But a sheep’s-eye view might regard the good shepherd as a little obsessed.
It’s in the penultimate line of the first of the three stanzas that the use of the possessive plural pronoun “our” signals the narrator’s identity. It’s not just any sheep, either; it’s the lost sheep, although we might not realise this until the next stanza.
A calm, hexameter rhythm and measured tone at first prevail. The sheep even seems coolly approving. Line seven echoes and amplifies line one, a reflection on the shepherd’s spotless record. The poem gives us realism as well as the fantasy of an eloquent sheep, vividly evoking the grainy discomfort of the weatherbeaten animals, “our wool heavy with brambles, ropes of muddy ice”. Poor, patient sheep, huddling together for comfort while the shepherd heads out into the blizzard, we think.
In the second stanza, the tone changes: it’s no longer that of a calm public utterance. The voice is more agitated and colloquial. “Still, I knew there was only a thin line / between the good shepherd and the butcher.” It’s a fair point, but a surprising one and it marks the moment at which the poem splits decisively from the Bible story. When we reach the statement, “More than once at night I saw the halo coming”, we know for sure: this sheep is on the run. And we taste a little of its fear.
From the stray sheep’s point of view, the shepherd has an ulterior motive, caring for the flock only to reduce it to profitability. The lambs submit bravely: the death is administered almost lovingly, but it’s still death. The poem gives us both the knife and the club – and it notes that the “quick thuds of the club doing its work” are “familiar”. This implies other victims, closer in time and place – civilians caught in some warzone, perhaps, the “thuds” those that rain down from the sky, or people otherwise brutalised and rendered into things. So this clever sheep has got out of the way, and intends to stay out, relishing the freedom but also constantly “watching out for the halo”.
The effect of this synecdoche is both sinister and comic. Our sheep has a certain sense of humour. But the dread of the pursuing “halo” is real and sharp, registered in shorter lines and quicker sentence-bursts. When the creature crawls under a bush, and tells us his/her heart is “in thorns”, there is no doubt of the analogy being drawn. It’s not the good shepherd who is Christlike, but the rebel sheep.
The last stanza declares the intention to fight fiercely, “taste the famous blood” (ie Christ’s), break loose and return to freedom. The rhythm is urgent, kicking and biting until the escape into expansive joy at the end. The sheep’s salvation would be its death. “I will race under the gates of heaven, / back to the mortal fields, my flock, my stubbled grass and mud.” Earth, not heaven, is all it desires.
The problem the poem discerns is one at the heart of the great religions. Their conventional message, even when the preacher is as radical and refreshing as Christ, always promotes the same ultimate goal, insisting that the true life is not of this world. The Christian God miraculously becomes incarnate at Christmas, and shares our mortality, but the intention still is to lead us to that other, immortal life. Heaven’s unimaginable perfection and stasis are the true creation.
The sheep in The Good Shepherd takes the pragmatic view. Heaven is here on earth. It can be harsh, stubbly and muddy, brambly and icy as well as clover-sweet, but it’s what we have. Haloes are dangerous when they tell us otherwise. At best, the good shepherd will kill you humanely and send you to market. Watch your wool. Have a happy Christmas!
I’ll never know how many people liked this article, shared it or found it irrelevant, anti-progressive or ironic. Nor will I get to read comments about my personal hygiene, or suggesting that a luddite like me needs to embrace industrialism. And that is no bad thing, for the moment writing becomes a popularity contest – rewarding sensationalism, groupthink and deceit over honest exploration of complex matters – people and places lose, and those who need to be held to account win. Win, that is, for a shortsighted moment.
The reason I won’t see any web reaction is because I live in a cabin – built with spruce, oak, hands, straw, Douglas fir, stubbornness, earth and knees – without electricity or so-called modern conveniences (I’ve never found doing the work to buy and maintain them particularly convenient).
From Wednesday, I’m rejecting the world of complex technology entirely. That means no laptop, no internet, no phone, no washing machine, no tapped water, no gas, no fridge, no television or electronic music; no anything requiring the copper-mining, oil-rigging, plastics-manufacturing essential to the production of a single toaster or solar photovoltaic system.
Having already rejected these industrial-scale, complex technologies, I intend to move fully towards what is pejoratively called primitive technology. Insofar as engaging with civilisation allows, I’m also trying to resist the modern domination of what Jay Griffiths, in Pip Pip, calls clock time – and failing daily.
That probably sounds like I’ve given up a lot of stuff. But while I intend to be clear and honest about the difficulties involved over the coming months, especially in the digital age, I’m just as fascinated in exploring what lessons about life – myself, society, the natural world – I might learn; perhaps things my cyborg-mind cannot yet imagine. That was my experience of living without money for three fine years.
Rejecting technologies that my generation considers to be the basic necessities of life wasn’t done on a thoughtless whim. I already miss not being able to pick up the phone and talk to my parents. Writing is different, my pencil unaided by both copy-and-paste and the easy delete, two word-processing functions reflective of a generic, transient and whimsical culture; and it has been a while since the media and publishing worlds worked by snail mail.
I decided to eschew complex technology for two reasons. The first was that I found myself happier away from screens and the relentless communication they generate, and instead living intimately with my locale. The second, more important, was the realisation that technology destroys, in more ways than one.
It destroys our relationship with the natural world. It first separates us from nature, while simultaneously converting life into the cash that oils consumerist society. Not only does it enable us to destroy habitat efficiently, over time this separation has led us to valuing the natural world less, meaning we protect and care for it less. By way of this vicious technological cycle, we are consciously causing the sixth mass extinction of species.
Technology destroys places. Aside from the oceans, rivers, topsoil, forests, mountains and meadows, it helps us massacre and pollute with ever-improving precision and speed, its complex set of cogs quickly spreads us out all over the world, safe in the knowledge that we can stay in touch with loved ones via technologies that offer what is really only a toxic substitute for real connection and time together. It is badly injuring, perhaps fatally, rural communities, luring their youth into industrial and financial centres – cities – whose existence is premised, as the American writer and environmentalist Wendell Berry said, on the devastation of some other far-flung place, which consumers don’t have to look at thanks to the out-of-sight, out-of-mind distance afforded by technology.
When I walk to the spring to collect water in the morning I meet neighbours and we talk. Yes, it takes time, something I found frustrating at first, but slowness only became a bad thing when time became money. Walking four miles to the post office to send my letters takes time too, but it ties me to people and place in a way that sitting in my bedroom on my own, writing endless emails, could never do.
Technology destroys people. We’re already cyborgs (pacemakers, hearing aids) of a sort, and are well on our way to the type of Big Brother dystopia of the techno-utopians. And look at the state of us. Our toxic, sedentary lifestyles are causing industrial-scale afflictions of cancer, mental illness, obesity, heart disease, auto-immune disorders and food intolerances, along with those slow killers, loneliness, clock-watching and meaninglessness. We seem to spend more time watching porn than we do making love, relationships are breaking down because we stare into screens instead of eyes, while social media are making us antisocial.
Living without complex technology has its own difficulties, especially for people like me who were never initiated into those ways. But already I much prefer it. Instead of making a living to pay bills, I make living my life. Contrary to expectation, my biggest issue is not being bored, but how to do all the things I’d love to do. Of course hand-washing your clothes can be a pain sometimes, but that minor inconvenience is hardly worth destroying the natural world over.
Well-intentioned friends often try to convince me to go off-grid, but in using batteries, electrical cables and photovoltaic panels (as I once did), I would still be connected, by a peculiar sort of invisible cable, to the global network of quarries, factories, courtrooms, mines, financial institutions, bureaucracies, armies, transport networks and workers needed to produce such things. They also ask me to stay on social media to speak out about the technology issue, but I say I’m denouncing complex technology simply by renouncing it. My culture made a Faustian pact, on my behalf, with those devilish tyrants Speed, Numbers, Homogeneity, Efficiency and Schedules, and now I’m telling the devil I want my soul back.
My life has its fair share of irony, and it can look hypocritical. Despite originally writing these words (a technology) with a pencil (a technology) in a hand-crafted cabin (a technology), the irony of this being an online blog is not lost on me. That is my compromise for now, for if you want to contribute to a healthier society, compromise can be a healthy thing if you know your boundaries. Being a hypocrite is always my highest ideal, as it means I’ve set higher standards for myself to strive for than I’m achieving at any one moment.
We know that, at the very least, some technologies are harming our natural world, our societies and, ultimately, ourselves. Therefore we can recognise the need to reject some technologies. If we’re to avoid technological extremism we’re going to have to draw a line in the sand somewhere. I’ve drawn mine, and I will only move it in the direction of my home.

 Sheila and John Gill began hanging decorations and fixing thousands of lights over the August bank holiday. The lights, which completely cover their house and garden, will stay switched on between 4pm and 8pm each day until 31 December
The former MasterChef host Michel Roux Jr has begun reimbursing staff who were paid less than the legal minimum wage at his £212-a-head Mayfair restaurant.
Current and former chefs at Le Gavroche are in line for payments running to thousands of pounds each after a Guardian investigation last month exposed Roux for paying kitchen staff, who worked up to 68 hours a week, as little as £5.50 an hour. The wages worked out at well below the £7.20 legal minimum for people aged over 24.
Roux has now written personally to former chefs apologising for their underpayment and promising to make up shortfalls in their pay. He has also sent four-figure cheques to others, which are arriving just in time to fund an upgrade from Christmas Day cava to champagne for some of his hard-pressed former workers.
Roux wrote: “It has been brought to my attention that some ex-staff may have been underpaid and this may affect you. If this is the case then please accept my apologies and reassurance that this was not intentional.” He asked former staff to “confirm any shortfall that may be due”.
A spokeswoman confirmed that letters had been sent out and said: “Of the people he has been in contact with in the kitchen team, he will settle with everybody who feels they have a legitimate claim and he will honour it.” Roux now faces a bill running into tens of thousands of pounds. One former chef told the Guardian he will tell Roux he is owed close to £8,000.
Another former chef quoted from Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol in describing Roux’s repayments as “a fair, even handed, noble adjustment of things”. “But,” he said, “it was an adjustment of an unfair, underhanded and ignoble practice in the first place and it was forced. These issues will persist in the restaurant industry unless they are challenged by staff and the public.
“It is not OK. Chefs and waiters should expect to be paid at least that required by law and customers should be confident staff are well treated.”
The move came exactly a month after Le Gavroche chefs blew the whistle on their low pay. They revealed that while they were preparing dishes such as the £60.80 butter-poached lobster with almonds, peas and a bisque sauce for guests including Paul McCartney, Adele and the Queen, they were working between 62 and 68 hours a week for £375 before tax.
It was described as “simply not acceptable” by the Sustainable Restaurant Association, led by rival Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc. One former chef at the restaurant said that while Roux was in many ways a supportive employer, the pay was “disgusting”.
Roux’s friends, meanwhile, rallied to support him. They included the restaurant critic Jay Rayner, who said that while underpayment of the minimum wage was wrong, Roux was “not quite the anti-Christ” and was “a good employer”. Rayner said the problem of underpayment in the restaurant industry was “systemic”.
Roux had said that despite being hands-on at the two-Michelin star restaurant, he had not noticed the long hours some of his kitchen staff were working and said “in no way was it done intentionally”.
Some chefs are understood to have been wary of approaching Roux directly to ask for missing pay for fear that such a move could affect their career prospects. Roux is an influential figure in the UK restaurant industry, with numerous former Gavroche chefs running top kitchens. They include Gordon Ramsay, Marco Pierre White and Marcus Wareing. But Roux appeared to head off any such fears, saying requests for back pay would be handled confidentially by his restaurant’s payroll department.
“I think it is brilliant he has done this,” said one former chef who is preparing to lodge a substantial request for back pay. “It would be nice if other restaurants did the same, as I am sure many others are paying beneath the legal minimum.”
Underpayment of the minimum wage is punishable by a fine levied by HMRC, and last night Frank Field MP, chairman of the House of Commons work and pensions select committee, called on Theresa May to order HMRC to investigate Le Gavroche.
“What better opportunity for the prime minister to offer low-paid workers some Christmas cheer?” said Field. “If Mrs May were to ask HMRC to identify all of the staff who were underpaid by Le Gavroche, and order that they be repaid their lost earnings, other high-end restaurants might think twice before ripping off their own staff.”
Last week the Guardian also revealed that Le Gavroche has been keeping all the discretionary 13% service charge it levies on customers bills and does not distribute it to staff on top of their wages. Roux responded by abolishing the charge and increasing prices by 13%. He said this would clear up any ambiguity about what the service charge was for.
On Friday he tweeted: “Never touched tips in my life, every penny goes to staff without anything withheld. All SC [service charge] goes to wages, not a penny creamed off either.” He recently changed his Twitter avatar to an image of one chef punching another.
His tweet appeared to foster more confusion, with several people saying service charges shouldn’t be used to pay wages. Roux defines tips as cash or card payments over and above service charge which he has treated as restaurant “revenue”.
Sensorwake, £100
Sensorwake is an intriguing alarm clock that wakes you not with sound, but with an aroma of your choice (as long as your choice is croissant, espresso or the seaside). The reusable capsules and heatless, dry-air diffusion fill a room with scent in two minutes. I don’t know about yours, but when my body has been promised a croissant it doesn’t receive, it shuts down. Right down. However, I hate audio alarms – I prefer a vibrating bracelet. This could be a interesting sensual addition. There’s scope to add a vastly greater array of scents. My favourite smells are old books and fresh sweat, but not together.
Hangover cup, £8
Those who have gone all out, travelled fully downtown, got blotto in the grotto, may be more in need of the hangover cup. Warning: this is not a product that suggests quiet dignity. It looks like it may have come from a vet’s office. It holds a litre of water, and it’s spill-proof, spouted and double-handled, so it can be fully inverted for drinking on the horizontal. It doesn’t feel great to be an adult who drinks out of a sippy cup because they can’t hold their Breezers, but reflecting on your immature choices is what January is for, right? 1 January of never.
Molecular gastronomy kit, £40 
There’s something sad and sweet about a cook who recently learned foaming technique and is now forcing Bovril suds with deconstructed toast on everyone. But that’s me, now that I own this box of frogs. I love the – let’s be frank – wankery of molecular gastronomy. The molecular gastronomy kit includes syringes, pipettes and silicone tubes, plus sachets of natural texturising agents, such as agar-agar and calcium lactate, and a DVD of 50 recipes. Once you’ve got a handle on spherification, emulsification and gelification, you can play around with recipes such as yoghurt ravioli, lemon clouds and balsamic pearls, like a sorcerer whipping up a fantasia. To me, the kit and its techniques are alien and wondrous – a sort of ET foam home, if you like.
Tog knives, from £100 
I have said – quietly, because it undermines this entire column – that a good knife is the only kitchen gadget one needs.* Tog knives are good – and they let you pretend to be an enigmatic assassin, AKA my favourite hobby. They’re created by a British designer, but hand-forged in Japan, based on the folded construction of Samurai swords, incorporating 21 layers of stainless steel and copper. The knives are strong and incredibly sharp – they bisect tomatoes as if they were made of hummus. The antimicrobial copper laminae resemble geological strata in the blade, while the handle is made of a hardwood alternative called Kebony, which is funny and beautiful to look at. They’re breathtakingly expensive, but ideal for filleting fish, vegetables and enemies.
* In addition to a powerful blender and an apron with joke abs on it.
Nescafé Dolce Gusto Eclipse coffee machine, £170 
Nescafé’s advert campaign for their new range of pod-coffee machines may have shot itself in the foot, as it features colossal self-regardist will.i.am remixing soul classic Sitting on the Dock of the Bay to banal effect. But let’s not judge their unwise alliances – let’s judge the strange shape of their machines. The Eclipse looks like a starship had relations with a doughnut and returned to earth to dispense hot drinks. Upon touch-activation, the device breaks its perfect circle smoothly, like an ouroboros taking time out from infinity to spew macchiato from its neck. There are capsules for café au lait, espresso caramel and Marrakech tea, among others; the ones I tasted tasted good. The airy digital controls will alienate some and excite others. If you’re down with pod coffee and have one of those brushed-metal kitchens out of Fifty Shades of Grey, prepare to whip yourself into a frenzy. If you own a tea shop in the Cotswolds, don’t.
Libratone Q Adapt on-ear headphones, £219
Whenever I host a party, there invariably comes a tipping point at which I wish everyone in my house were gone. It’s a problem compounded at Christmas, when one’s home is full of undesirables and children. I have three life-changing words for you, or two including the hyphen: noise-cancelling headphones. Libratone’s Q Adapt are the most elegant I’ve tried, with four ANC (active noise-cancellation) settings and clever, touch-sensitive cans that let you skip tracks, adjust the volume and take calls. They even know when you’ve taken them off, automatically pausing and resuming music. Let the mental duvet descend, my friends.
Yester home nutcracker, £35
If the option of domestic vigilantism is still important to you, keep this premium nut cracker/shell catcher on hand. It’s a cast-iron vice that could crush a diamond, let alone a macadamia. Made by delightfully named ironmongery Yester Home, it’s the heaviest thing in my house right now.
Amano tongue scraper, £10 
What to get the man or woman who has everything? How about the rank insinuation that they have halitosis? I like this product’s commitment to being disgusting. The press release for the Amano describes the tongue as a deep-pile carpet of bacterial debris, and the proposed benefits of tongue scraping include a deeper appreciation of flavour, as well as the reduction of “STDs residing on the tongue”. (Other sexual health products are available, thank God.) Their models resemble artistic hand-strengtheners, with patterned handles, a triumphant sweep of steel and names including Ophelia Rising and Savile Row. Lord love ’em, they’re as classy as the concept will allow.
Chef’n Twist’N Sprout, £8
The brussels sprout stripper is another gadget that, as one friend accurately assessed, has been specially designed to have no transferable uses. But he found it worked well, hulling brussels’ and opening up their leaves for a better boil. What’s most charming, though, is the name: Twist’N Sprout. While food is the most direct way to my heart, wordplay definitely opens the back door. “Twist to trim and core,” reads the packet, like a pilates instructor for miniature cabbages. If you’re in need of a gift that says: “I put very little thought into this,” in addition to: “Now make my dinner,” this is your guy. Also, screw you. Happy Christmas!
Recommended by Anne Fine, author of Madame Doubtfire, Goggle Eyes and Flour Babies
The Frog and Toad books are perfect gifts. Children of three to five adore these wry, intelligent and gentle stories about two very different friends. Frog is patient and modest. Toad is not. But together they face the problems any child will recognise: ice‑creams that melt too fast, an overpowering inability to get out of bed, lost buttons, failure of will power, and all the myriad misunderstandings, anxieties and triumphs of small busy lives.
The illustrations are a restful, greeny-brown delight. There’s nothing brash and cartoony about these stories. Though written as simply as fables, the wry humour makes them appeal to a wide age range. No adult I know ever tires of reading them aloud. I’ve seen grown men reduced to tears of laughter by Frog and Toad’s confusions.
It’s an old-fashioned adventure story, but set in a modern London estate. The adventure takes place over one night, when the characters go on a mission to the other side of the city. It’s set against the backdrop of a riot – people are looting shops and the town centre is a no-go area. Throughout the book there’s a threat of violence, and it deals with topics such as sexting, which aren’t very well represented in the usual books on the GCSE syllabus. The dialogue and conversations between characters are so vibrant – I have no idea if that’s how young people talk on estates in London, but it felt authentic. I was blown away by one of my pupils’ responses to the book – he went away and made his mum order the earlier story, Liccle Bit. He hadn’t read a book for five years.
Recommended by Julia Donaldson, author of The Gruffalo, Room on the Broom and Christmas with Princess Mirror-Belle
E Nesbit was the inventor of the modern children’s adventure story. Less well known than Five Children and It or The Railway Children, this to my mind is her most imaginative book. Three siblings discover a secret tunnel that leads them to what they believe is an enchanted castle, though its princess, Mabel, is just as ordinary as they are, despite possessing a ring that can make you invisible.
The most powerful part of this book is when some creatures called the Ugly-Wuglies, whom the children make out of coathangers and umbrellas and broomsticks, come to life. They have no roofs to their mouths, so when they speak, “Can you recommend me to a good hotel?” comes out as “Aa oo re o me me oo a oo ho el?” It is terrifying yet funny at the same time.
Recommended by Lucy Worsley, historian, broadcaster and author of Eliza Rose, a novel about the Tudor Court for readers of 11 and over
A classic bit of historical children’s fiction. I’m amazed when I reread it just how closely she followed the Tudor sources. The story starts with a christening procession that saw the future queen watching her baby brother, Edward VI, being taken by torchlight through the galleries of the palace to the ceremony in the Chapel Royal. It was just one of Plaidy’s many historical books with young female protagonists that were catnip to an introverted nine-year-old like me. My own copy, with its picture of Hampton Court Palace on the cover, is undoubtedly one of the reasons I’ve ended up working there as chief curator.
This is a lyrical picture book where we follow a young girl who takes a little boy on an adventure through books. It’s about how fiction opens our minds and opens doors to other places. There are beautiful illustrations combined with extracts from classic literature and lullabies. Even though the text elements of the story are short, there’s a joyous celebration of language within it. The use of classic texts such as Treasure Island has made the children want to explore those books – we’ve had to buy more classic text for our library because of it.
This book is set in 1919 and it’s about a girl called Henrietta. It’s shrouded in mystery at the beginning so you don’t really know what’s happened, but you know there’s been an accident and that she had a brother who has died, and that they’ve moved away to the country and mum is ill. It’s a real page turner – I finished reading it in one night when my son went to bed. He’s 10 but I would say it’s suitable for children of nine-plus. There are lots of words where my son would ask “what does that mean?”
Recommended by Alex Wheatle, author of Crongton Knights, winner of the Guardian’s 2016 children’s fiction prize
It’s a rollicking story, with lots of historical education. The main character’s father is sent away because he’s charged with a theft, and so the son has to prove his father is not guilty. He has to fight the social prejudices of the day – prejudices against poor people – to prove his father is innocent. It shows the injustice of 200 or so years ago for somebody of colour, and it’s about the imbalance of power between rich and poor, and about someone trying to fight against injustice. It’s so relevant to today, and that’s why I really enjoyed it. It’s also very educational – not many people are aware, especially school children today, that black people did exist in north Devon and places like that in the 17th or 18th century.
Recommended by Jo Clarke, librarian at Whitchurch C of E primary school, Hampshire
This is such a lovely mix of historical and contemporary stories and it captures all the excitement of the season – the frozen Thames, wondrous elves. It features people such as Berlie Doherty, Jamila Gavin, Geraldine McCaughrean, so it’s got classic writers, but also lots of contemporary writers.
The reason I love short stories is that they introduce children to new authors. Children often get stuck in a rut – “I’m just reading everything by Jacqueline Wilson.” When you give them a short story anthology it opens a whole new world. It’s suitable for a child around seven, or a child a bit older than that could read independently.
I’m a sucker for both rhyming couplets and any “mean person finds joy and love through the magic of Christmas” story, so How The Grinch Stole Christmas! – Dickens with a fluffier antagonist – is in constant demand in my family every December. The jaunty, singsong style of Dr Seuss is entrancing and comforting, especially for children, but it’s the warmth and the heart in this story that make it so unforgettable (along with classic insults like “you have termites in your smile”). No child or adult should go through a winter season without at least one visit to Whoville.
It’s easy to forget the brilliant characterisation in these stories. They’re about a girl who gets into trouble constantly, but her moral development as a character comes about as a result of her making mistakes. She learns to deal with her own vanity and pride. They’re timeless books and the things that she goes through – feelings of loss, abandonment, feeling like you don’t fit in – most young people experience today. Considering it was written in the early 1900s, it’s still incredibly relevant. There’s a remake happening of the TV series, so it’s going to come back into the public eye.

It’s about a school for wizards, so that may sound familiar. What is astonishing about the book is that Le Guin’s definition of magic and how it works is strangely convincing. You have to really understand something – to know its real name – before you can control it. The hero, Sparrowhawk, has therefore to find the real name of the shadow that is haunting him.
It’s a book full of magic and adventure – it has unquestionably the best map of any fantasy book. But it’s also full of beauty and a wisdom that I still draw on now. It would be the gift that keeps on giving.

This book it had a profound effect on me. I believe any child experiencing adversity, rejection or that feeling of not belonging will find solace in this book. It will also make them realise they are not alone, as it covers many of the issues children are facing today.
Those who suffer from depression or mental health problems, because of the unhappy situations they have to endure, will find this book will empower them to feel worthy and not to allow events to ruin their life, as it will reassure them that it is not their fault when people behave cruelly.
It’s a classic book that inspires readers. It fires up the imagination and takes the reader on an unforgettable journey.
Paul Stewart’s delightful tale of discovering your own special talents, even though they may be different from those around you, is brought to life by Jane Porter’s beautiful collage illustrations. Penguin’s deepest desire has always been to fly but everything goes wrong. It is only when penguin falls into the sea that he discovers a different way to fly. This heart-warming picture book shows children that everyone has something they’re good at. It’s simply a matter of finding what it is.

I loved this book. Pushkin Children’s Books are to be congratulated in making it available to an English audience. How important it is, in these times, that our children read the stories from other peoples, other cultures, other times.
Set in Tokyo just before the second world war, the Little People, Bilbo, Fern and their children, Robin and Iris, live on a shelf in a dusty room full of books and are cared for by the Moriyama family. The Little People have been entrusted to the Moriyamas by an English teacher, Miss MacLachlan, who has to leave Japan after 20 years’ teaching English as the war comes closer. There is a strong sense of place and the changing seasons are beautifully described. While the story has elements of the work of Oscar Wilde and Hans Christian Andersen, the author admits to having been inspired by Kenneth Grahame and Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.

It’s a short novel, suitable for ages nine- to 13, written as a series of poems. The narrator is Lonnie Motion, an 11-year-old boy whose parents died four years previously in a fire and whom, having spent some time in “group home” now lives with his foster mother, Ms Edna. His teacher encourages him to “write it down before it leaves your brain” and so sets about writing a series of poems through which we learn of his feelings about the loss of his parents, his separation from his sister and the people in his life who show him love.
Woodson captures the language of a young African American boy who is determined to make sense of his world. I was struck by how well I felt I knew the other characters in the book just through their appearances in Lonnie’s poems. The warmth and optimism of the book shines through without ever feeling forced.
This is a collection of stories about Richard Feynman, one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century. It’s all about how he got into physics and the fun he had doing it. Some stories are more serious – he was involved in developing the nuclear bomb – but a lot are about how he played with concepts and was always open to new ideas. The book challenges the sense that there’s a canon of material one must learn to master the subject – it’s about mindset, creativity and fun. It’s accessible to 15- to 16-year-olds who are interested in physics.
Zoo-ology was published the month my eldest child was born, and has been a family favourite for eight years. Each spread is a safari for the senses, crammed with Joelle Jolivet’s striking animal prints. Her artwork is captivating at any age – bold enough to appeal to babies, and beautiful enough to tempt you to tear out and frame the pages. The book is a wonderful way to start talking about biodiversity, but most of all, it’s fun. When my boys were little, they sat on the pages playing animal hide and seek and spotting the hidden chameleons. Now eight, six and four, they gather around to invent their own versions of I Spy and Guess Who? Older children can pore over well-chosen facts about the featured creatures, tucked away at the back.

I’m mixed race and there weren’t any books that appealed to my ethnicity. It was the first book I connected with. It explores the idea of racism by reversing the superior race and having the black community as the ruling class. The main story line is a white boy and a black girl who are friends and they end up falling in love even though the odds are against them. The themes are more prominent in today’s society than ever – you’ve got racism, terrorism, friendship and war. The school I teach in is quite diverse, and when the Black Lives Matter protests were happening over the summer last year, I used this novel to explore the issue more deeply.
’Twas the morning of Christmas Eve, a busy day for Father Christmas. I’d just left the church after my role in a service featuring the cast from the nearby panto and was eager to return the outfit I’d borrowed. Suddenly I became aware of a young boy, girl and their mother rushing after me, mum asking if I’d say a quick hello to her children. Father Christmas never refuses such a request, so I was happy to comply.
“Father Christmas, Father Christmas,” said the daughter excitedly. “Before I came to church today I did a poo.” Acutely aware of mum’s embarrassment but loving daughter’s unguarded spontaneity about something so natural I responded, quick as a flash, “Well, what a coincidence – so did I.” The honesty and openness of children is one of the real joys of the job.
Although I’ve told inquisitive “clients” I’m as old as the hills but younger than the mountains, it was in 2006 when I first donned the beard, gold-rimmed spectacles, red coat and hat of my alter ego. I’d worked in several temporary jobs for my local council, and its events organiser, aware that I had acting experience, offered me the role for its annual ceremony where Christmas lights are turned on in the city centre by a “celebrity” and a large crowd turns out for a feast of fun and entertainment. The job was well-paid and the council would supply the costume and my size 12 wellies. What was not to like? The event went swimmingly, we all had fun and I made a point of not knocking off until the last Santa enthusiast had left for home.
I was to perform at this event for the next five years but it is in the grotto that Father Christmas really pays his dues and earns his corn. My first such gig was in a department store. On the first day my elves and I stood in the shop window, surrounded by toys. The elves were young, inexperienced students and felt a bit silly. But I loved it, particularly standing motionless as a mannequin then moving suddenly to startle passersby.
For the first couple of weeks the children were still at school and there were few grotto visitors. Instead, I was encouraged to wander around the shop, entertaining customers. Everyone from the Marx Brothers to the staff of Grace Brothers have exploited the big store’s comic potential and though I can’t claim such a pedigree, I had great fun surprising people on the escalators and taking a break in the vibrating massage chair. I also got to chat with children, parents and pensioners – always in character – in the store’s various restaurants.
The next year’s grotto was in the garden centre where there were – whisper it quietly so the kids don’t hear – two Father Christmases, one in each room of a large garden shed, which formed part of its range. In between was a reception area where we played our favourite Christmas songs and the ever-helpful elves steered our “clients” through one door or another. I’ve heard since of grottos with even more Santas as venues try to ease the often large queues that build up. I would often be encouraged to speed up the visits to ease the wait but always felt that each “consultation” should take as long as it needs for each individual child. I never want a child to leave until they’ve had a positive experience.
Children’s wish lists can be long or short, simple or works of art, expensive or complicated. They cover everything from the latest must-have toy, to a series of Argos catalogue numbers. I’ve even been asked for “a little brother”: mother and I gave each other a look. I never make a promise. I only say that I will try my very best. That’s all that any of us can do.
Personally I think of Father Christmas as a kind of holy fool, old and wise, young at heart, quite old-fashioned, but above all a kind, generous and fun-loving friend to all children, irrespective of any particular faith or none. He embodies the spirit of the nativity story’s unconditional love but also embraces a whole host of pagan and folkloric midwinter drinking and feasting traditions from around the world. He’ll happily accept proffered gifts of mince pies, sausage rolls or Christmas cake, carrots or other goodies for his reindeer, and a range of liquid refreshments encompassing whisky, brandy, port, hot chocolate, glass of milk … or a can of Stella.
He loves goodness, of course, but hopes that adults will demonstrate it too. He tries hard to be good himself but acknowledges that it can be jolly difficult to be good all of the time. And if a parent attempts to make presents dependent on giving up a comfort such as thumb or dummy, he will recall how he, as a youngster, had a similar habit that, one day, he managed to give up. Just like that.
Am I paid what I’m worth in this role? Usually not, particularly if I’ve just spent an hour with 20 children and I’m soaked with sweat. That beard and wig, if your own hair doesn’t do the job, can make things particularly hot. And then there are the times I’ve had to turn down better-paid work because I’ve committed to the grotto. Saying that, I have on occasion rejected a better hourly rate in another grotto when I felt the set-up was too much like a conveyor belt or too heavily scripted. I love to improvise and children improvise too.
What about the other rewards? For the heart, the soul? Well, the smile of a happy child is priceless. As are the words of a serial grotto visitor who tells me that I’m the best Father Christmas they’ve ever met. Of course, I’m the real one.
“Burnt-out cars, drug dealers and bums – there was nothing else here.” Balder Lehmann, a 25-year-old professional skatepark builder, is standing beneath a bridge in northern Copenhagen. “It wasn’t the nicest part of town,” he says, explaining why locals used to avoid the area.
For Lehmann, though, the location was perfect. Last Christmas, using surplus concrete, wood and reinforced steel bars, he began building a skatepark. Over the course of a few months, he and his friends constructed three adjoining sets of ramps.
With its wooden frames filled with rubble and coated in 15cm of smooth concrete, Lehmann’s skatepark is much like the ones he builds for clients – typically municipalities around Denmark – with one exception: it’s illegal.
Lehmann never sought permission from Københavns Kommune, the council that owns the land he built on. And it may not even matter – thanks to the city’s liberal approach to urban development, and the role of skateboarding.
Dubbed Underbroen (“Under the Bridge”), Lehmann’s construction is a prime example of a DIY skatepark – built quickly, cheaply and illicitly, often in a neglected part of the city such as an abandoned building. Reclaiming the city is a motive, too. DIY skateparks often try to revive long-forgotten urban spaces, thus making them busier, livelier and safer.
DIY skateparks exist in many cities, not just Copenhagen. The cluster of ramps and bowls built in the early 1990s below Portland’s Burnside Bridge is widely considered the first of its kind. Yet no city is as open-minded about their construction as the Danish capital.
A case in point is Hullet (“The Hole”) – a deep concrete bowl built in Copenhagen five years ago. Its creation is steeped in myth. In 2010, an American construction company called Grindline was hired to build a new concrete skatepark in the city. Legend has it the company’s burly builders passed on their expertise to local skaters, who scoped out a suitable location and started digging. Over the course of a year, they dug down two metres and piled up the displaced earth to make the hole deeper, before constructing a smooth concrete bowl.
Inevitably, their activity attracted the attention of the council who got on the phone to a man named William Frederiksen. As well as managing Copenhagen’s largest indoor skatepark, he works for the council’s culture department as a kind of ambassador for skateboarding. Frederiksen says his colleagues wanted to know why the skaters were digging such a big hole, and feared someone might fall into it.
But when he explained what they were doing, the council changed its tune. “They said, ‘OK, we love it and we want to keep it – but we have to figure out some kind of deal,’” Frederiksen explains. Instead of stopping the diggers, the council insisted they put up a fence.
According to Frederiksen, the council’s open-mindedness about Hullet – and subsequent DIY skateparks such as Underbroen – reflects its broader vision for Copenhagen and the role that skateboarding can play. “It wants the city to be lively, noisy, agile and progressive – and it’s thinking in a different way about how to use city space,” he says.
One measure of the council’s progressive approach is that it consults skateboarders such as Frederiksen when it redesigns public squares and streets, to make them suitable for skating. Tolerance of DIY skateparks is another reflection of its ethos.
One of the architects of that vision is Simon Strange, a member of the Social Democrats, the left-leaning party that controls the council. Elected to city hall a decade ago, he has pushed for increased support for skateboarding – such as funding CPH Open, an annual street-skating competition. He also applauds the development of DIY skateparks.
“You want to have people being active and engaging with their city,” Strange says. “Even though people are changing public space for their own purposes, they do it with love and positive energy because they want to create something.”
In particular, Strange welcomes their regenerative potential. “Very often they’re in places that nobody cares about, areas without attention, so they’re creating something out of nothing,” he says. “Even though it isn’t always completely legal, sometimes you have to lead the way as a citizen.”
Balder Lehmann agrees. “We could have asked for permission but the council might have said no,” he says. “Then what would we have done?” Eventually, of course, his skatepark came to the attention of the city’s technical and environmental department – and Anders Melamies, in particular, who leads the division responsible for streets and parks in northern Copenhagen.
Strictly speaking, Melamies says, he should have called in the bulldozers. But last year the technical and environmental department adopted a strategy known as Fælleskab København (Co-creating Copenhagen). Its vision is to develop the capital in collaboration with anyone who uses it – residents and tourists alike – to turn it into a “living city … a city with edge”.
In that light, he says his job is to find a way “to create space for skaters in a way that doesn’t interfere with other citizens’ use of the city”. With Underbroen he decided he had three options: “We could tear it down; we could leave it, close our eyes and hope that nothing happens; or we could get in touch with the people using it, and try to find a lasting solution.”
He chose the third option. “If we can explain our issues and have a dialogue, hopefully we can solve them and legalise what they have built,” he says. “It’s an impressive creation and a lot of time has gone into it. I would hate to tear it down.”
Still, the city’s open-minded approach to DIY skateparks doesn’t guarantee their survival. A skatepark built in an abandoned building on the outskirts of Christiania, the infamous free-town, is on borrowed time. Next year the building will become the new home of famous Danish restaurant Noma.
Hullet’s days appear numbered, too. In April, the city decided to turn the area into a “green residential district”, with 69 family homes scheduled to be built by 2019. No mention was made of Hullet.
Daniel Mathew teaches at the Academy for Untamed Creativity – a school that seeks to motivate teenagers to re-enter formal education. He has helped students build three DIY skateparks and insists on getting prior permission from landowners. He says it’s a shame that Hullet’s builders failed to do so.
“They never started a conversation with the guys who own the land and now it’s going to get torn down,” he says. “In two years, it’s game over. It’s a perfect skatepark and it could have been there for 10, 15 years. But that’s the DIY way – it comes and it goes.”
Lehmann stopped building Underbroen in the summer. Having spent 50,000 DKK (£5,660) on it, he’s hoping to get retrospective permission – but is prepared to remove it if he doesn’t.
“That’s the gamble. If it gets torn down, that’s how it is,” he says. “But if it does, believe me, something else is going to get built – because there are a lot of people who want to build their own thing.”

For Stephen Waters, the festive season is a time of transformation – when he leaves behind his normal line of work, dons a red suit and becomes Santa Claus. 
The beard, made of realistic crepe wool, has to be prepared the night before he’s due to wear it, and takes about two hours to attach. The outfit includes a jacket lined with satin and £40-a-metre fur, spectacles, leather boots and white gloves. In his hand, he carries a candy cane walking stick and an enormous pocket watch that opens to reveal moving reindeer. A musical tricycle, lit by 300 lights as he rides into town, completes the look. “From the moment I step out the door, I’m in character,” he says. “And I don’t break character until the end of the day.”
Waters – who goes by the name of Magical Santa – is one of many self-employed Santas appearing at parties, corporate events and grottos around the UK in the run-up to Christmas. Such is the demand for this iconic character that individual Santa services are competing with Santa-for-hire agencies, while Santa schools are offering training in the ways of the great man.
One of these schools is the Ministry of Fun, set up 20 years ago by James Lovell, a year after he first became Santa himself. He came to the role almost by accident, after being asked to step in at the last minute for someone who had fallen ill. He quickly realised that the job wasn’t quite as simple as it looked. Encountering a shy child who needed to be put at ease, he was able to improvise (thanks to a background as a street performer and clown), but spent a lot of time afterwards researching Santa to make sure he had things to talk about.
“I’m always ready to talk about the reindeers,” he says. “And you need to be able to discuss the very important issue of a child who doesn’t have a chimney. When you’re Santa you’ve got to be ready for anything. You’ve got to be supremely comfortable in the role.” His company, which trained 38 people this year, is now the UK’s number one provider of Santas.
It is, arguably, the most seasonal job in the world, and every Santa will have skills elsewhere that keep the money coming in for the rest of the year. Those on the books at the Ministry of Fun have a wide variety of professions including teacher, football coach, tour guide, flood damage restorer and cold-call salesman. Out of season, Waters is an sculptor, artist, busker and handyman. But there is “good money” to be made in Santa, says Lovell, with bookings for appearances typically starting to come in as early as August.
Waters makes enough money during the festive season to keep him going for about six months, and has this year turned down about £6,000 for December because he doesn’t have enough time to take on more work. He notes that a standard rate is usually about £100 an hour, although the exact amount will depend on the client and nature of the booking.
Most of his Magical Santa business has come through word of mouth, much of which Waters attributes to his work as a “Street Santa”. This involves him setting himself up on Southend high street, with a sign saying ‘Donations Welcome’, and inviting families to come over. It’s a decent source of income – takings range between £80 to £160 for a few hours – and doubles up as an opportunity to hand out business cards.
Steven Wickham, also known as The Real Santa, takes a different approach. Work usually comes via his website, although he has also dabbled with other types of marketing: paying for a promotion on Facebook and contacting his local newspapers in Buckinghamshire for publicity. This is his second Christmas as a Santa-for-hire and, while business seems to be growing steadily, he notes that it’s a competitive area.
But Wickham also has a couple of advantages when it comes to being Santa – he’s got what he calls “the real stuff” in terms of appearance, and has played Santa on several occasions in his job as a professional actor. His credits include Father Christmas in TV’s Mrs Brown’s Boys, the 2013 Littlewood’s Christmas advert, and he is currently appearing on Italian TV for mobile network TIM’s festive campaign. Wickham has already found that having an authentic beard counts for something among some customers, with a recent booking coming through for that very reason. 
There are, however, challenges other than physical appearance. One of these is a tendency by children to ask difficult questions. “The trickiest questions are the saddest ones,” says Lovell. “I was once asked if daddy could come home for Christmas – that was pretty tough. Even worse was when a child asked if I could make their little brother better. Santa doesn’t need to get involved in any of that – it’s not Santa’s job to be a counsellor, so to speak – so you’d quickly say something like: ‘I’m sorry you have troubles, but I’m Father Christmas and I’m going to make sure you have a great time this Christmas.’ Always go positive.”
Practical safeguarding issues are also a consideration. Many Santas now come with a DBS check, although this is not a legal requirement for the job, as well as public liability insurance. More generally, there are some good practice rules to be followed. In his conditions of booking, Waters stipulates that there must be two adults in the room with him at any one time, that he’s there to entertain rather than babysit, and that he isn’t left alone with children at any point.
And then, of course, the role of Santa comes with another significant responsibility: to keep the magic alive. “You hear tales of grumpy old chaps in the department store and of people who were scared of Santa for years,” says Wickham. “So I do strongly feel that you need to have the right kind of twinkly character. Because you’re messing with children’s minds. They still believe it’s real, and it should be. There are very few characters out there who can actually make people happy like Santa does.”

With the bright lights, colourful gifts and jolly presence of Father Christmas, Santa’s grottos are a seasonal favourite for families across the UK. But not all children are able to enjoy them.
For thousands of children in Britain diagnosed with autism, the trip to sit on Santa’s knee can be a frightening mix of huge crowds and loud noises, a charity has said.
This year, dozens of autism-friendly Santa’s grottos have opened around the UK, launched by parents who want their children to be able to join in a magical part of Christmas without feeling distressed.
Instead of the huge queues, which can induce panic in some children with autism, the grottos have scheduled appointments or host only small groups. There are no flashing lights, Santa has been trained and the loud music has been replaced with a sensory room where the children can relax.
Jo-Ann D’Costa-Manuel, founder of the charity Autism Parent Empower, said more than a thousand parents had contacted her to say they were thrilled about her launch of an autism-friendly Santa’s grotto in Crawley, Sussex.
“For some families this will be the first time they will get the opportunity to experience the magic of Santa with their child,” she said. “For other families, who feel extremely isolated and misunderstood, they are comforted that awareness and acceptance is now unfolding into the mainstream and nationwide, too. A parent contacted me to say this was the first time in nine years she was able to take her son [to the grotto] – now that is what Christmas spirit is truly all about.”
Lynn Westerman Holt said taking her 11-year-old son, Alexander, to the local Santa’s grotto was a “disaster” for years. “The noise of the crowd, the heat of the crowd, the smell of the perfume, the flashing lights. That’s when you see the meltdown,” she said.
There is also anecdotal evidence that the autism-friendly grottos may be helping some children who find it difficult to communicate. Westerman Holt, who helped set up an autism-friendly grotto in the Yorkshire town of Wetherby, said she cried when Alexander – who has nonverbal autism – was able to talk to Father Christmas.
“Although he’s now 11 and neurotypical 11-year-olds probably don’t believe in Father Christmas any more, he almost didn’t have any concept of Christmas until he was six or seven,” she said. “Now he’s getting the real wonder and magic of it. He believes he’s really talking to Father Christmas.”
Westerman Holt helped launch her local autism-friendly grotto three years ago with the charity Autism Angels. What started with 20 children had this year grown to 100, some of whom travelled more than two hours to visit Santa.
She added: “When you’re the parent of a child with autism you do feel very isolated because Christmas is supposed to be a really magical time. It’s supposed to be like it is on the TV and the movies and everyone’s playing happy families. That heightens the difference between your family and the typical family – it is quite lonely and it is heartbreaking.”
Kerrie Stephenson set up a similar Santa’s grotto in York after her three-year-old son, Jack, was diagnosed with autism earlier this year. About 45 children attended and the idea proved so popular that the parents are planning autism-friendly Easter egg hunts and a Halloween event – without the scary costumes.
“I had parents crying, telling me it was the most relaxed the children had been, people weren’t judged,” she said. “I’ve had lots of parents saying to me it was awful queueing, their child screaming, too many people dressed up. We didn’t have any music on and the only person dressed up was Santa.”
Daniel Cadey, autism access development manager at the National Autistic Society, said: “It is really heartening to see people making autism-friendly Santa’s grottos. Like anyone else, autistic people and their families want the opportunity to join in Christmas festivities. But many children on the autism spectrum rely on routine and their sensory sensitivities mean they can find the busy, loud and unpredictable environment of Santa’s grottos disorientating and overwhelming.
“Our Too Much Information campaign highlights the need for greater public understanding of autism, so autistic people and their families aren’t left socially isolated. The loud music and crowds – even the look and feel of lots of decorations – can make public spaces during the holiday period particularly overwhelming, so it’s fantastic to see businesses and individuals taking it on themselves to make the often small adjustments necessary to create autism-friendly alternatives that allow autistic children and their families the chance to take part in their local Christmas cheer.”
It’s a sign of the chasm between television and film that when a film has a female lead, or is a story about the lives of women, it is still considered both a curiosity and a potential risk. It’s hard to imagine a fiasco as daft as the one surrounding the Ghostbusters reboot taking place had it been a series. Present-day television is more democratic and open to new ideas, and, as a result, this year’s glut of nuanced and complex stories about women has been astounding. While complicated masculinity had its own champions – Grayson Perry: All Man, Louis Theroux’s documentary about alcoholism, the oddball despair of Flowers – women have been on the frontline of the year’s most innovative shows, as creators and stars, and often both at the same time.
A six-part comedy about self-loathing and loss made for an unlikely most likeable show, but Fleabag was a disarming victory for a damaged, disturbing fable. The titular Fleabag grimly destroys the people around her as if compelled to do so by an unknown force; we viewers are taken in as her confidantes and shown sex, family and friendship through a deadened, grieving heart. The anti-heroine has been around for a long time, but writer and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge wove new threads through that tapestry and told a version of young female life that incorporated truths about promiscuity, loneliness and never feeling good enough. Remarkably, it was also very funny – you can charge what you like in a guinea-pig-themed cafe, apparently – not least in showing the always-lovely Olivia Colman as a thoroughly nasty piece of work.
There’s been a lot of humour in despair throughout the year, which certainly feels appropriate for 2016. “Troubled” women can be overused to tepid effect, but 2016 saw traditionally dramatic areas such as mental illness and mourning turned into witty and inventive comedies. Netflix’s Lady Dynamite, starring cult standup Maria Bamford, told a version of her hospitalisation for a bipolar disorder and subsequent return to showbiz with a surreal elegance. Meanwhile, Tig Notaro’s One Mississipi found the blackest of humour in the similarly semi-autobiographical tale of Notaro’s return to her home town after brutal cancer treatment and the death of her mother. Transparent, though stretching the credulity of its “comedy” billing, continued to deliver the extraordinary complexity it established over its first two seasons. While Maura explored the shifting boundaries of her identity, the rest of the cast addressed their own limitations, and between Rabbi Raquel’s wavering faith and Shelly’s transformative one-woman show – which gave Alanis Morissette’s 90s hit Hand In My Pocket a new lease of life – it was the kind of sucker-punch TV that lingers in your mind and your heart.
Maura and Shelly’s tussle over a maternal role was one of many examples of motherhood at the centre of the story. Better Things, written by and starring Pamela Adlon, and co-created by Louis CK, dramatised Adlon’s life as the single mother of three young girls, and her all-female household – with a scene-stealing, over-the-top turn from Celia Imrie as the dotty English grandmother – was beautifully touching and frank. The pilot for Motherland, by Sharon Horgan and Graham Linehan, explored a scabrous world of competitive middle-class parenting and has been deservedly picked up for a full run next year. While it gave us a fine young girl superhero in Eleven, Stranger Things was ultimately driven by a mother’s hunt for her missing son, with Winona Ryder reclaiming a little of her iconic past as the frantic, fairy-light-loving Joyce Byers. The Scandi-noir-esque new series of The Missing zipped through a breathtakingly intricate plot of abduction and war crimes flanked by a story of motherly love and determination. We even got to see the reality of balancing a family life with a demanding career in American Crime Story: The People vs OJ Simpson, in which Sarah Paulson’s Marcia Clark was given the fleshed-out humanity she has long deserved.
In the big blockbusters, too, female characters were given equal billing. Having long been accused of treating its women with disdain – a not unjustified complaint, given its earlier lackadaisical attitude to rape scenes – Game of Thrones spent much of this season leading its female characters to victory: Arya over the waif; Daenerys over the slavers; Sansa over Ramsay Bolton and Cersei over everyone (she had a lot of revenge to do). Westworld, a parable of robots used and abused by humanity as they begin to reach their own sentience, wrapped its sense of justice up in Dolores, the sweet prairie girl waking from a nightmare, and Maeve, the bloodthirsty madam who breaks out of the matrix.
But there is one woman on whose shoulders all the world’s troubles hung this year: Catherine Cawood. Happy Valley’s long-suffering sergeant was implicated in a murder, helped to track down a serial killer as well as a bent and murderous detective, while also protecting her grandson from the spitting rage of his possessive rapist father, Tommy Lee Royce, and saving her sister from a relapse into addiction. And with British succinctness, she did it all in six episodes, and still had time to get drunk. To fix Britain’s messy political landscape, here’s what I propose: Cawood for PM, 2020. It’s the only way.
During the festive season the Portuguese capital overdoses on cakes, desserts, fried pastries etc, with people queuing to buy them in pastelarias (bakeries). My favourite are sonhos (dreams) – light, deep-fried doughnuts, sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon. They can be made with flour and eggs, or with flour and mashed boiled pumpkin. There are good ones at Pastelaria Versailles, a beautiful, art nouveau cafe dating back to 1922. Still, bolo rei (king cake) is probably the most popular treat and you’ll see it everywhere. The old cafe Confeitaria Nacional (near Rossio square) introduced this French cake to Lisbon in the 19th century, and now it’s baked all over the country. It’s dry, with soft dough, and is not too sweet, with nuts and candied fruits. Bolo-rainha is the same but without the candied fruits. Whoever finds the dry broad bean hidden inside has to buy the next bolo rei.

The scent of spicy, baked biscuits marks the start of the festive season in the Low Countries. Speculoos, a crunchy biscuit made with brown sugar and cinnamon, is eaten all year round and known worldwide through the miniature version served with cups of coffee. But the biscuit was originally associated with Saint Nicholas Day, celebrated in early December. Traditionally, children would leave their shoes by the chimney with carrots for Saint Nicholas’s horse and in the morning find biscuits in their place. Although the Flanders towns of Ghent and Bruges are strong on cookies, Brussels has claimed speculoos as its own. During December, Brussels bakers make one-foot-long speculoo Christmas trees, set in traditional wooden moulds. Best known of the cookie makers is Maison Dandoy on the aptly-named Rue au Beurre.

On the days leading up to Christmas a curious site can be seen (and smelled) on the streets of Prague. Throughout the city, fish farmers dressed in full garb sell live carp from huge water-filled tanks. With the original recipe attributed to Magdalena Dobromila Rettigova, called the mother of Czech cuisine, fried carp served with potato salad has been the traditional Christmas meal served in Czech households since at the least the 19th century. While some have the fish vendors butcher the carp on the spot, the more entertaining tradition is taking the carp home live and letting it swim around in the bathtub until it’s time to prepare the meal, served on Christmas Eve. To try this traditional dish head to Pilsen Restaurant in the Municipal House or Aureole (both offer special Christmas menus). And don’t forget to save a scale, dry it and put it in your wallet for the year as doing so is said to bring good fortune.
In sweet contrast, Vanocka is a delicious sweet bread that is traditionally served on the morning of Christmas Day. Similar to a braided brioche or Jewish Challa, this yummy yeast-based loaf, dating back to the 16th-century and taking its name from the Czech word for Christmas (Vanoce), includes raisons, almonds and lemon zest and in some recipes includes anise or nutmeg and is topped with powdered sugar. Two good spots to try Vanocka are Eska, a restaurant and bakery hybrid, and Antoninovo Pekarstvi, a neighbourhood bakery with two locations. Slice and top with butter or honey, or just enjoy this tasty Czech Christmas loaf plain.

Spending New Year’s Eve in Berlin will allow you to debunk one of the most enduring myths about the German capital via a culinary tradition: in June 1963, US president John F Kennedy made a fool of himself saying “Ich bin ein Berliner”, which in German means “I am a doughnut”. In fact, the proper German term for a doughnut with a jam filling is a Berliner pfannkuchen or “Berlin pancake”. In most parts of the country people refer to it as a Berliner – but in Berlin itself people call it a pfannkuchen. Even though most bakeries sell Berliner pancakes all year around, they are particularly associated with New Year’s Eve parties, and tradition demands that for every eight doughnuts filled with jam, you slip in one filled with mustard (senf) to play a trick on an unlucky guest. Enjoy, and cut JFK some slack.

The olivier salad, a dish rich in mayonnaise, simply can’t be avoided if you want to fully experience winter festivities Russian-style. Also known as Russian or Stolichniy salad, it’s democratic, hailing from Soviet times when fancy food was not easy to procure: it’s just potatoes, vegetables, ham, eggs and mayonnaise. Even the characters in the ultimate Russian new year film, the Irony of Fate romantic comedy, eat it. To get the most affordable version of the salad go to Teremok, a chain of Russian style fast food cafes, where olivier is served deconstructed for you to mix up yourself. Varnichnaya, a chain of dumpling cafes, offers a chicken olivier in all of its branches. Or, if you’re willing to splash out, go to Mari Vanna, where prices for ham olivier start at RUB470 (£6).

You can’t spend Christmas in Denmark without being served the nation’s favourite Christmas pudding, risalamande – a cold rice pudding with whipped cream and chopped almonds served with a hot cherry sauce. Originally rice pudding was the traditional Christmas dessert, but as the price of rice rose sharply during the second world war, the cream and almonds were added to make it last. Danes celebrate Christmas on the evening of 24 December when the pudding is served in a large bowl, and a whole almond is added. Whoever gets the almond gets the “almond present”. This has been known to cause great disputes as some people – mainly uncles and grandpas – hide the almond in their hand or in their cheek, thus leaving members of their family not only in great suspense, but with aching bellies from eating way too much of the rich and filling dessert. If you are not celebrating Christmas in a Danish home, you can get risalamande at many restaurants in Copenhagen. A local favourite is Schønnemann’s, in the city centre where you get some of the city’s best smørrebrød. Be sure to have the pickled herring and the schnapps too.

In the Romanian countryside the tradition is to slaughter a pig at Christmas, and while this practice is long gone in big cities such as Bucharest, pork dishes remain ubiquitous throughout the holiday period – along with copious amounts of țuică (fruit brandy). Sarmale (minced meat, rice and onions wrapped in cabbage leaves) is available year-round but has a prominent place on the Christmas table, while dishes such as piftie (pork and garlic in gelatine), șorici (salted pork rinds) and jumări (chunks of pork fat, fried) feature heavily. For those visiting Bucharest over Christmas and looking to try some of these meaty treats, traditional restaurants like Caru’ cu bere, a 19th-century beer hall in the heart of the city, Hanu’ lui Manuc, a centuries-old traders inn, and Curtea Berarilor have a full menu of classic Romanian dishes, with platters of the above featured prominently.

Every December large groups of people vie for spots at seasonal buffets called julbord (Christmas table). This is built up from base items – pickled herring, cured salmon and meatballs – regular staples in smörgåsbords. But as Christmas is the mother of all seasonal buffets, julbord draws on 19th-century Swedish soul food traditions with specific dishes, such as Jansson’s Temptation (potato-anchovy casserole), dopp i grytan (bread dipped in pork broth), lutfisk (gelatinous white fish dish), risgrynsgröt (rice porridge), and julskinka (Christmas ham); all washed down with a non-alcoholic sweet root beer-like beverage, julmust. Restaurants are often fully booked to celebrate this official end of the working season, but for an atmospheric julbord experience, hop aboard Strömma’s steamboats for SEK 595 (£51) as you sail around Stockholm’s archipelago.

The French Christmas meal - traditionally known as Le Reveillon – is celebrated on the evening of 24 December – and involves the politically incorrect, and banned in some countries, foie gras, as well as oysters, smoked salmon, turkey or capon and a chocolate cake known as a buche with, depending on the budget, champagne or sparkling wine. Much of this is actually quite new. Traditionally, Catholic families ate their Christmas meal on returning from midnight mass, which in those days started at midnight. Back then Christmas dishes depended on the region: oysters in the west, foie gras in Alsace and the south-west, pork in rural areas.
The Christmas buche or log cake is a tradition apart. It used to be that a log was put on the fire to keep it going through the evening until the family returned from mass. In recent times, with fewer chimneys, the log has been replaced by a chocolate cake desert, these days more often than not industrially produced and filled with ice-cream. A three-course Christmas menu with starters, including foie gras and/or snails and a glass of champagne costs €69 at Julien, part of the fabulously decorated art-nouveau chain that includes Bofinger, La Coupole, Flo and the Terminus Nord (by the Gare du Nord). It’s in the previously unfashionable, but increasingly trendy 10th arrondissement.

Shellfish, bream, lamb, and turkey may be festive staples in Spain but nothing says Christmas quite so cloyingly as the plethora of sugary treats that weigh down tables and stomachs at the end of December. Spanish nougat (turrón) can be hard or soft but its appeals seldom wanes. Similarly popular are polvorones (shortbread, the name of which hints at the dusty debris into which they crumble) and mantecados (like polvorones but enriched with lard). Among Madrid’s oldest and best known confectioners are Casa Mira, La Antigua Pastelería del Pozo and El Riojano, all of which have been serving the sweet-toothed of the city since the 19th century. Take an appetite and expectations of a serious sugar rush.

My family and I have lived on the edge of the Mudumalai wildlife sanctuary in the Nilgiri mountains, south India, for over three decades now. The children grew up here. Yet the thrill of knowing there’s an elephant in the garden is a feeling we all still savour. We cherish our elephant memories and can’t ever seem to become blasé about them.
Our elephant adventures began in 1984 when, with our one-year-old daughter, my husband and I crossed the jungle in a dilapidated jeep, sticking behind a lorry for comfort and company. The herds of elephants standing like sentinels on either side of the Bandipur-Mudumalai forest highway had us frantically praying for our safety. Mostly, one elephant, the matriarch, would trumpet loudly, warning us off, especially if there were young calves with the herd. Then she would angrily paw the ground as a prelude to charging. We would race away before she could carry out her threat.
It was wise to flee. We heard stories of tourists whose jeeps were overturned, while a couple of foolhardy photographers were killed because they ventured out of their cars and moved too close, dismissing the Adivasi guide’s pleas to stop immediately. Adivasis – India’s indigenous, aboriginal people – were originally hunter-gatherers who lived in the forests and knew them inside out. Many still do. Elephants are deceptive animals. They look docile and unthreatening, so tourists think it’s safe to picnic in the jungle. Yet angry elephants have knocked down interlopers in seconds before they could take off.
We locals have a love-hate relationship with wildlife. We take pride in our beautiful mountains and forests, and the excitement of visitors when there’s a porcupine outside the window or, even better, big cat noises at night. I go ballistic at the sound of sambar deer because one nocturnal banqueting visit will decimate my much-loved garden, so I adore the leopards that keep them away. Yet I loathe the panther that killed and devoured our beloved dog Elsa. All of us are acutely aware that we are privileged to live here. The animals’ presence brings something romantic, exotic and surreal into our lives.
A few days ago my conservationist son sent excited messages about a first-time visitor to our place, a wild elephant named Moopan. “Not much serious damage,” he texted. “He enjoyed your patch of anthuriums, though.” I smiled – what price a few fading anthuriums if Mr Moopan fancied them? The next morning, our toddler grand-daughter phoned excitedly to ask, “Has Mr Moopan come back to see us?”
Some months ago, another young pachyderm paid us a visit. Our dinner guests were forced to stay the night as an elephant on our narrow, winding road was not something the jeep could easily avoid. But all of us were enthralled. Our youngest son, a film-maker, was over the moon, photographing and filming the elephant outside his bedroom window. The jumbo was so close, we could have touched him if we’d dared to reach out. Perhaps he sensed he had us in thrall because he chomped his way calmly through the clump of bamboo, unperturbed by our presence, before lumbering off early in the morning.
We got off lightly. Just a few weeks ago, a local house was badly damaged after an elephant calf apparently ventured inside to explore, followed by the protective mother. After inadvertently knocking down several walls, the elephants found the store of rice and other grains, smashing up the kitchen as they devoured it. Ambika, the owner of the house, was philosophical about it, resigned to the realities of living with elephants. She hopes to get some compensation from the government, and mentioned that she needed to be more careful about leaving her home unoccupied.
Less dramatically, in the Adivasi village of Chembakolly, an elephant sheltering from the monsoon rains once got bored and began nibbling at the school’s thatched roof. The rain didn’t stop, so Ms Jumbo kept munching. By the time the clouds moved on, she had eaten half of it, giving the children an unplanned holiday.
Adivasis regard wildlife very differently from other, more urbanised people. They believe, quite simply, that the animals have as much right to food as human forest-dwellers. One elephant took to coming towards the local Adivasi hospital every evening. With minimal fuss, the tribal staff adjusted their schedules to suit the animal. One lad cut down most of his sugarcane crop and strewed it along the path leading away to the jungle. My son asked him why. “The poor fellow wouldn’t come here unless he was really hungry,” went the very logical reply. “If I put the cane down for him he’ll eat it and go back to the forest. That way no one will be hurt.”
Sitting on a verandah, you’ll hear some lovely wildlife stories. Tall tales? They sound like it, but who knows?
“That naughty fellow,” one forest-dwelling Adivasi begins, “stands outside my hut. I stepped out in the middle of the night, needed to pee, walked straight into him. ‘Move,’ I said, giving him a whack. Thought he was a cow. Next morning I saw the elephant dung outside my house. Gave me a fright, I can tell you, to think I smacked an elephant.”
Someone laughs. “Quite a few drinks you must have had to mistake an elephant for a cow?”
“It was a pitch-dark night. I was half-asleep,” protests the raconteur.
Such delightful stories could fill a book. But there’s another side of the coin. It’s really not that much fun to bump into an elephant in the dark. Far too many people have not lived to tell the tale.
Death by elephant is gruesome, grisly, sordid and terrible. Unsuspecting people who stumble across an enraged elephant stand no chance whatsoever. Kokila, an Adivasi woman we knew, went out to collect firewood and was just a few feet from her home when an elephant picked her up, flung her to the ground and pulverised her. No one knows why. Forest officials had the horrible task of picking up the pieces, and returning her trampled remains to her relatives in a bag. That vivacious, laughing woman, who loved to dance and sing, had been smashed to smithereens in minutes.
So elephants on the doorstep make life unpredictable and dangerous for the vulnerable. It’s difficult for armchair environmentalists to even begin to grasp this reality. It’s all very well to pontificate, as I’ve heard city folks do, that “we humans are encroaching on their forests.” But what’s the solution?
When a poor farmer borrows heavily to plant a crop, he’ll do anything to protect it. His life depends on it. Marauding elephants raiding an about-to-be harvested paddy field cannot expect to be welcomed like special guests. The battle between beast and farmer is ugly. We’ve heard of people flinging flaming tyres on to raider elephants. Apparently the burning rubber sticking to their backs is a sure-fire way of driving them away. I shudder at the thought – but it happens regularly.
In 1987, an elephant died in a nearby paddy field. It had more than 40 festering bullet wounds all over its body. Poachers possibly – but also farmers taking desperate potshots to protect their crops.
Experts are working on solutions to human-elephant conflicts. Some are doomed to failure, like the schemes to dig trenches or build electric fences around human settlements. Elephants rapidly suss them out and clamber in, around and over them. My son is working on a local early warning system to warn people via text messages when there’s an elephant nearby. Apparently being alert to an elephant in the vicinity is paramount in avoiding tragedy.
There are more questions than answers, for sure. But as my husband put it, “More people die in car accidents every single day, in every city on the globe. But they won’t take cars off the roads, will they?” So we need to strive for practical ways of preventing elephant accidents. And, romanticised though it seems, look to traditional forest dwellers to understand the animals better.
A recipe for a very merry Christmas drink for 17th century monks, beginning with ten pints of brandy, has been rediscovered by a Durham university academic, in the archives of Ampleforth Abbey in north Yorkshire.
The recipes – there were two similar versions, one for a punch, one for a drink known as “shrub” – were written down for English Benedictine monks who were in exile in France after the dissolution of the monasteries. Both were flavoured with orange and lemon peel, with added sugar and water, and involved days of steeping and mixing the ingredients.
Although monastic communities commonly drank alcohol because the quality of drinking water was so unreliable, these recipes were clearly not an everyday tipple. Dr James Kelly, from the department of theology and religion at Durham University, said the volume of the ingredients and the care that went into them were significant.
“The quantity, and the time taken to make the drink, suggests that this was something to be enjoyed on special occasions by the whole monastic community – not a quick drink for cocktail hour.”
He discovered the recipes as part of his Monks in Motion project, which looked into the travels and influence of the English Benedictine Monks after they were forced into exile.
Ampleforth was founded when the monks had to move again after the French Revolution, and returned to England as the anti-Catholic laws were gradually relaxed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. As the archives prove, they brought their favourite recipes back with them.
The name of the monastic order is still associated with the sweet herbal liqueur Benedictine, which was claimed to have been created by them at the great abbey in Fécamp in France –. But it was in fact a brilliant marketing wheeze by the 19th century entrepreneur who invented it.
Move over prawn cocktails and vol-au-vents. Sales of upmarket readymade Christmas canapes are booming as hosts stock up with delights such as miniature prawn doughnuts and salmon carpaccio.
With tills ringing as Christmas food shopping gets under way, this week will be the busiest in the UK for sales of party food and snacks over the festive season, according to supermarkets. This year, unusual and eye-catching modern “sweet made savoury” treats inspired by luxury delicacies from top Parisian stores and patisseries such as Fauchon have emerged as a striking trend in some supermarket aisles.
New from Marks & Spencer, for example – which has launched a record 260 new food and drink products for this year’s festive season – are seafood knickerbocker glories, hot and sour prawn doughnuts and smoked salmon carpaccio, while among Waitrose’s nibbles with a savoury twist are salmon and crab profiteroles and mini beef and chicken pies that resemble mince pies. With Christmas Day breakfast of growing importance, breakfast canapes are expected to be popular.
“It’s clear customers are getting more and more sophisticated in their taste and are really looking for something out of the ordinary,” said Sandra Ziles, head of product development at M&S.
“Food has become the most important part of Christmas and customers want to wow their guests. It’s interesting to see how traditions have changed – 1970s favourites prawn cocktail and vol-au-vents are now losing out to fresher, cleaner flavours with a twist.”
M&S expects to sell a staggering 140m pieces of party food over the festive season, washed down by 10m glasses of Prosecco.
A key source of inspiration for Ziles and her team is Paris – which they typically visit at least a year ahead of Christmas to scour the shelves and aisles of top groceries, tasting the products as they go along. The smoked salmon carpaccio in its new range, for example, was inspired last year by a similar product in the department store Le Bon Marché’s Grande Épicerie – a recently reopened food hall famous for its desserts and patisserie as well as gourmet savoury products. The retailer was similarly inspired by sweet products for the smoked salmon mousse-filled, gilded baubles that adorn its seafood starters and terrine.
The Co-op – the UK’s largest convenience retailer with 2,800 outlets – predicts revellers will snap up a record 56m canapes and 26m glasses of Prosecco. It is expecting to see sales of buffet favourites soar – including 22m cocktail sausage rolls and 4.4m mini-bites. Sales of chilled party foods are up 4% on the same time last year, according to a spokesperson, who added: “Co-op is the country’s leading community food retailer and our stores are open over the festive period to meet customer needs. We are expecting a busy Christmas Eve and our stores have been manned efficiently to ensure customers receive the best service.”
Now on sale at Waitrose is its large version of arguably the most eye-catching dessert to grace the Christmas table – a bacon and banana-flavoured trifle devised by Heston Blumenthal – which, dusted with gold “nibs”, is among the many puddings this year with the bling factor.
Fresh and pre-ordered turkeys go into most stores on Monday. The big supermarkets are expecting Christmas food shopping to start in earnest mid-week and peak on so-called festive Friday, which will be the busiest trading day of the whole year. Shoppers are likely to leave buying festive fresh vegetables as late as possible to ensure tip-top condition, but the latest supermarket price war means they can snap up potatoes, carrots and sprouts for as little as 19p from German discounter Aldi, 20p from Asda and 29p from Lidl.
Last year’s trend of “posh crisps” – featuring flavours such as gin and tonic and even pulled pork – has gone from strength to strength. The Co-op has already raised eyebrows with its Christmas Dinner crisps, described as “a delicious mix of turkey and stuffing, carrot, maple parsnip, and everyone’s favourite... sprout crisps”.

Australia is not a country of many Christmas traditions. Prawns on the day can be pretty usual, families who insist on a hot lunch on a 30-degree day are still common enough while the rest of the country is enjoying cold ham, and Santas are still expected to dress in the full red suit.
But thanks to Australia’s extreme distances (my in-laws live the distance from Budapest to London away from my parents) and fewer jobs that shut down at Christmas, a quasi-tradition is orphan’s Christmas. Not permanent, but seasonal: Christmas away from family with friends or acquaintances or nobody.
My first Christmas away was when I was living three hours from home but had to work on the day, so after work I sat in my apartment complex’s pool and watched a holidaying family splash around and smile at me pityingly.
I was 18 and felt incredibly grown up in that cute way a teenager can find something as mundane as grocery shopping for themselves thrilling. Not only had I worked Christmas Day, I was alone. Two years later I was working again and my flatmates, all from Adelaide, could not afford the trip from Queensland for the holidays. It was my first proper orphan’s Christmas.
We had an ordinary barbecue and drank too much with nobody to tell us not to. Driving to the orphan’s Christmas from work I was pulled over by police who noticed the expired registration sticker on my car but in the spirit of Christmas decided to let me go without running the car through the system. (I recently told two Aboriginal men this story and they looked at each other before bursting into laughter: “That actually happens to white people?!”)
Since then I have spent Christmas in Ireland; at the beach with my boss; and once in my hometown being threatened by my mother that she will tell our dad about our bad behaviour in mass.
An orphan’s Christmas isn’t always the answer to a family-less Christmas. Psychologist and health centre director Suzanne Leckie, from Sane Australia, says loneliness is common at Christmas and it has been a hot topic for months on the organisation’s forums.
“There’s an enormous amount of loneliness,” she said. “People are alone because they literally don’t have friends or family, but sometimes people are lonely because they are forced into company with family and friends where they don’t feel accepted.
“We recently had a forum about whether to ignore Christmas. For some people that’s a better choice. Rather than thinking people are nestled with family having a lovely time, just treat it as a day with better food, or a day where you just treat yourself. We’ve been calling it ‘reclaim Christmas’.”
Leckie suggests people could take advantage of the empty streets and enjoy places that are usually packed.
Naturally there’s an app called Orphan Christmas, an Australian not-for-profit that allows people to invite others who don’t have friends or family close by to come over for Christmas.
Several bars and restaurants are advertising orphans’ Christmas specials, although not often on the big day. On Facebook In London a Muslim-owned restaurant has invited the homeless and the elderly to dine for free on Christmas Day.
Being away from home for Christmas is a discombobulating thing.
After 18 years of doing the same thing every Christmas – being surrounded by more than 30 aunts, uncles and cousins – there is suddenly just you waking up in a house with a tree branch hastily decorated with twinkling lights. The roads are empty, and people biting into luscious meals cheerily greet you as you pass their house while you have butter on toast for a late breakfast.
Then there is the strange intimacy with the ragtag group of people you end up sharing this exalted day with. Usually an orphan’s Christmas is an eclectic smattering of colleagues, friends and acquaintances’ cousins. Can this really be Christmas? Everything feels wrong. There’s no grandfather handing out the presents. And sometimes there are no presents.
Christmas away from home throws off the final shackles of your childhood. You find yourself among other adults, and everything has changed. You realise you can go weeks without hearing either of your parents’ voices, you choose what to eat at every meal, and nobody cares if you wear a hat or sunscreen when you’re outside.
All these impossibly grown-up things you had imagined for so long, and now you are alone at Christmas and you realise: I’m an adult.
I much prefer going home for Christmas.
What’s your experience of being apart from your family at Christmas? Tell us in comments below.
Facebook, as everyone knows, is the devil. And Facebook in December is the devil’s armpit. We are approximately one week from the absolute nadir of it all, when the whole platform will collapse in on itself in a dismal, needy flurry of jet-propelled Aren’t-I-Lucky consumerist gift-haul photos. But by then at least we’ll all be hardened towards it, because by then we’ll have suffered through an entire month of Elf on the Shelf.
Now, I know that the Guardian doesn’t have a particularly festive reputation, and I realise that what I’m about to say isn’t exactly going to help this reputation. But hear me out: all I want for Christmas is to stamp on Elf on the Shelf’s throat until it coughs up blood and dies.
I know this is going to sound like hyperbole, given everything that has happened this year, but Elf on the Shelf is easily the most violently dreadful thing to happen in 2016. How I long for the happier days of 2015, when nobody knew what an Elf on the Shelf was, back before it spawned and multiplied like the Zika virus and threatened to monopolise every home in the country. What I’d give to go back in time, Inception myself inside the mind of the Elf on the Shelf creator and scream the word “bastards” at them so loudly that they forgot to ever invent the bloody thing.
There is a chance – a minuscule chance, admittedly – that you don’t know what an Elf on the Shelf is. If that’s the case, allow me to fill you in. An Elf on the Shelf is a small, posable toy elf that costs £31.95 and ostensibly acts as a scout for Father Christmas.
You put the elf on a shelf in early December and inform your children that he will always be watching and judging them for signs of bad behaviour. Then, just as your children learn to fear this nightmarish, murderer-looking totalitarian snitch, you start to move it around at night. Your children will wake up, look at the empty shelf, wonder where the elf has gone, and then find him, say, next to the toothbrushes in the bathroom. “Wow, this elf really enjoys scrutinising your entire life for traces of unacceptable behaviour,” you tell your child, who has now subconsciously made the decision to grow up under a pseudonym in an off-grid hut with tape covering their laptop’s webcam, just to escape the relentless corrosive judgment of the Elf on the Shelf.
Although Elf on the Shelf feels like it has gained ubiquity overnight, in reality it has enjoyed a sinister slow burn. It began 12 years ago as a self-published picture book in the US, and has gradually snowballed to the point that transatlantic success felt painfully inevitable. There were murmurings about Elf on the Shelf in Britain last year, but this is the year when it has really taken hold. Type “Elf” into Google and one of the first autocomplete suggestions is “on the Shelf”. The Elf on the Shelf Twitter account has 138,000 followers. According to Google News, almost 20 new articles about Elf on the Shelf are being published every single day. If you’ve got Instagram and a follow a certain type of person, you will see just how unstoppable this mangy little intruder has become.
The thing that most rankles about all this is just how aggressively Elf on the Shelf wants to become a timeless Christmas tradition. Every Elf on the Shelf comes emblazoned with the phrase “A Christmas Tradition”, which is immediately undone by the slightly needier “Adopt a New Family Tradition This Holiday Season” right underneath it. So it’s not really a tradition at all, but it figures that it can be if it tells you often enough. It’s the festive equivalent of Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again hat, determined to string you along until it’s too late. It’s a post-truth doll for a post-truth age.
And this hurts, because Christmas traditions are hard-won things. For example, my wife and I come from vastly different backgrounds, and Christmas Day is essentially a battle between the pair of us to see who gets to relive their childhood most vividly. Her dream Christmas is ornate and frilly, involving long walks in the country and carefully staggered presents that, for some reason, must definitely include a walnut in a shoe. Mine basically just involves me walking downstairs with a hangover, tearing open all my presents in 30 seconds flat like some ridiculous fat Godzilla, and then lying on the sofa with a tummy ache for the rest of the day. Both days are equally valid, because they have both been carefully forged over decades. And whatever ungainly walnuts-and-tummy-ache compromise we will end up reaching as a married couple will be just as valid, because we will have made it ourselves.
But buying into a sinister, scowling, Santa-hatted Chucky doll whose sole purpose is to intimidate children into meekness, simply because it has the word “tradition” printed across its front, isn’t valid at all. It’s terrifying and cynical, it sends a bizarre message to children and it couldn’t be any less Christmassy if it was a bucket of vomit that sing-cries The Greatest Love of All whenever it senses that someone is near. Honestly, you may as well wrap tinsel around a CCTV camera and pass that off as a fun new festive activity.
In summary, I would rather die than live under the harrowing surveillance-state gaze of Elf on the Shelf. Have a lovely Christmas, everyone.
Working out how much someone loves you at Christmas used to be so simple. Was the present expensive? Or did the giver sweat blood to make it?
No more. If, come 25 December, your gift doesn’t arrive branded with your initials, name or grinning face, or with a meaningful haiku, you can forget it – that relationship is as good as dead.
Pork pie with your name on it? Selfie slapped on a bottle of Moët & Chandon? The title of that tortuous first novel you still plan on finishing seared on to one of those Penguin mugs? All these, and more, could be yours.
“The thoughtfulness can show the gift has come from the heart,” says Vita Woods, creative manager at Selfridges, which is wall to wall with concessions offering to customise your goodies. John Lewis is also in on the act, as is Liberty, Debenhams and House of Fraser. Woods thinks personalising presents makes them “special to the individual and for the giver”. After all, nothing says “you’re the one” like a jar of bespoke Nutella that costs double the price of a normal one.
Some items have been personalised for ever. Think of pocket squares, shirt cuffs or pyjamas. It’s a lucrative business. A Louis Vuitton Speedy 30 bag, for example, costs £295 more with a monogram than without. But, thanks to technology and cheap bespoke labels, personalisation has gone mainstream – and it is proving a nice little earner for the shops and brands able to offer it. Vicki Loomes, who studies fads for the agency TrendWatching, thinks “consumers’ experiences on apps that learn purchasing behaviour are driving expectations around personalisation”. She adds: “Manufacturing technologies that allow ever-shorter production times and made-to-order products are allowing the physical world to catch up.”
So, who is to blame for the trend metastasising? Coca-Cola, perhaps, for those Share a Coke bottles in 2013, which reversed falling sales? Or Apple, which offered to personalise iPods (remember those?) in 2007? But the phenomenon goes back further. At the luxury end, accesories designer Anya Hindmarch has let customers add messages to her handbags ever since she started, nearly 30 years ago. She employs a “bespoke craftsman” at each of her flagship stores, in London, Tokyo, New York and Los Angeles.
“I have always loved the Oscar Wilde quote: ‘Be yourself, the other places are taken.’ Our bespoke offering embodies this. You can emboss any handwriting, drawings or naughty messages into the leather to create the product you want. It is the very opposite of seasonal fashion and logos,” says Hindmarch.
If you can’t face the queues for the special in-store services, or miss the cut-off dates to order something online, you could always get hold of an electric engraving pen for as little as a quid and get to work yourself. Possibly the ultimate in personalisation.
This year was largely focused on vandalising your clothes: razoring your jean hems, cropping your tops and, apparently, de-sleeving your shirts. To do this one, you need scissors and good arms. We’re fairly confident this question was made up.
A bleak perennial on the search engine’s annual fashion question roundup but, anyway ... To start, you need remarkable genes. If the year’s catwalk was anything to go by, you also needed curly hair and a decent handle on Instagram.
Thought £2,000 for a dress was expensive? Think again! Haute couture is like catwalk fashion except way, way more expensive, made to order as opposed to ready to wear and as close as fashion gets to art.
In fashion parlance, with a sliver of ankle flesh showing. In normal parlance, just shove them on, mate.
Before Labor Day, but also when you don’t have or want a baby, no longer take public transport, give up coffee and are the Flotus – present or elect.
Sign up to Instagram. Get a handle like “StrongIsSexxxxi41”. Remember that the straw of your green juice is a conduit to an alternative reality where your Lycra sports bra is never three sizes too small and that all burgers are props not sustenance.
Essentially: dressing up like Florence Welch’s cat-lady aunt after a day spent foraging for oyster mushrooms.
Lots of layers. So many layers that people questioned the eyesight, taste and sanity of a generation (see: the entire wardrobe of the Spice Girls).
Repeat (7) but with less awkwardly perched hats and a more laissez-faire attitude to personal hygiene.
The best thing a burgeoning designer can do is put down the mood board, appear on I’m Dancing on Ice in the Big Brother Bake-Off and “drop” a sex tape. Celebrity is the new St Martins (see: the Olsen twins, Kanye West and Beyoncé).
In 2005, Atlanta-based voiceover artist Susan Bennett recorded hundreds of hours of audio for a text-to-speech company. Six years later, on 4 October 2011, she quickly learned that those recordings had been licensed by Apple for the iPhone 4S’s built-in personal assistant, Siri. Overnight, Susan’s voice became globally recognised, whether she liked it or not.
In this week’s episode of Chips with Everything, Matt Shore speaks to Susan about her experiences of being thrust into the world of Siri and how her life has changed since that fateful day.

Age! Oh, you know, between about 18 and 25.
I said, APPEARANCE! Oh, right. Sorry, it’s a bit loud in here. Well, it depends on the bar. Most bar staff dress in an internationally popular style called “cooler than you are”.
Yeah, I’ve always thought that’s odd. I mean, I’m splashing my cash on a night out, they’re earning minimum wage in a low-skilled job, yet I’m the one who feels uncool. Well, fear not. Your days of relative uncoolness may be numbered, my friend.
Have I won a trendy makeover? People often say I would look better if my entire body was obscured by hair and tattoos. I’m sure you would, but no. You’re finally going to feel cooler than some bar staff because some of them are going to be machines.
Eh? The “world’s first” self-service beer pump with contactless card payments began trials this week at Henry’s Cafe & Bar in Piccadilly, central London. It has been designed as an attention-seeking gimmick by Barclaycard, which says it might launch it at festivals and other places where there are often long queues at the bar.
So now we’re letting computers control our beer? That’s right.
Actually, that’s probably quite wise. How does this thing work? Well, you select a drink on the screen, pay with your card, then place your glass under the spout and watch it fill with ale.
What if I don’t want ale? Tough. Lager is too fizzy to dispense reliably. Everything else is complicated in other ways. You get ale.
Will it refuse to serve me if I’m already drunk, as required by law? Oh, um, yeah. I’m sure Barclaycard has installed a pop-up breathalyser or something.
OK. And how does the machine know I’m older than 18? Apart from my dress sense, I mean. Dunno. You have to be 18 to have some bank cards. Or maybe a bored human has to stand next to the pump watching people use it, like at the supermarket.
And will they be cooler than I am? Almost certainly.
Do say: “I have read this ale’s terms and conditions. Cancel/Agree.”
I have never really thought of myself as the sort of cook who makes his own bits and pieces to serve with drinks. Too much fiddle and faff if you ask me. But then when I do, I realise I should have done so all along. Not just because what I’ve made often tastes better than anything I can buy, but because the effort is much more appreciated. Thoughtful drinks and homemade bits like the gin lemonade and bacon popcorn below aren’t a great deal of trouble and say Merry Christmas far more effectively than arranging something you’ve just picked up from the shops on a plate.
With these drinks may I wish you all a happy and peaceful Christmas. See you in a couple of weeks.
Bright as the star in the east, a fresh, citrus-scented gin cocktail.
Makes enough for 4-6 small glasses
unwaxed lemons 2
caster sugar 5 tbsp
still mineral water 500ml
juniper berries 8
ice cubes 
gin (50ml to 250ml of lemonade)
Cut the lemons into large pieces, pips and all peel, and place in a blender jug then add the sugar and water. Process to a thick creamy-yellow liquor, then tip into a jug. Crack the juniper berries lightly using a heavy weight or pestle and mortar. Add to the lemon syrup then refrigerate.
Put ice into the glasses. Pour over the gin and top up with lemonade, and garnish with a slice of lemon.
Bacon fat works brilliantly with the fennel, lending a scent of porcetta.
Lay the bacon or pancetta on a baking sheet and cook under a hot grill until crisp. Turn and cook the other side. You are after truly crisp flesh. Lift the rashers from the tray and place on kitchen paper. Reserve the fat in the tray, tipping it into a deep saucepan.
Melt 95g of the butter in a small pan. While it melts, bash the fennel seed using a pestle and mortar, to release its fragrance, not to crush to a powder, then add to the butter and stir, letting it warm gently. Turn off the heat.
Melt the remaining butter in the bacon fat over a moderate heat, then add the popping corn. Cover tightly with a lid, shaking the pan occasionally, until the kernels have popped. This will take anything between 3 and 5 minutes, depending on the heat and thickness of your pan.
Crumble the bacon or pancetta into tiny pieces, add to the fennel-seed butter with a little sea salt then fold into the popcorn and serve.
Deep ruby red, nicely balanced between sweet and sour, this is a perfect drink for Christmas morning.
Peel the clementines, and break into segments. Remove the skin and pith with your fingers, then lay the segments on a tray and place in the freezer for a couple of hours.
Crack the cardamom pods open with a heavy weight, such as a mortar, but don’t grind them to a powder.
Divide the pomegranate juice between glasses, add two segments of frozen clementines to each glass, then a cardamom pod. Top up with prosecco and serve with ice.
About the size of Danish pastries, these are best warm from the oven.
Makes about 12
green olives 200g (stoned weight 150g)
garlic 2 cloves
basil 10g
parsley leaves 5g
olive oil 120ml
parmesan 60g, grated
puff pastry 500g, ready made
egg a little beaten to glaze
If the olives have stones, remove them. Then put the olive flesh into the bowl of a food processor. Peel the garlic and add the cloves to the olives. Put the basil, leaves and stalks and the parsley leaves into the bowl of the food processor, then process, pouring in the olive oil as you go until you have a loose green paste. Stir in most of the grated parmesan, leaving a little to scatter over the finished pastries.
On a floured work surface, roll out the pastry to a rectangle of about 44 x 30cm. Spread the olive paste over the surface of the pastry leaving a 2cm rim of bare pastry on all sides. Brush the rim with egg wash.
With the narrow edge towards you, roll the pastry up into a long thick sausage, pressing the edges tightly together to seal. Wrap the roll lightly in kitchen paper and refrigerate for 30 minutes. It will firm up a little, making it easier to slice.
Line a baking sheet with baking parchment. Cut the roll into finger- thick slices, placing them flat on the parchment. You will have about 12. Scatter a little of the remaining parmesan over the surface of each and bake for 12-15 minutes or until crisp, golden and puffed.
Using a palette knife, remove the cooked pastries from the baking tray and serve warm.

Bowie was the first music I really connected with. I’m 19, so wasn’t around when he arrived, but he always felt modern to me – the way he challenged definitions, his confidence, the way he was a figure of self-acceptance for people who don’t feel represented, as well as playing a character.
After my mum texted to tell me that he had died, I got into the shower and cried. I suppose I was crying because it meant I would never get a chance to tell Bowie how important he’d been to us.
Later I saw the reaction unfolding on Twitter, and it became clear that everyone was desperate to talk, to be together, to share his music. So I made a Facebook event, a street party in Brixton, near the mural of his portrait.
In the first hour there were more than 500 responses – eventually that grew to 9,000. I didn’t organise anything really. I just located a space.
At 6pm there were only a couple of us with a guitar and loads of TV cameras. Then the crowds formed. Someone projected the Life on Mars video from their flat on to the wall. There were a lot of tears, but it was much happier than I thought it would be. At one point there were a thousand of us singing “Starman” at the top of our voices.
Gender politics had always been a part of my life, but it was this that made me get involved with the Women’s Equality party and meet people like the Labour MP Stella Creasy, who invited me for a drink at the House of Commons.
I suppose what she saw in me was someone who was staying true to their self, which seems to be the main thrust of what sparked people’s imaginations. I went into a bit of a bunker after it all blew up. I didn’t read any of the press about my awards, or follow it on social media, and to be honest, I’ve forgotten quite a lot about the whole thing, mainly because I’ve been working nonstop, first on a space film called Life, then on The Nutcracker, which of course have been totally different from Mad Max.
If Nutcracker is nominated next year, I won’t wear a fancy gown. I’d look like Widow Twanky. Just like with Mad Max, I’d be paying homage to the film, so possibly there’d be some glitter involved.
I’m still shocked at what an impact it had. I wore trousers – it ended up meaning so much more. I’m interested to see what everybody else wears this year. If it proved one thing, it’s the power of clothes.
Go is seen as an artform in Asia and people have played it for thousands of years: they consider that it embodies the mysteries of the universe in some way. So we knew the DeepMind Go match was going to be quite a big event in South Korea, but we didn’t realise the whole country would come to a standstill watching it.
We’d spent two years developing the AlphaGo artificial intelligence programme. Go is so complex – with more possible positions than atoms in the universe – that you need something akin to human intuition to win. The challenge was to mimic aspects of human intuition, like subconscious pattern matching.
We knew AlphaGo had advantages and disadvantages. It can’t read Go books or learn from other people – it has to build its own knowledge.
So before the match with grandmaster Lee Sedol, we didn’t know how well it was going to do. AlphaGo had played against itself a million times, but we weren’t sure if it would be weak against a human player who could be more creative.
The evening before the match they were predicting a 5-0 loss: the consensus until then was that it would take another 10-20 years to develop a programme to beat a world champion. But it was how AlphaGo won that was amazing, with astounding moves that were so creative. Since that game, the top players all want to play against it. Sedol told me afterwards it was the most amazing experience of his life.
When I saw that big English boy coming towards us with his mobile, happily shouting: “I’ve got a picture with the hijacker!” I couldn’t resist saying: “You are an idiot, man.” I wish I’d slapped him. What if he really had a bomb? I fly often, but I’m not relaxed any more. Now I constantly look around. For the first two months I didn’t manage to get back to work.
The hijacker was the man sitting in the aircraft tail, on the hostess seat, appearing and disappearing behind the curtains. In Cyprus, he released everyone apart from the staff and us, the five westerners. It scared me so badly. “Here we go,” I thought. We were gathered in the tail. I thought: I hope the commander managed to empty the fuel tanks, the hijacker might have explosives on him.
Then I thought, if I lower myself in the seat, it will help take the worst of the explosion. Meanwhile the English boy, Benjamin, goes to the bathroom and returns with that picture. I was so angry. As well as thinking it was absurd. I heard him saying on television that he got the picture to ascertain whether the belt was really explosive. Which is plainly not true. He smiled like a kid.
I was not laughing. I was on the phone with my wife, telling her, “If anything happens to me, give my bike to a friend and ask him to scatter my ashes at full speed.”
Leicester got rid of manager Nigel Pearson and put Claudio Ranieri in charge and that made me think they could do really well. They had a manager with so much experience, anything could happen.
The odds against winning the premier league were 5,000/1, which was very appealing. And stranger things have happened. I was camping in the middle of a field in Cornwall with my fiancée and I downloaded the William Hill app and put £1 on. It helped that I’d had a few drinks. Then I thought, if this actually happens I’ll be fuming at the end of the season – so I put £5 on them to win before they’d even kicked a ball.
It was just banter all the way up to Christmas and then it started to sink in. I’m really not a nervous person, but towards the end of the season it was quite unbearable. It took over my life. What had been a laugh and a joke got more tense with each game.
Just before the end of the season, they played Manchester United. I was on a stag weekend in Tallinn. I was actually sick that day through nerves – that’s how bad it got. I came back and Chelsea beat Spurs and that was it, Leicester had won.
It was the weirdest feeling. It started off as a nice experience, but it got to a stage where it was just too much for me. You just can’t handle the number of phone calls you get. Stuff like that doesn’t happen to me. There were thousands of reports online, and pictures off my Facebook. I sort of embraced it. I thought, nothing like this is ever going to happen again. I didn’t do myself any favours.
About a month before, it had all got too much, and I cashed out £2 of the £5 pound bet so in total I got about £20,000 instead of £25,000.
I didn’t meet any of the players or anything like that. I was a bit annoyed that the club didn’t contact me. I was hoping that they might do. But I suppose you can’t have it all. At the celebrations, I did keep thinking, when people who didn’t even know me congratulated me, this isn’t my day, this is Leicester’s day.
In a depressing year of politics defined by fear and division, the election of Sadiq Khan as Mayor of London was a rare moment of joy. I first met Sadiq when we were both starting out as young lawyers. Everyone could see he was a precocious legal talent. But what really made him stand out was his unshakeable confidence, not just about his own skills, but about what he could do for his clients.
At a time when people like us – a British Asian and a mixed-race guy, from comprehensive schools – were uncommon in the legal profession, he refused to see himself as an outsider: if we showed we had the ability, then we belonged. It was inspiring.
That same inspiring confidence and sense of belonging was on display this year. Siren voices asked throughout the campaign whether Londoners were ready to elect a British-born, Pakistani-origin mayor of Islamic faith. Londoners answered with a resounding “yes” in May.
I am honoured to be working with Sadiq again, now as his deputy mayor for social integration and social mobility. I have the chance to help him give others the same opportunities he had, and to ensure Londoners live truly interconnected lives. It has also allowed me to see up close the excitement and energy surrounding his new mayoralty. From surprised commuters sneaking a selfie when they see him on the Northern Line, to business and civic leaders in Paris and Chicago keen to forge new links with London, everyone is enthusiastic about a mayor who so aptly represents the confidence and aspirations of a modern, diverse city. Bill Clinton summed it up when he turned to Sadiq during a discussion in New York and said, “I cheered when I saw you had been elected. We all did.”
London is proud that it voted for Sadiq Khan. And the world is proud of London for doing so.
The Vote Leave bus provided the focus for visits. As to the £350m, it was accurate – that’s what we’ve lost control over. I hadn’t known Boris before I worked with him on the bus. We’d have this daily meeting and he’d ask, “Are we still on the right track?” I liked that. The greatest criticism I got from Labour party members was not the side I’d taken (they knew my views), it was the fact that I was working with Boris.
The outside world assumes we are all hard-skinned creatures. I think Boris found it difficult. At times it got to him, like it got to all of us. You go out and people shout at you things like “traitor”. It is difficult.
What surprises me most now is that the Remain side have not taken ownership of the fact that they have lost. They are still talking about it as if something has gone wrong with the electorate. We are back on an almost daily basis to refighting the referendum.
My family is from Bavaria so they understand more the view of people in the UK who are critical of the EU. There were emails during the campaign in which German people made out that I was a traitor to the German post-world war project. But it has settled since the result. I was at a meeting recently where I explained to people in Germany why the British people voted as they did and they listened and understood. There was a real sadness though.
Winning the Palme d’Or for I, Daniel Blake was extraordinary. It was an endorsement and meant distributors were given confidence to show the film, so a lot of people saw it and it couldn’t be ignored. It’s rattled a few cages, which is what we hoped for.
Across Europe there are people in comparable situations. When we were researching the script we found people who were feeding their kids biscuits because they had no money. There’s a level of poverty that’s just not talked about. I think that’s something fiction can do that a straight news report can’t. It takes you into people’s inner lives.
If the film is to be anything other than a news story that fades, it’s got to translate into political action. The demand for food banks has gone through the roof. A lot of people become homeless. At every screening people put up their hands and say: “It happened to me.” We heard story after story: when Iain Duncan Smith and others say the film isn’t accurate, they’re lying. We know it is accurate.
As the CEO of Women’s Aid, I’ve met women from all walks of life who have been through domestic abuse. Amber Heard’s allegations about Johnny Depp were all too appallingly familiar. What was disappointing was how immediate the backlash was. People were quick to wade in and blame her and accuse her of lying. [Depp denied all the allegations and the case was settled out of court.] When a women makes an allegation of domestic abuse, people tend to pick around for ulterior motives.
We saw an increase in women coming forward after The Archers’ abuse storyline, and when Amber went public the numbers of calls to police skyrocketed.
Domestic abuse charities are underfunded and we don’t tend to be the sort of charity that celebrities like to attach themselves to so, in a sense, Amber’s public statement was extremely powerful.

Being in Downing Street on the night of 23 June felt like walking across a path to safety, only to suddenly drop into quicksand. No one was going to pull us out.
As I arrived in No 10 that evening, still wearing a “Stronger In” T-shirt, everyone was nervous, despite people queuing up to say we’d won. The markets were buoyant, pollsters were confident and even Nigel Farage was conceding defeat.
The early results put the lie to that. Come 4am it was clearly over. Slumped in his office chair, the prime minister dismissed arguments he should stay on. “It would be miserable. I’d be being prepared for the slaughterhouse. Just waiting for the tap on the shoulder.” I watched him disappear along the corridor to spend time with his family.
When he came downstairs a few hours later, David Cameron said: “Well, that didn’t go to plan!” Of course he cared deeply – he was simply trying to lead people through his and their pain in a very English way.
After a concession call to Michael Gove, we prepared a speech. He walked out with Sam by his side, the first signal to the world he was going. I turned up the TV in the Private Office and watched with George Osborne. I put my arm around Kate Fall, the deputy chief of staff, who was in tears. As David got to the final sentences about loving his country, we could see he was choking up.
What felt like the whole of No 10 was now gathered, and David and Sam returned to a round of applause. He waved his hand to silence everyone, but we refused to stop. After a short speech about loving his team, he disappeared into his office.
I could give endless reasons why Remain lost, many of them our fault. But in essence, we thought we were able to take more hits than we actually could. As David told me: “We were asking too many people to vote for an EU they didn’t like and immigration they didn’t want.”

When Baltimore, Ferguson and other protests broke out, I couldn’t travel. I had to work in my job as a nurse. I had bills to pay. I made excuses. I remember the guilt of feeling that I should be there.
So when the opportunity to travel to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, from where I live in Pennsylvania came, I jumped in. My grandmother, who I’m very close to, really didn’t want me to go. She was scared for me. I am 28 years old and I have a young son, but it was time I stood up.
I arrived to a peaceful protest. There was no violence coming from the protesters, but the police had no issue about having their sticks out and one officer had his gun out and pointed – he obviously didn’t see the irony. They were ready to attack us.
I wasn’t aware that the space around me had cleared in the moment that this picture was taken, and I wasn’t scared. I consciously made eye contact with the officers. I wanted them to see me, to see my anger. I wanted them to feel what I was feeling, but there was nothing.
I was arrested and bundled into a van afterwards and taken to a holding facility, where I was strip searched, put in jail clothes and then taken to a prison. I was there for 24 hours.
Nearly six months on, I don’t dwell on what happened that day and I don’t want any praise. It was a moment in time and one I would repeat in a heartbeat.
People around the world don’t realise how bad things are for black people in the US. Racism here is so ingrained – even under the Obama administration. White people care more about their animals than they care about us. There is a disconnect in the way we are living. The way we are being human. That needs to change.
When the Democrats asked us to speak at their convention we huddled together and both our children told us not to do it. They said it would have a terrible backlash. But somebody had to say something. Our niece called us after Trump’s statement banning Muslims, she said: “Should I take my scarf off? I’m afraid.”
My wife Ghazala wrote the speech. I wanted to start by saying: “These are my words. I have not copied it from Mrs Obama,” but she said no, this is not according to the dignity of the occasion.
We expected Trump to understand that sometimes if you let things pass nothing will come of them. Things would not have been so blown out of proportion. We were hoping he would simply say, “Well, that’s their point of view” and move on. But he didn’t.
There have been so many incidents, mostly against Muslims, in the weeks since the election. That is a source of fear. Suppose you and I are walking and somebody comes to me and says, “Get out of this country.” Just that statement, especially to children in schools, and women. That’s a very serious concern.
Somebody sent me two sets of speeches: Hitler’s speeches made in Germany and Trump’s speeches made in this election. Similar thoughts, similar sentiments: “Immigrants are bad. Immigrants are harming us. They’re going to take over our culture, our race, our country.”
Trump hasn’t made one statement saying: “I’m the president of the whole country now and I want everybody to be heartened and have faith in the constitution, in our democratic values.” I’m simply saying, people are concerned, hearten them, say something positive.
To the last breath my son [Humayun, a US army captain, was killed in Iraq in 2004] was doing something for others. So it is under his spirit, under his grace, his example, that we move forward to care for others.
When I came to France last year it was like this, winter and very cold. I slept outside in a place at Calais port and every night would try to get a lift with a big truck into the UK. The French police would fire tear gas and water at us.
I have three cousins who live in Manchester and that is where I wanted to go. In Eritrea I was forced to be in the army where there are no wages, nothing to eat and I was beaten. The conditions are very bad. I ran away to find work so that I could send money for my mother, who is alone.
I didn’t want to go to the Jungle at first because I was determined the next night I would get through. But then I met a man who saw the crucifix I wear and asked me to come and help build the church. I’m a carpenter so I went. By then St Michael’s was made of cardboard, so we put up plastic and wood that we found around the place.
People brought us the tools they had and pieces of cloth for the ground. I met many people who shared my language and my faith. To see the holy pictures and to sing and hear the Amharic songs gave me solace. It was a real beacon of light in dark times. I’m Orthodox, but it was Catholics and Lutherians, Ethiopians and Eritreans and some Afghans who came together in this place of God.
We called it St Michael’s for the guardian angel as it was his feast day when we finished. Visitors came from all around the world to see our place – from America, Russia and Korea and other places.
It didn’t matter that it was not brick, that we had no priest. Hagos Kesete (pictured above) was a student of God who led the services because he had a Bible. I have heard he is now in England. Also the others (who helped build the church) are in England now, I think.
I left Calais for Germany because I heard the French police would be coming to arrest us all. Just after I left it was bulldozed. It did not matter that it was destroyed, the church is in my heart still. Always.
Hasane Tesfase’s name has been changed to protect his family
We got a call telling us the location of the attack – it was another Russian strike. As soon we reached the scene we realised that there were civilians trapped in one apartment. A man was pointing them out.
We had to go through another building to rescue them. The first boy we rescued was five-year-old Omran. My team mate took him out to the ambulance and sat him on a chair and then rushed back to help rescue the rest of the family.
My heart breaks for little Omran, but people need to know this happens every day. Every day we rescue children and families. Every day I meet parents traumatised from losing a child or even not being able to find the body under the rubble. But this time it was caught on camera.
To be honest while I care about Omran, Samir or Ahmad, I care about all the massacres that are happening. I care about all the children of Aleppo. I care that we stop these Russian and Regime bombs.
This was written shortly after the event. We have tried to recontact Bibars Halabi, but have been unable to due to the current Russian and Syrian army offensive
One of our photographers had been reading reports in Nice Matin that local police had given out the first “burkini ban” fines, so he decided to head to the beach the next morning. As most of the world already knows, there has been a lot of controversy in France on the subject: authorities in 15 towns had banned burkinis, citing public concern following recent terrorist attacks in the country.
It was another hot summer’s day and the beach was packed with punters. On arrival, he spotted police fining a woman in Muslim dress, and just 50m away, he could see another woman who hadn’t been fined yet – so he set up his camera and waited. It all took no more than five minutes – the police walked over, gave the woman in blue a fine and asked her to remove parts of her clothing. She left the beach minutes later.
There were reports that beachgoers were shouting support or abuse that day, but that’s not what our photographer heard or saw – he says the atmosphere was totally relaxed as the police wandered around.
I can’t say what I feel about it personally, as it’s important to remain impartial in our profession, but the photographer didn’t feel the police were heavy handed. What’s interesting to me is how the images are being used: are the police abusing their power, or is this woman disobeying the law?
We knew it was going to be hot at the final race of the triathlon world championships. Cozumel is in the tropics and the heat always adds a layer of unpredictability. But the sea was so warm – 28C or 29C. When we came out of the water there was a stop with ice cold drinks. I’ve never seen that before in a race. It’s unheard of.
We got on the bikes and pushed hard to create a leading group of about 10 riders. It was perfect for us. We got off the bikes and started running. With 4km to go, Jonny kicked and looked very easy doing it.
We went round a corner with 500m to go and up ahead I could see Jonny begin to struggle a bit. That’s OK, it was only 500m and he had a big gap. Then there was the final corner and with 200m to go I saw Jonny stumble into one of the officials.
I don’t really know why I stopped to help him. It was just a reaction. It was pure instinct. I put my arm around him. I knew straight away it was heat exhaustion. I kept telling him what an effing idiot he was as I kept us running to the line, because I knew that’s where the doctors were. It was only as we headed to the finish that I started to think if I got him across the line in second he might still have enough points to win the 2016 world triathlon championship.
After we’d crossed the line I started thinking about the rule implications. People began lodging complaints. A jury was called in. And all this was happening while Jonny was in intensive care. It wasn’t until the next morning and I turned on my phone that I saw the enormous scale of the response. It was incredible and so positive. But I’m never going to let him forget he owes me one.
I came across the work of architect Gaetano Pesce several years ago and have been hugely inspired by all of his work, but in particular his Project for a Door. It’s the perfect statement on what is so terribly conservative about the city and spaces around us. Can you imagine the provocation it would cause?
My work matches Gaetano’s own commitment to new technologies as it was 3D-scanned from a live model. It was painted by Sue Day, who has worked for Madame Tussauds and so her way of working is almost forensic.
And here I have to say that it has been really very problematic the piece, at Tate, being referred to as the “Golden Bottom”. It’s not a trophy to be had. The model was Asian, he is not “golden”. Fact always over fiction.
There has been a difference between the reception of this work in New York [where it first appeared at the SculptureCenter in Long Island] and in London. The cities are formed by different rules and types of humour. Also, Gaetano’s version was from the early 1970s, a time of iconic and singular imagery. The plethora of selfies now speaks of the difference. Images are very much “Insta” – you take it, share it and move on to the next experience rather than pore over it analytically. We mark ourselves in front of the Eiffel Tower, or Niagara Falls, or the butt, to say “We were there, we passed through that moment.”
An art work as barometer: the power of the image Gaetano Pesce first asserted being as important to share as an ideology as a giant butt.
Race, gender, class and the future of the monarchy – the profound questions of British identity as the nation faces existential post-Brexit change. So news of Prince Harry’s new girlfriend, Meghan Markle, was the perfect opportunity for the papers to showcase their nuanced grasp of these sensitive issues.
“Harry’s New Hottie!” – the Sun. But the thing that stood out most for me were the descriptions of a “saucy brunette”, a woman “not in the society blonde style” of Harry’s relationships past.
What was that supposed to mean? I had to look up the Suits actor myself, and when I did, the penny dropped. Markle is black.
The press displayed pictures of her mother – an African American “complete with dreadlocks”. “Straight Outta Compton!” said the Mail. It was a case of flaunting a racist message – How could a brown girl with a dreadlocked mother from Compton ever be fit to become a British princess? – but stopping just short of saying it, to avoid allegations of racism.
I spelled it out for the prejudice it was in the Guardian, and was told by other commentators that I was the one bringing race into the equation. But Harry agreed with me. A few days later, Kensington Palace took the remarkable step of publishing a statement condemning the dog-whistle slurs of the British press.
Somebody phoned me and said they’d just seen my image on the Childline advert. It was very upsetting – with the killer clown image being thrashed out all over the media, it was being picked up by all of the internet sites just about everywhere. My picture appeared on two American sites promoting killer clowns and last year on BBC Essex.
I ended up phoning Childline and getting brushed off by a very irate person who insisted that I was too old, and I had to explain: “I’m not phoning up because I’m a child.” We eventually got to the bottom of it and managed to get it to stop.
The killer clown craze raised the profile of clowning, but definitely not for the best. There are a lot of people who have lost jobs because of it. People cancel because they don’t want clowns. If I met these killer clowns I would have more than just strong words with them…
It’s basically young men fuelled by testosterone or alcohol out to get five minutes of fame on social media. It’s got nothing to do with clowning at all. We clowns are here to entertain, to make people laugh and not to scare the pants off anyone. I’m hoping that most people can see the difference between an idiot in a scary rubber mask and a clown with a costume and make-up that looks really good.
We didn’t know we were going to win that day in the High Court. As the judgement started to be read out, one of my lawyers, who was sitting behind me, sent a text saying: “You’d better write something now!” The only piece of paper I had in my handbag was a really scrappy one. A friend saw me on telly and sent a text saying: “Gina, is that really the only bit of paper you could find?” It didn’t matter, I just spoke from the heart.
I didn’t ever envisage, when I was made chief claimant against the government, what would happen over the following few months, and that I would become the focus of a lot of anger. And that’s fine, but what I don’t appreciate is how this has changed us as a nation. In the 18 months surrounding the referendum, we’ve undone all the advances we’d made with regard to diversity and tolerance over the past 40 years. We’re back to where we were in the 60s.
We need to take the heat and emotion out of the Brexit debate. We’ve got to have the best brains, hearts and minds taking us through this. This is not the time for hysteria. We have to have a strategy. We need to talk about realities.
I feel sad for everybody that’s come to England and made it their home. We were the envy of the world: a tolerant, inclusive melting pot that made us all better. That’s not the case any more.
I’m at the point where my family and I can’t go out. We spend a lot of time at home. It’s just preparation as I do think we’ll win, but the fallout will be enormous.
Nigel Farage stuck his neck out for Donald Trump during the election and three days after the vote Steve Bannon, his chief strategist, invited him to Trump Tower to say thank you. We didn’t expect to see the president-elect. No one outside the campaign had seen him. But there were 30,000 protesters outside so we were locked in for several hours. I met Kellyanne Conway, his campaign manager, in a corridor and she said: “Shall we go and see the president?” It was as simple as that.
We took a private lift to the 55th floor. Trump opened the door and said, “There he is!” and gave Nigel a bear hug. He joked, “Nigel, do you think Brexit or my election was bigger?” He was totally relaxed. We sat in his lounge for 90 minutes, talking about everything and anything. Nigel and Trump shared battle stories. Only they know what it’s like to be attacked and abandoned and to come out the other side. It’s a lonely place.
As we were leaving Nigel and Trump were at the door and I said: “I have to capture this moment.” I took the picture on my iPhone. It’s unique. It’s two happy men realising what they’ve achieved against all odds. They’ve made 2016 a remarkable year and probably changed the course of political history. It’s one of those historic moments you’ll look back on and say: “Did I really take that picture?”
We were silent in the lift going down. None of us could quite believe we’d spent time with the president-elect. I showed Nigel the picture and he said, “Oh my goodness. What are people going to think?” I said you have to Tweet it. He said yes and pressed the “send” button.
It’s become very valuable. We’re donating the money we make from it to a veterans’ charity, Care After Combat. A copy signed by Nigel raised £10,000 at an auction. Someone has offered £150,000 if both men sign it.
The term “supermoon” is something that astronomers aren’t terribly happy with as it came from an astrologer and it doesn’t really mean very much. The correct astronomical term is perigee-syzygy – perigee meaning the closest the Earth comes to the moon in its orbit and syzygy when three bodies are in a line in a gravitationally bound system – in this case the sun, moon and Earth, in that order.
I was at home on the night, but for an astronomer who does a lot of photography the full moon isn’t the best time to take photos as it washes out a lot of the galaxies surrounding it, and also we lose various other things to the moon’s glare, including the Leonid meteor shower which peaked around the same time.
That night I was photographing the moon via my garden’s large telescope and in particular the very edge of it as shadows are created and you can begin to see details of the moon’s surface that you can’t see normally. As it’s so bright, my plan was to take pictures of the moon in sections. I ended up with a really high-resolution image of the moon made up of nearly 50,000 images.
The end result had sharp bits and less sharp bits because the atmospheric conditions varied so much. Although this year’s moon was large, the moon that we will get on the 2 January 2018 will actually appear much larger.
After the election we were all very despondent. It felt like a tragic outcome. I had been downtown and Bill, Hillary, Chelsea and Mark were all in the grocery store, picking up their Thanksgiving dinner.
When I spotted Hillary, I went up and introduced myself. I told her how much we admired the campaign and how she was undiminished in our hearts. She made this really sweet, sad happy face and gave me a hug and we took a picture, and she said: “Don’t be discouraged and never give up.”
I had a chance to tell Hillary what I think a lot of people would have wanted to tell her, and I posted the picture thinking it would make people feel better. It got half a million likes, and was picked up by the New York Times, Vanity Fair and Gawker.
In the pictures, Hillary looks a little different because she’s not wearing make-up. A lot of people have said she looks so tired and sad. But, no, I don’t agree. She was so happy to be surrounded by her family. Chelsea came up with her baby, Aiden, and after a while Hillary said, “OK, I need to get into grandma mode now,” and she picked up the baby and left.
I would be very surprised if anyone in Westminster knows more than Naz Shah about the challenges and rewards of integration. For that matter, there can’t be many people in the country who could bring more personal experience to bear on the matter than the Labour MP for Bradford West.
Shah is the eldest daughter of a working-class Pakistani couple who settled in Leeds. When she was born in 1973, her father refused to pick the baby up because she was a girl. He used to beat her mother, who spoke no English and had no idea how to access support. When Shah was six, he ran off with a neighbour’s 16-year-old daughter. With her younger brother, pregnant mother, and their belongings bundled into bin bags, she had to abandon her home and move in with grandparents, fleeing the shame her father had brought on them. They moved 14 times in the following two years, to one unheated, rat-infested home after another; Shah contracted tuberculosis, but had to be her mother’s translator. “I became an interpreter at the age of six,” as she once put it.
Eventually her mother sold her wedding jewellery and managed to buy a house, but only with the help of a neighbour’s married nephew, who demanded a sexual relationship in return. He, too, turned violent, and at 12 Shah was packed off to Pakistan for her own safety. When she was 15, relatives told her to marry her first cousin. If she refused, an uncle warned, even more of her relatives would fall out with her mother. The newlywed couple moved back to Leeds, but when her husband began to beat her – leaving one ear permanently damaged – Shah left him.
Her mother could see no way to escape her own abuser, for she had nowhere to go. When his sexual interest turned towards her younger daughter, she poisoned him with arsenic. Too ashamed and fearful to tell the court of the abuse she had suffered, she was convicted of murder and sentenced to 20 years. It was left to Shah, still only 18, to bring up her 14 and 11-year-old brother and sister.
Despite having left school at 12, Shah built an impressive career as an NHS commissioner and chair of a mental health charity. Now a single mother to three children of her own, she won Bradford West from George Galloway in 2015, only to be suspended by Labour earlier this year after antisemitic Facebook posts she had shared surfaced. The 43-year-old apologised profusely, was reinstated, and won praise this summer for forcing police in Pakistan to investigate the death of a female constituent. The family claimed their daughter had died of natural causes while visiting; she had in fact been the victim of an “honour” killing.
Who, then, could be better qualified than Shah to talk about integration? We meet after Muslims Like Us, a Big Brother-style BBC documentary about 10 British Muslim men and women aired this week. “I really liked it,” Shah smiles. “I thought it was very reflective of British society, I really liked the fact that you saw that we’re not one-size-fits-all, niqab-wearing, hijab-wearing radicals. We’re not everything that you read in some papers. We’re very diverse.” She is considerably less happy, however, about the Casey review, published last week, of “integration and opportunity in deprived and isolated communities”.
Dame Louise Casey was given a tour of Bradford West by Shah while compiling her report, and it raises grave concerns about Pakistani or Bangladeshi enclaves segregated by poor English and “regressive” religious or cultural practices, where “far too many women [are] suffering the effects of misogyny and domestic abuse”. I hadn’t therefore expected the report’s loudest critic to be Shah. When the interview begins, I naively imagine that I will find out what Shah thinks it got wrong, and how to get integration right. Afterwards I wonder whether the MP is still too shaken by the antisemitism row to risk spelling out a clear position. Or perhaps integration is such an elusive conundrum that much clarity from anyone would be unrealistic to expect. All I know is that Shah spoke confidently, at great length, barely drawing breath, and I came away none the wiser. Working out what she really thinks is like trying to grab hold of a fish.
Partly this is because she concurs (“I hear that, I get it”) with almost every opinion that comes up, which is a likable habit but makes hers rather hard to pin down. For example, “I recognise a lot of what Louise Casey’s talking about, because you have a community within a community; Bradford is referred to as Little Pakistan, I hear that, I get that. And I’m very vocal and outspoken about issues around patriarchy and misogyny and male-dominated clan politics. Where I fundamentally disagree is when someone fails to acknowledge that there’s government failings as well. Especially pertinent to Prevent.”
The anti-radicalisation programme is notoriously unpopular among Muslims, so I’m not surprised when Shah says she has not met one in her constituency who has a good word to say for it. “But Prevent has to exist,” Shah quickly adds, “absolutely, and I’m the biggest advocate for a Prevent strategy.” What she cannot accept is Casey’s conclusion that “the government hasn’t been hard enough and hasn’t been strong enough”. She snorts. “Well, how much stronger? Prevent should have been about building resilient communities. It has turned into getting people to police people. That is not how we build resilient communities. The essence in communities has to be about building resilience. And how you do that is through community development.”
I’m not sure what community development means, so ask what Shah’s version of Prevent would look like. “I tell you what it would look like. It would look like a safeguarding programme. If you get safeguarding right for children, you get radicalisation right. Because safeguarding covers all of that – building resilient children and resilient communities.”
And how would that be delivered? “Through empowering children, by having brave conversations, having resilient conversations and questioning things. You empower children to ask questions. You empower communities to say: You need to be answering these questions. If we do it through safeguarding, the family then are empowered.”
What if it’s the family preaching the extremism? “Well, then you need to take action. What would we do if a child was being abused?” For a moment I think we’ve arrived at an unambiguous and comprehensible statement, but when I try to confirm she is saying that a child radicalised by parents should be taken into care, she retreats with: “Well, it depends on what we call radicalisation. Religious conservatism is not radicalisation, there’s a difference. Let’s not conflate the two.”
I ask her to define them, and she replies with an anecdote about walking to school as a child with a girl from a devout Christian family who wasn’t allowed a television. “I used to find that really, really – ‘Oh my God, you’ve not got a telly in the house!’ But does that mean that family was extreme? No it doesn’t, it’s just religious conservatism, how you choose to practise your life. So, for me, when people choose to have a way of life that might mean you don’t watch TV – what you do is you empower those children, you empower those young people, you empower those families, you have conversations with them and those conversations have to be very, very brave, because you’re setting your children up to fail if they don’t have access to social media and they are in mainstream school. Then you need to be talking to people. For example, if a child is in a faith school, if you’re dropping them off and picking them up, you’re not necessarily empowering them to use public transport and be resilient in the community, so you need to have conversations with people even if they’re home-schooling.”
Who needs to have those conversations? I’m becoming lost. “People! Authorities need to have conversations with them people. But if they choose that lifestyle, as long as it doesn’t impact on the safeguarding, then is that a lifestyle choice? That’s the killer question, isn’t it.” Does Shah look at it as a lifestyle choice? “I think some people have legitimate lifestyle choices.”
Is wearing the niqab a legitimate lifestyle choice? “I do not agree personally, on a personal level – and please, if you quote this, do not take it out of context – I do not agree with wearing the niqab, I just don’t get it, right? But when I’ve talked about it, people say: what’s the difference between wearing the niqab and having a full tattooed face? And I’m like, OK.”
Does she consider them the same? “No, but that’s the response I got. And then, if you’ve got barristers who are qualified, who are absolutely very educated, and who have studied Islam and then they’ve gone to it – one of my friends, very very articulate, an amazing woman, I was driving one day and she said ‘Hi Naz’, and I didn’t know who the hell it was. And she’d done it out of choice, she is not an oppressed woman, I assure you, she sees it as her liberation.” Liberation from what? “From her – for her – for her feeling however she wants to feel. That’s her choice. And I was shocked at it. I struggle with the niqab.”
The real issue, Shah feels, isn’t how people practice their faith, but poverty. “For me, that bit’s been missed by Louise.” Casey would presumably say that having no spoken English or any contact with the wider community are causes of poverty. Shah’s own mother would surely have been less vulnerable had she spoken English, and been able to earn enough to support her family?
“Absolutely, absolutely. But it’s not just about speaking English. Integration is a two-way street, and that’s missing from the report.
I ask what a white British family reading this should do to assist integration. Shah tells me about an educated, professional man she knew who was the first Muslim to move into a street of 28 other houses, and sent a card to each of them introducing himself. In return he received only two cards. Then she tells me that not long after she moved into her house – “in a nice area, I had a good job” – the white neighbours on both sides put theirs on the market. But just when I think she has made a concrete point – white Britons need to be more welcoming and neighbourly to Muslims – she adds: “My neighbours didn’t sell up because they don’t want to live next door to Asians. People naturally are just comfortable in their own communities. We gravitate towards people who look like us.”
Does she mean we should stop fretting about integration? “What I’m saying is, it’s not about not worrying about integration, it’s about building resilient communities. And building resilient communities where there’s poverty, that will require integration. You have more chance of getting a decent job and getting out if there’s integration.”
In the course of the conversation, Shah has by now used the term “resilient communities” at least 10 times. When I transcribe the tape later, I find whole paragraphs constructed almost entirely out of buzzwords – community development, empowerment, safeguarding, ownership of narrative, social mobility, two-way street – which sound like a sociologist’s new clothes to me, until I think hang on, what if they’re only meaningless to my white, secular perspective? If only I was more integrated, I would get it. So what exactly are, I ask, “resilient communities”?
“OK, resilient communities are where people have the same opportunities, so equality – equality is a massive thing, so you will not have the same opportunities in Bradford West as you would in a middle-class area.” I would love to pretend that everything now suddenly makes sense, but am not sure it does.
In the dark depths of winter, it can seem like the joy of sowing seeds and taking cuttings is a long way away. Yet there are two beautiful species you can propagate right now, that will give you instant houseplants in exchange for almost zero effort and which cost you essentially nothing: dracaenas and cordylines.
Both Dracaena marginata and Cordyline fruticosa are exotic houseplants that originate in the world’s tropical zones. Their vibrant foliage colour and elegant architectural forms have made them hugely popular in both the houseplant trade and floristry.
Both also happen to be among the easiest of all plants to take cuttings from. Indeed, as I discovered when working in flower shops when at university, the cut stems of both species (often up to 45cm long) will readily root even in the water of a vase.
While most florist greens fade to a brown mush that is destined for the bin in a week or two, these species will happily start to grow away, giving you plants for free. In fact, commercial growers of these houseplants will essentially be taking the exact same cut tips that are sold in floristry, and rooting them in compost for a just a few weeks in heated glasshouses before selling them at up to a quadruple mark-up.
For home growers, this makes buying them as cut stems always the cheapest way to get hold of these two species. They are so quick and easy to root from large stem sections, and they will look almost identical, giving you instant impact.
To get started, simply pick up a few of these stems, often sold as “ti plant tips” or “cordyline tips”, at your local florist. If they don’t happen to have them in stock, do ask, as most good florists will be able to order them in if given a week’s notice.
To root them, either pop them in a clean vase of water in a bright, warm room (my preferred option) or dip the cut end in rooting powder and plant them up in a small pot of well-drained cutting compost. The advantage, in my experience, of the vase technique is you won’t need to keep watering the newly planted cuttings to prevent them from drying out.
As long as you regularly change the water to prevent the build-up of bacteria or fungal rots, the success rate is extremely high. Using a clear glass vase will mean you can monitor the cleanliness of the water (and the root growth) easily.
Once roots are 5-10cm long the new plants can be potted up in any ordinary compost and grown on just like any houseplant. Ten years after graduating I still have some of mine from my uni days, adding a splash of year-round colour to my living room.

Outside an old warehouse in Christianshavn groups have gathered round a giant snow dome to watch a man wearing an inflatable Santa suit pretend to ride a reindeer. This is Flying Tiger Copenhagen HQ (or Tiger, as the Danish retailer was known until it officially changed its name earlier this year) and Christmas is in full swing.
Inside, the offices are the epitome of Scandi style: wooden floors, original beams and big picture windows overlooking the water. Shelves of sample products are a snapshot of what’s soon to arrive in stores. There are remote control sumo wrestlers and virtual reality goggles on one; a plastic snowball scoop and puppets on another.
Anyone who has shopped at Tiger won’t be surprised by the products. “Fun” is a key part of the formula that has seen the company grow from a market stall in Copenhagen 21 years ago to having, at the last count, nearly 680 shops in 29 countries. Last year, sales in the UK alone were £62m and global bestsellers are the simplest items: popping candy, pencil sets, soap bubbles.
In such a rocky financial climate it’s a retail phenomenon. There are collaborations with artists such as Yoko Ono and David Shrigley (a mini version of his Fourth Plinth “Really Good” sculpture has almost sold out); a monochrome series of graphic prints has been picked up by Parisian concept store Colette; the first global concession has opened inside Selfridges Birmingham and the company has scooped several prestigious awards, including, most recently, a Red Dot award for their pink and green food containers.
Of course, a crucial component of its success is the low prices. What began as a pound shop – founder Lennart Lajboschitz left his brother’s girlfriend in charge and she couldn’t find the prices so he told her to charge 10 kroner, the equivalent of £1 for everything – now sells the odd item, such as a record player, for £100. “When we opened our first UK store in Basingstoke in 2005, some press called us a cool Scandi company,” recalls brand director Tina Schwarz. “We hadn’t seen ourselves like that. We were just a Danish store selling cheap items. It was a game changer because then Lennart hired the first in-house designer. The vision was to make design affordable.”
Described by one retail analyst as “an Ikea marketplace on speed”, Tiger attracted middle-class mums with its clean-lined look and retro music. And it’s true, the shopping experience does set Tiger apart (it’s far less stressful than going to Ikea), but so do the products. While others such as Wilkinson’s have made their name selling cut-price practical household items, Tiger taps into lifestyle trends – not just the obvious money-making occasions such as Halloween or Christmas.
As the craze for crafting took off, they introduced knitting needles and brightly coloured wool and, in response to the surge in cycling, this January, they are launching a range of bicycle kit. By contrast, failed retail giant Woolworths stuck to traditional categories such as confectionary and toys and, in shoppers’ eyes, wasn’t seen as being distinctive enough. There’s no danger of that at Tiger. Today, up to 50% of the 300 new lines introduced each month are designed in-house, either from scratch or given a Tiger twist with quirky new graphics and packaging. “Design can be serious, sometimes even boring,” says innovation and design director Federico Bosisio. “We are trying to make our customers smile.”
Chief executive Xavier Vidal reels off stories illustrating exactly how Tiger achieves this, including a memorable Ireland vs Italy rugby game earlier this year. “There were 30 Italians wearing our nodding flamingo hats. You could see them from anywhere in the stadium.” For Christmas, he tips a green wood Christmas tree as a product to look out for. “Here at HQ ours is decorated with plastic sausages, and why not? We want to surprise people.”
From your taste in decorations to how happy you are with your presents, psychologists have studied every aspect of the festive season. So what does your attitude to Christmas say about you?
1. Do you deck the halls? Are you a minimalist or a maximalist when it comes to decorations? How far do you go when it comes to decorating the outside of your house, and what does your taste say about your personality?
Which of these best describes you?
a) What do you mean decorations?
b) I have put a wreath on the door. Does that count?
c) I have a few lights and a tree.
d) Blackpool illuminations is the way I like to play it.
If you said (b) or (c), then your neighbours probably perceive you as friendly, and showing a decent community spirit; if you said (a), less so. But there’s a twist. If you really went to town (d), then you may well enjoy fewer social interactions with your neighbours than those who keep the decorations more tasteful. These were the findings in a classic 1989 study conducted at the University of Utah when volunteers were shown photographs of strangers’ homes taken in the festive season, and then asked to rate their owners’ “friendliness” and “cohesiveness with their neighbours”. When the residents themselves were interviewed the findings were the same. The decorators reported more social contact with their neighbours than did the non-decorators. While residents who really went to town (the “d”s) reported less social interaction with their neighbours than those who kept things subtle.
2. Gold, frankincense and… Do you have a receipt for that? Christmas wouldn’t be Christmas without the unwanted gifts: the itchy jumpers, the bubble bath, the comedy socks. But how happy are you generally with your presents?
Thinking back to last year…
a) What would you estimate as the total cash value of gifts you received?
b) How much would you have sold them for on Boxing Day?
If your answer was higher for (b) than (a), then you’re a sentimentalist. If your answer was lower for (b) than (a), or about the same, then you’re a cold, hard economic realist. A classic study, in which participants were invited to sell their gifts to the experimenters, found that, on average, people demanded 25% above their cash value before they would part with them, with the extra premium representing the gifts’ sentimental value. So don’t worry too much about finding the perfect gift – it really is the thought that counts.
3. We all want some figgy pudding. Here’s one to try out on the kids. Get them to write down the first five words that come into their heads when you say ‘Christmas’. Do this yourself if you don’t have a child handy.
Now, how many of your five words were food related? 
a) 0-1; b) 2-3; c) 4-5
This test measures the strength of your association between Christmas and food: (a) weaker than average, (b) about average, (c) stronger than average. Again, though, there’s a twist: the stronger this link (ie the more food-related items you listed), the less likely you are to be overweight. This was the counterintuitive finding that emerged when this study was run in Germany. The reason is that, for overweight children, chocolate, cakes and stodgy dinners are a daily occurrence, rather than something associated particularly with Christmas. But, if you have a tendency to get stuck in during the festive season, don’t feel too bad. While, most people overestimate the average festive weight gain as 2kg (over 4lb), it is actually only a quarter of that.
4. A merry Christmas? Be honest. Is it all about the presents, the booze, or reuniting with family and friends? Whatever you look forward to most will define your happiness levels.
Please rank the following activities in terms of importance to you:
a) Seeing family
b) Religious activities
c) Buying presents 
d) Getting presents
e) Drinking
If buying and getting presents ranked highly on your list, you probably find Christmas unsatisfying. If family and religion were your top activities, you probably find it enjoyable. If you put drinking at the top of the tree, then you probably experience less stress (perhaps because you’re too comatose to notice the inevitable family arguments). These were the findings of a survey published in the Journal of Happiness Studies, which also found that older people, and those who tried to have an environmentally conscious Christmas, also reported more enjoyment of the season.
5. Dreaming of a white Christmas? Finally, read the question, put your fingers in your ears and close your eyes.
Can you hear “White Christmas” playing? 
a) Of course not, no.
b) Now you mention it, it’s very faint, but I can just make it out.
If you said (b), this may suggest that you’re more prone than average to fantasy and even hallucinations. In an experiment conducted at Maastricht University, students were played white noise and asked to press a button when they heard Bing Crosby’s classic cutting through the static.

This is a glorious time of year for confectionary lovers, and in a few days time I’ll embark on my annual mission to hoover up boxed chocolates with customary enthusiasm. 
 My mission includes house visits, so although I would favour Fairtrade artisanal chocolate brands with top notch ethical sourcing, I can’t always choose.
The good news is that there is evidence the big chocolate brands are wising up with regard to their supply chain. Ethical labels are now widely used on Christmas chocolates in Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Sweden.
It’s true that current standards are still dismally low; West African cocoa production in particular is intrinsically linked with modern day slavery. But this scramble to include “ethical” symbols shows that many chocolate makers have finally realised they must invest in a sustainable supply chain for their key commodity – cocoa.
Big Chocolate (the corporations that control the market) has invested in sustainable production programmes. For example Lindt & Sprüngli sources 100% of its West African cocoa bean supply from Ghana and runs a major sustainable farming programme. Ferrero states that by 2020, 100% of its cocoa and sugar cane will be certified as sustainable.
But research also shows that in countries such as China, where the festive chocolate box count is now huge, sustainability isn’t under scrutiny and many brands don’t make ethical efforts. This extends to packaging. A chocolate box destined for Germany will be packaged in recyclable materials, but for China is packaged in rigid plastic. This is what we call an ethical pick and mix.
Brands should be aware that as chocolate watchers (and eaters), we appreciate your efforts so far, but know you could do better.
Animal Equality, the animal advocacy organisation, wants you to get the big picture with iAnimal (ianimal.uk), a 360-degree virtual reality experience of the lifecycle of factory-farmed animals from birth to death featuring footage from 13 investigators in six countries, including the UK. The experience is narrated by actor Amanda Abbington, who broke down in tears when she watched the footage for the first time.
Embroidery and embellishment is overlooked in fashion – except in the rarified echelons of haute couture – so embroiderers can be among the most exploited. Most consumers assume embroidered products are added cheaply by machine. So it’s cheering to see this skill used as an opportunity.
SEP Jordan, a luxury, sustainable accessories brand, has created an embroidery business employing women artisans in refugee camps to embroider linen shawls, keffiyeh scarfs and clutch bags (stocked in the UK by clerkenwell-london.com).
Palestinian refugees in Jordan are subject to restrictions on employment and free schooling, and it’s worse for women. Now, thanks to this initiative, these woman can earn using the traditional cross-stitch techniques passed down from one to generation to the next.

Veneta, 3 Norris Street, London SW1Y 4RJ ( 020 3874 9100). Meal for two, including drinks and service: £120
On paper, which is to say the menu, it sounded fabulous: a fried “polenta, speck and fontina sandwich”. You’re offering me a ham and cheese toastie, in a fancy Venetian themed restaurant? I’m in. What arrived was two flavourless blocks of carbohydrate inside a breadcrumb shell the colour of a neglected child’s tea. They looked like fish fingers, but tasted like sofa cushions. I pulled them apart to find a meagre smear of cheese and a fragment of ham.
Polenta gum guards aside, Veneta, part of the polished restaurant group behind Opera Tavern and Dehesa among others, is not an actively bad restaurant. The front of house team is professional, dealing artfully with the moment I knocked over my glass. But if you’d asked me immediately afterwards what I’d eaten I’d have struggled. I’d have mentioned a plate of smoked anchovies, which was a victory of shopping, and a winter salad of bitter greens, which was all depth and quiet, astringent menace. In a good way. I long ago stopped taking notes in restaurants, figuring that if I couldn’t recall what I’d had for dinner that spoke volumes. With this one I had to dig out the receipt.
There was wide-ribboned pasta with a goat ragu which was fine and reasonably priced at £7.50; a small pork rib eye was okay for £9.50. Apparently, I also had a dish of a mackerel tartar and another of roasted artichokes, but neither left an impression. I recall the two medium sized scallops with a splodge of sweet pumpkin purée. I recall how quickly they were gone. But my eye can’t help resting on the final tally of £138 for two, pushed up by a wine list which can’t spell bargain let alone offer one.
It’s an unfortunate way in which to end the year. I’ve spent much of 2016 talking about price pressures: about the way Brexit has hit ingredient costs and how young cooks are going underpaid, while the middle-classes whinge about their restaurant bills. I’ve defended restaurateurs and chefs, and then Veneta comes along. I can see where the money went. It occupies a space in a development south of Piccadilly Circus called St James’s Market, which is probably meant to sound like it’s full of hoary-handed tradesmen. Instead it’s an outbreak of brutal, glass-clad blocky offices probably funded by chaps with secret concerns about the size of their genitalia. And so, pushed up by rents, dinner costs £138 and you end up wondering why.
Happily there have been better things this year. Early on I loved the lavish approach to Sunday lunch at Zelman Meats, all rosy pink beef and tumescent Yorkshires (so much so that, at year’s end, I chose it as the place for a works Christmas do). The punchy, Sri Lankan stews at Hoppers, and the exceptionally well managed queue – they text when your table’s ready so you can sod off for a drink – forced me to accept there was a place for non-reservation restaurants. It can keep prices low. The bill of £44 for a meal including dark, peppery pork curries, and fragile lacy dosas, rewarded the wait.
Jun Tanaka’s Charlotte Street venture, The Ninth, proved that serious food does not have to come with armies of serious waiters or snowfields of white linen. Even now I can recall his dish of salted beef cheeks, with morels and bone marrow and a jus that ought to be available on prescription from the NHS.
Outside the capital there were more thrills than not. I loved the food at the catering college restaurant in Cardiff, but still managed to piss off half the city for saying the Welsh capital’s dining choices were meagre. It made the local TV news. (Six months on I’ve had more quiet emails agreeing with me than not).
In Hereford Rule of Tum served me a cracking burger, and I still dream of the Korean pork belly at the Garden House Inn, Durham, all crisp meat and slippery melting fat and luscious chilli-boosted sauce.
My own snobbery was challenged at Mannings in Truro, where I had to go back into the kitchen to check that they weren’t just opening bags of ready meals. The menu was so restless, stretching from Thailand to Japan to the American Midwest and back again that I couldn’t see how they were doing it all from scratch, but they were. Likewise, Maray in Liverpool presented a terrifyingly restless menu and yet delivered on every dish. Go for the falafel. The Bull and Ram at Ballynahinch, Northern Ireland, did outrageous things with the best beef. I could mention Riley’s Fish Shack in Tynemouth again, but that would be embarrassing. Except to say they suffered a small fire recently, nobody was hurt, and by now they should have re-opened.
There were stupidities. There always are. At Tapas 37 the fire alarms went off but not for long enough to stop us being forced to eat terrible food that should never have escaped the kitchen, and Gino D’Acampo proved that being famous is not the same as being a good restaurateur. But then we knew that. The new general manager of the Guinea Grill, Oisin Rogers, confessed to me after my visit that, when I ordered the truffle chips, he’d legged it down to the nearby Westbury Hotel and begged a fresh truffle off chef Alyn Williams because he didn’t think truffle oil would do. It was a wasted effort. I dismissed the chips as “slightly undercooked” though I liked almost everything else.
My off-the-clock eating habits have remained stuck in their groove. I kept going to Chinatown’s Four Seasons in Gerrard Street for their brilliant Cantonese roast duck, though I abandoned the dry fried green beans for the monks beard in sizzling pot with ground pork. I went to Baiwei on Little Newport Street for deep fried pork ribs crusted in cumin, salt, sugar and chilli. I kept returning to Richard Corrigan’s Bentley’s for oysters. I also went to various branches of Yo Sushi, ignored the lousy sushi and ordered the dark, sticky beef teriyaki with garlic and the deep fried chilli squid. Do that and it’s fine. Don’t judge me.
And I rolled my eyes at comments that spending money in restaurants is obscene. If it is, so is spending money on cars or tickets to football matches or tech. I have no interest in those. But I do like restaurants and in 2017 I will continue to travel hopefully. Have a great Christmas.
Located right next door to Veneta, and perhaps rather better suited to the minimalist possibilities of the stark architecture, is the Japanese ‘brasserie’ Anzu. It’s a gentle move upmarket from the team behind the brilliant ramen joints Tonkotsu (oh their chilli oil!) of which I am a fully declared fan. The menu includes king crab and pork gyoza and Label Anglais chicken teriyaki (anzulondon.com).
One for the 2017 bucket list. Chef Kyle Connaughton was part of the team at Heston Blumenthal’s Fat Duck as it won its third Michelin star. He returned to his native US a few years ago and has finally launched Single Thread Farms, in Healdsburg, California, one of the most talked about restaurant openings for years. But you’ll have to save up. Dinner is $294 a head (singlethreadfarms.com).
Further to last week’s terrifying news of the cocoa and rum flavoured crisps from Tesco, comes the bombshell that Lidl has launched negroni flavoured crisps. One taster described them as ‘too orangey’. Question: what is the right amount of orange for a crisp?

Returning from Mexico, a land whose food heritage is Unesco-protected, travellers share tales of life-changing meals – and no one does this more than chefs. Indeed, René Redzepi is so enamoured of the nation’s cuisine that Noma’s final residency will take place in Tulum next year. And judging by the number of Mexican chefs invited to guest at top UK restaurants (including Enrique Olvera of Pujol and Jorge Vallejo of Quintonil), ours are equally fond of the country’s cooking.
It’s been nine years since Thomasina Miers launched Wahaca with the intention of introducing British palates to Mexican flavours. This year, the group fed more than three million people. The rest of this restaurant sector has also expanded at pace, largely due to mushrooming burrito bar chains. In 2016, Waitrose’s website witnessed hits on Mexican recipes increase exponentially, up 867% for pork fajitas; while Tesco reports that 50% of UK households plump for Mexican due to its relative ease and family friendliness.
Except, what with fajitas being Tex-Mex, and burritos barely known outside the far north it seems we’ve mostly been scoffing an ersatz US take on its neighbour’s plates. But with three Mexican restaurants opening in London within weeks, are these imposters soon to be found out?
The new disparate bunch includes El Pastor, by the Hart brothers of Barrafina-fame, and Crispin Somerville; Breddos Taqueria, the concrete incarnation of the street food outfit; and Corazón by Laura Sheffield, a former manager at Corbin & King.
“It’s like buses, three come along when you’ve been waiting ages for one,” says Breddos’s Nud Dudhia. Their first permanent site sees them take years of street experience and feed it into a menu that nods to regional fare, yet remains theirs.
“Essentially what we’re doing is take ancient recipes and techniques and apply modern flavours and ingredients,” he says. “We’ve mostly gone with the Yucatanian style of cooking, so no electricity or gas, just fire.” Alongside familiar items such as their signature rib-eye and Baja fish tacos, Breddos’s menu features Oaxacan pizzas known as tlayudas.
El Pastór, a dream of the Harts and Somerville since they ran El Colmillo nightclub in Mexico City decades ago, boasts an entire floor devoted to tortilla production, including nixtamilisation, which ensures smoothness of texture via a soaking in limestone solution. “It’s this corn tortilla thing that is so massive,” says Sam Hart. “We’ve got a handmade grinder with volcanic stone rocks and criollo corn, sourced through a third-generation tortilla-maker who works directly with farmers. Criollo is under pressure as hybrid varieties have higher yields, so, in a tiny way, we hope to keep the native breeds alive.”
El Pastór’s menu centres upon Mexico City’s famed al pastor taco, a result of Lebanese migration, which led to the vertical schawarma method being applied to a tower of pork known as a “trompo”. Other dishes include chicharrón de queso, a rolled cheese crisp, and sopa de tortilla. “At El Pastór there will be 10 or 12 freshly made salsas. They’re a big part of what we’re doing, as we feel that the joy of Mexican eating is that you get a taco and then start adding things to it.” says Hart. “It’s like a friendly competition of who can turn theirs into the most delicious thing.”
For Corazón, Laura Sheffield says: “This is the food I grew up eating. I felt there was room for someone to do it with a little more style; stripping away the Chihuahuas and sombreros and tapping into a part of Mexico that’s beautiful in a way Londoners will appreciate.” Wary Brits barely know the cuisine. Sheffield selected Corazón’s menu accordingly. “We are serving pozole [pork stew] and sikil pak [pumpkin seed dip], really authentic dishes, but then we also have a steak tartare taco.”
As well as this trio of restaurateurs others, such Edson Diaz-Fuentes, are hoping Britain falls for the full scope of the country’s cookery. Last summer, he opened Santo Remedio, with that very purpose. “My aim was to offer things no one had tried, or expected, like aguachile, green ox tongue or pig’s ear confit. I want to change not only perceptions of Mexican food, but also people’s lives by supporting local farmers.” Sadly, following stellar reviews, an electrical fault forced him to close, but he hopes to reopen soon. In the meantime, he’s cheering on the others: “The trend seems unstoppable, and that’s good for everyone. Mexican food can be so healthy and nutritious. Hopefully, with Noma in Mexico, they will show how diverse it is.”
There is a specific constipated care with which a relative, upon opening your present, smiles, “You really shouldn’t have.” Their eyes widen and fall at the same time as if their social skills are prolapsing, and their voice falters as they are the most honest they’ve been all year.
I have seen this face more times than I care to remember, yet every year it stings. Because I’m bad at presents, both giving and receiving. Mainly because there is nothing I want, but also (I just shouted for confirmation from my boyfriend in the kitchen) because I’m so incredibly tight. Poor guy, he is always chasing the success of his first gift to me – a cardboard replica he’d made of a Chanel bracelet I’d ripped out of The Face.
Unfortunately he set himself up to fail – it was unbeatable. There is not enough goodwill in the whole of 2016 to enable a man to sit down for a whole afternoon with a glue gun and scissors, even if it is for someone they really quite like.
As I unwrap any present, my heart beats fast with the anxiety that it might have cost over £15. And then that I will be responsible for getting the giver’s money’s worth – I can’t help but visualise their personal finances in my head like a NatWest app. But all presents come heavy with expectation. The worst was a red hardbacked notebook my late grandma gave me when I was 10, saying: “This is from the post office and was very expensive, so I only want you to use the pen in it when you’re going to write something brilliant.” It remains empty.
Giving is even harder. In the olden days I’d introduce people to my favourite TV shows with a grand boxset of DVDs, or show off with an out-of-print film, sourced from eBay. Now you can just message them a link to Netflix and they’ll reply with a thumbs up – there is nothing to be unwrapped.
It felt oddly prophetic to stumble upon Santacon in London last weekend – the annual pub crawl for bearded losers. Every year across the world, thousands of people dress up as Santa and march through cities retching “Ho ho ho” into their held-out hats. The effect of thousands of people wearing Santa costumes, though, is that the essence of Santa – the sense that he is a benevolent gift-giver, a lap-offerer, a person obese for only the right reasons – disappears. In its place there is a mob.
Standing on the tube among pissed Santas I thought of the famous deindividuation experiment, where the number of electric shocks participants gave their subjects doubled when they were dressed in hooded costumes, and I wondered what would happen if those participants had strapped big white beards on, too. Caught on that platform, it became all too clear. A sackful of Santas can’t give; they take. Which only strengthens my case to do away with the horror of presents. If even Santa appears to have given up giving, then what hope is there for the rest of us?
The problem is that there is no way to win in a culture that correlates great gifts with great love. Even when you’re employed and only tiptoeing into your overdraft, too many Januaries have begun with bath bombs undetonated but relationships exploded.
If only we could all agree that presents are rubbish. The idea that the subtext of every conversation is expected to be funnelled into a virtual gift list makes me never want to chat again. Shopping is an art, like everything else. There is no reason to think that just because the high street is alight with reindeer we will suddenly become experts; that a year of listening will suddenly be carefully condensed into the single item our brother will cherish, making him rethink the decade you lost touch, that dark time you think of as his Leeds period. And that this item will be available lunchtime in Debenhams.
Christmas presents are never just presents. They are responsibilities in starry paper, they’re a family test, emotional landfill. They’re books that were never written to be read, or pass-agg statements, or irony off the internet, or something that means too much, or jewellery you’ll die in to make a point. They put pressure on us to express our feelings through the medium of searching through Amazon on a Sunday night, and I wish they’d die. Also don’t get me started on “Christmas drinks”.

Francesc Ricart Cava Brut (from £7.98, Cambridge Wine; The Sampler; The Vineking) Buck’s fizz is still many people’s first drink on Christmas morning. I prefer a kir royale myself – a finger of crème de cassis (Aldi’s Specially Selected Crème de Cassis at £6.99 is a good buy) topped up with a decent but not super-expensive sparkling wine, such as Borgo Regio Franciacorta Brut 2012 (£8.99, Lidl) or Francesc Ricart’s subtly floral cava – both of which are excellent buys even if you’re planning to drink them au naturel. If it has to be buck’s fizz, I’d go for something a little less obviously acidic (there’s enough acidity in the orange juice). A decent, sweetish prosecco, such as Marks & Spencer’s Prosecco (£8) works best, just as it does with peach juice in a bellini.
Nyetimber Blanc de Blancs 2009 (from £31.75, Hennings Wine; Slurp; Berry Bros & Rudd) The world of sparkling wine is so much more diverse than it used to be, and fine fizz is no longer confined to a handful of regions. Contenders for this year’s Christmas bubbles chez Williams range from the utterly thirst-quenching red cherry and subtle tannins of Italian red fizz Chiarli Pruno Nero NV (£12.95, Great Western Wine), great with cold cuts; the racy redcurrants of Jansz Tasmania Premium Rosé (£17.50, Oddbins); the gentle, spring-blossom foaminess of Michele Chiarlo Moscato d’Asti 2015 (£7.40, Booths); and a fine example of the English sparkling style by arguably this country’s finest wine producer, a 100% chardonnay from West Sussex’s Nyetimber.
Winemakers’ Selection By Sainsbury’s Blanc de Noirs Champagne NV (£20, Sainsbury’s) If it has to be Champagne, there are some good buys in the supermarkets. Sainsbury’s has a fine pair in its Winemakers’ Selection range: both the savoury Blanc de Noirs NV and the graceful Blanc de Blancs NV are a snip at £20, while the Co-op’s Les Pionniers Brut NV (£16.99) is as creamily interesting as ever. For sheer quality, however, the gloriously rich Charles Heidsieck Brut Réserve NV (£37.95, Slurp) must be the best value around, while Larmandier-Bernier Latitude Extra Brut NV (£34.95, Lea & Sandeman) is a luminous laser-guided passage from 2016 into, let’s hope, a better new year.
The people behind Alpkit know a thing or two about mountains. They’ve turned their passion for all things vertical into a business and now offer all the top-notch kit you could ever need to climb, run, walk or ride in the Alps – hence the name Alpkit. See what they did there? They’re based in the marginally more forgiving Peak District, and one of their most popular bikes is the Sonder Transmitter. It’s a super responsive hardtail with Rockshox up front. Sram gears and disc brakes means you can treat the trails like a fun-loving hooligan and still come home in one piece. If you fancy a go, book a demo at their Nottingham factory or take a full test ride for £39 a day. If you then buy the bike, Alpkit will refund your money (alpkit.com).
People often moan about how hard it is to buy gifts for men. Well, if they are cyclists it’s not hard at all. Here are five last-minute ideas to help make someone’s Christmas that little bit more special. And, of course, if your mother/wife/sister/auntie is a cycling fan, she’ll love these, too.
Odlo Classic bike polo shirt, £55 Odlo Practical and comfortable: this short-sleeve bike polo shirt is perfect for long weekend rides as it has two back pockets, or it will happily great casual T-shirt during food and drink pit stops next summer.

It’s also free of the chemical bisphenol-a (BPA), commonly found in a variety of consumer products, and known to cause to a range of health problems.
dhb Blok short sleeve jersey Intersection, £45 Wiggle The Intersection jersey offers you the wow factor as well as great performance. Bold, bright and distinctive, the design is based on Strava heat maps from the roads around London.

The dilemma I am 26 years old and three years ago I was going through a difficult period in my life following my parents’ divorce after a long marriage. I was befriended by a work colleague, a lovely older woman who is now 50. We have become very close, but not in a physical way. I’m a virgin and have never experienced physical intimacy. That said, I am and have always been attracted to her, but I’ve known from very near the beginning of our friendship that the feeling isn’t mutual, I think because of our respective ages.
Recently, she met a man who she has told me she is in love with. This has been painful for me. I’ve had a physiological reaction as well as an emotional one. Thinking about her with him brings tears, a pounding heart and sleepless nights. I want to remain a close friend, but I feel an overwhelming sense of a lost love. How do I combat these feelings of grief and loss, deal with my jealousy without harming her, and replace my selfish feelings with selfless ones?
Mariella replies Start your own life maybe? It sounds to me like you’ve been treading water for too long and this just might be the event to propel you into a more rewarding interaction with those around you. I’m not convinced you ever wanted a romantic relationship with this woman, although it’s perfectly likely that you entertained the idea of a physical one. Then again, until she found romance elsewhere, the lack of a physical side to your friendship seems to have been of relatively little importance to you.
You don’t explain why you are still a virgin at quite a mature age. That leaves me with an awful lot of unanswered questions. Is it for religious reasons? Or perhaps you are not interested in women. Is the alternative difficult for you for cultural reasons? Or do you simply not have much interest in sex?
These are all questions that you could and should be asking yourself. Honest answers will offer you illumination on your current situation and be conducive to ensuring greater future happiness. I appreciate this latest twist of fate is taking its toll on you, but to recover you need to understand why you feel so bereft. I’m pretty sure that’s not as straightforward as you think.
Putting questions about your romantic life aside, isn’t it typical of the perversity of human nature that you should be fixating on your loss rather then celebrating the friendship you’ve enjoyed? We’re bad at counting our blessings, but this is definitely a scenario where you should focus on your good fortune in having this woman in your life at a time when you really needed her, rather than what might have been. She’s still there after all, sharing her news and keeping you up to date. Her new relationship doesn’t seem to be a threat and has had no discernible impact on your friendship, so celebrate her good fortune and be as much of a friend to her as she has been to you.
What a lucky guy you are to have discovered her shoulder to cry on when you were at an emotional low. In that situation, vulnerable and insecure, it would have been all too easy to fall into an unsuitable but convenient set of arms. Instead, you found safe harbour. In the intervening years if there was more than companionship between you I’m sure you would have unearthed it. It sounds, however, like you need someone to take the reins and she may indeed be a lost opportunity on that score.
Could it be that rather than get over the upset of your parents’ divorce you found alternative parenting with this mature friend? If so, you may be reliving the abandonment fears your parents’ separation precipitated. Put things in perspective: separate irrational responses from rational fears and most importantly start thinking about a relationship of your own.
Remaining a virgin is a choice you’re entirely justified to make, but it is unusual. Letting this upset prove the catalyst for a sexual relationship with a suitable partner is writ large on my prescription pad. Your imagination is running overtime, but what you’re missing is not nearly as elevated or exciting as you imagine. Take comfort from the fact that if you’d had an affair it would have been very unlikely to last as long as your friendship has.
You have a great buddy. Try to be open with her. Tell her you’ve been upset about what you feel is a loss. Ask for her help as you take your first steps toward seeking a lover of your own. I imagine she will be just as supportive as she was when you had to face up to your parents’ inadequacies. Take pleasure in the fact that she confided in you about her relationship; take advantage of her maturity and wisdom, and let her guide you on the path to your own passion.
Spending your days regretting things you haven’t done is a waste of oxygen. It’s far healthier to acknowledge those feelings and then use them to ensure your future expands in tandem with your increased understanding.

As you’ll have noticed, in our issue devoted to this year’s most memorable news images, there is an immediacy to a photograph that we can’t help but respond to. A picture can trigger a buried memory and recall a precise moment in time much more rapidly than words. But why exactly?
Neuroscientists have known for many years that humans have an extraordinary ability to encode pictures. In one study, first carried out around 50 years ago and repeated since, people are shown 10,000 photographs and, a few days later, another 1,000 – half from the original batch and half new. Within seconds, respondents point accurately to the ones they’ve seen before. Which is why, at this time of year when you look through a photo review, a picture glanced at six months ago will still chime and feel familiar, even though you couldn’t call it to mind a minute ago.
This is possible because our brains are so efficient at storing the ‘essence’ of a picture, capturing not just the subject but specific visual qualities. You can’t bring this to mind actively, it’s what we call a ‘passive effect’. If you were asked to recall a news image from March, you may struggle, but if you saw a stack of photos from that time, you’d instantly know the ones you’d seen before.
Before we get too full of ourselves, it’s worth knowing that at least one other animal shares a similar ability – the pigeon. In studies they show high levels of recall when presented with different images – helpful for finding food. For us it may be linked to social relations or just navigation.
However trivial the picture, it’s the recognition and the rush of familiarity that is fun - an added benefit that’s lost on pigeons but satisfying for us.

A previously unseen portrait of the Queen by a photographer famed for his work on album covers and fashion has been released by Buckingham Palace to mark the end of the year in which the Queen celebrated her 90th birthday.
Nick Knight, well-known for his fashion collaborations with Alexander McQueen, Yves St Laurent and Yohji Yamamoto as well as album covers for artists such as David Bowie, Lady Gaga, Bjork and Paul Weller, photographed the monarch and Prince Charles in the white drawing room at Windsor Castle.
The picture, shot last May before the final night of the Queen’s celebrations at the Royal Windsor horse show, has Prince Charles in a dinner jacket standing beside the Queen.
Knight, 58, whose debut publication in 1982 was a book called Skinhead, has had his work showcased in the Victoria & Albert Museum and the Saatchi Gallery.
“It was a great pleasure and an honour to photograph Her Majesty the Queen and the Prince of Wales at Windsor Castle. I wanted to create a modern portrait that showed warmth and humanity as well as strength and tradition,” he said of his portrait.
The Queen thanked those who helped her celebrated her special day with a party in the Mall but said at the time: “How I will feel if people are still singing happy birthday to me in December remains to be seen.”
Theresa May knows it. Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe exploited it to stunning effect. Even singer Chris De Burgh was aware of the transformative powers of the colour red.
This is not just the judgment of the stylist who helped the prime minister choose her Amanda Wakeley number for a charity bash last week, or Howard Hawks, who dressed Monroe and Russell in glitzy red robes in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Countless psychological experiments have confirmed that wearing red clothing increases attractiveness and sex appeal.
A 2010 paper, published in the European Journal of Social Psychology, found that when a woman wore red it prompted men to sit closer to her and ask more intimate questions. The effect is considered to work the other way, too. A paper published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology produced evidence from seven experiments which demonstrated that women perceive men to be more attractive and sexually desirable when viewed against a red background and in red clothing. As an article in the latest Research Digest of the British Psychological Society says: “Red displays in the animal kingdom also often indicate sexual interest and availability – complemented by the cultural connotations of red with passion and sex.”
The festive party season has been dominated by the colour. Last week, Amy Adams wore red for the recent premiere of Nocturnal Animals in New York, as did the Duchess of Cambridge for a Buckingham Palace reception. Fashion retailer JD Williams told the Evening Standard that sales of red dresses have outstripped black ones by 43% this year.
But what if red’s allure is just a myth? A team of Dutch and British researchers has published three attempts to replicate what they call the “red effect”. This included testing whether it was more pronounced in a “short-term mating context”, something, as the digest says, supports “the idea that red signals sexual availability”. However, not only did the research, published in the journal Evolutionary Psychology, fail to uncover an effect in the mating context, all three experiments failed to demonstrate any effect of red on attractiveness.
In the first study, about 200 young Dutch men were asked to rate the attractiveness of a woman pictured on a dating site, as well as how much they wanted to have sex with her. The woman was shown wearing either a red, black or white shirt. Some men looked in the context of finding a one-night stand, the rest in terms of searching for a long-term partner. In both cases, wearing red didn’t affect the rating.
The same results were found with a sample of nearly 200 heterosexual American men. In the third study, researchers recruited about 400 men via an Amazon affiliate site and asked some to study an image of a woman in a red shirt and others of her in a white shirt. The men’s responses confirmed that the colour had no effect on their rating of the woman.
“The lack of evidence for a red effect in our three experiments … leads us to question the robustness of the red effect in human mate preferences,” the researchers concluded. “We argue … that if red has an effect, then it is likely to be small.”
However, Christian Jarrett, editor of the Digest, offered a word of caution for anyone thinking of giving up on red. “Just as it is wise not to place too much faith in the findings from single studies, we should also interpret failed replications with caution,” he wrote. “These new null results do not mean there is no red effect, but they do raise questions about its robustness, and the possibility that there was a bias in past research to publish positive results.
“A generous interpretation is that the red effect could be more significant in real interactions than in lab-based research using static photos, because the colour might influence the wearer to behave more flirtatiously, for example.”
The fabled benefits of wearing red clothing had already been thrown into question. Earlier this year, a study of waitress-tipping found that, contrary to expectations, men gave smaller tips to women wearing red. This is not to say the colour is without its supporters. Psychologists studying the relationship between colour and voting believe red can still be a powerful influencer, one that historically has benefited the US Republican party.
“Red is arguably the most vibrant colour on the colour wheel,” according to colorpsychology.org. “It is attention-getting and induces a sense of power and excitement.”
In sport, too, red appears to have talismanic properties. A 2009 study by sports psychologists at the University of Münster in Germany, reported in New Scientist magazine, found that players who wear red clothing score 10% more in competitions than when playing in other colours. England football fans are painfully aware that the victorious World Cup team of 1966 wore red, rather than their usual white. They have not won a World Cup or European Championship since.
It is being dubbed “frenzied Friday” and is set to be the busiest food shopping day of the year in the UK, with an estimated 10 million people expected to hit supermarket aisles on 23 December.
After a year of grocery pricing offensives, this Friday is when the key commercial battle will be fought – and fought well into the evening, to cater for shoppers who are still working.
The Centre for Retail Research has calculated that shopping is set to peak on the Friday before Christmas – the day when many will receive their December pay cheque. It estimates that shoppers will spend £894m – or £865,158 a minute – on food, drink and gifts that day. Spending in Britain is set to make up 25% of total expenditure that Friday across Europe. The average British family spends £800 on its Christmas shopping (including food, drink and gifts) – almost double the European average.
The day on which Christmas Day – this year on a Sunday – and subsequent bank holidays fall affects shopping patterns. “I think this year shoppers will start buying their fresh produce from Wednesday onwards, to make sure it’s in tip-top condition,” said Joshua Bamfield, an analyst with CRR. “Friday is definitely going to be the busiest day and convenience stores will benefit from people ‘topping up’ at the last minute.”
Bosses at Asda and Waitrose expect Friday to be the most frenetic day, with the latter anticipating its till takings will be three and a half times higher than normal Friday trading. The UK’s largest retailer, Tesco, along with Sainsbury’s, expects shopping to be more spread out over the week while the Co-op convenience store chain, which has 2,800 shops across the UK, has earmarked its busiest day as Christmas Eve.
For those hoping to steer clear of jammed aisles, the hour from 11am on 23 December is traditionally the busiest of the year for grocery shopping.
Many retailers make more than half of their sales and profits in the three months before Christmas, and despite the marked shift in Britons’ shopping habits to “little and often” and online, the festive fresh-food shop still tends to be a large one, done in person at the supermarket. Waitrose opened the Christmas delivery slots for online shopping on 22 September this year due to customer demand – 93 days before the day itself.
Fresh turkeys go into most stores tomorrow and alongside the millions of pigs in blankets, cooked hams, sprouts and mince pies that will be piled up in gridlocked trolleys, supermarkets expect strong sales of more unlikely essentials such as festive handwash and even posh toilet paper as hosts prepare to welcome guests.
Marks & Spencer said its shoppers will be splashing out all the trimmings and want help to reduce time spent in the kitchen by turning to prepared foods. The retailer expects to sell more than 6.5 million pigs in blankets and over 720 tonnes of stuffing. M&S was the first retailer to launch ready-made fresh gravy 20 years ago and expects to sell 500,000 litres in December, easing the stress of struggling with chicken stock. Despite shoppers having the chance to stock up in advance with wine, beers and spirits, Asda says that on Friday alone it expects to sell more than 620,000 litres of Budweiser.
Aldi has prepared for peak shopping on Friday by organising 1,000 extra trucks on the road to meet increased demand. Tony Baines, Aldi’s joint managing director of corporate buying, said: “We’re gearing up for our busiest week of the year as shoppers stock up on festive treats ahead of the big day.”
But this year environmental charities are urging shoppers to exercise restraint and not buy food they don’t need – or ensure they use up their leftovers. According to the government’s waste advisory body, Wrap, in the UK an estimated two million turkeys, five million Christmas puddings and 74 million mince pies are thrown away each year. It is also estimated that, three-quarters of us struggle to eat all of the food we buy for the festive season.
“It can be so easy to get carried away at the supermarket in the run-up to Christmas, as none of us want to run out of food,” said Trewin Restorick, chief executive and founder of environmental charity Hubbub.
“Unfortunately that can often lead to food going to waste as we buy more than we need. The best way to avoid this is to plan ahead before you go shopping and if you do overbuy don’t forget to freeze what you can.”

It was always going to be a momentous Strictly Come Dancing final, and not just because Britain’s very own end-of-pier Fred Astaire, head judge and all-round score-bellowing legend (“SEVERRRN!”), Len Goodman, was leaving the show.
This was a momentous series in many ways, not least due to the phenomenon of former Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls. At one point tipped to win, Balls clung to his unexpected popularity like a famished baby monkey to a teat, until finally he was flung off the show the week after Blackpool, where he’d jived to “Great Balls of Fire” (Did you see what they did there?).
In Blackpool, Ed rather overdid the gurning: at one point looking as shocked as if he’d espied Tony Blair, wriggling suggestively towards him on the dancefloor, a rose clamped between his teeth. It also can’t have helped that Balls was dancing in a way that looked as though all the important bones and muscles had taken the night off from his body.
So it was goodbye to Ed, though viewers did see him again in the final, group-dancing with the other 2016 contestants, and reprising his now-legendary Gangnam Style routine in a manner that cried out for urgent medical attention, and raised great existential questions (can a man’s hips be made of Lego?), but in a fun way.
The final was, as always, introduced by Tess Daly (Northern Lights Goddess), and Claudia Winkleman (Uber-Kohl-ed Goth-Baby), and judged by Goodman, Darcey Bussell, Craig Revel (“Fab-u-lous!”) Horwood and Bruno Tonioli, who graced the panel in their inimitable styles, like a cross between a depleted lineup for the Last Supper and the crammed dressing room of a provincial repertory production of Hello Dolly.
However, the night belonged to the finalists, singer turned presenter Louise Redknapp and her partner Kevin Clifton; actor Danny Mac and his partner Oti Mabuse; and presenter Ore Oduba and his partner (and Kevin’s sister) Joanne Clifton. While some might have perceived Oduba’s presence as helping (at least in part) to soothe the ongoing row about how black contestants get voted off more easily on Strictly, frankly, it was blindingly obvious that he was only there because he was so diabolically good.
Soon, it was time for the three finalists to strut through three dances, the first one selected by the judges. Gene Kelly’s widow, Patricia, turned up to applaud Ore’s Singin’ in the Rain, Louise once again donned the foxy Flashdance leg warmers for the chachacha, and Danny executed a quickstep that was so quick, fire extinguishers must have been at the ready in case his inner thighs caught fire.
So far so good, nobody had dislocated their shoulders, or choked on a runaway spangle, and if the floor was getting a bit slippery from the vats of fake tan melting beneath the lights, then this was nothing the finalists couldn’t handle, as they launched into their show-dances. All of which were brilliant – Ore and Joanne bringing chic Hollywood glamour, Louise and Kevin elegance and romance, and Danny and Oti, excitement and drama.
Then it was time for the finalists’ own personal favourite dances from the series. In this last group, Redknapp’s Argentine tango was all street lamps, slashed satin and a segment towards the end where she was dragged along on her toes by Kevin – which looked a little as though he was nicking a particularly ravishing rolled-up rug, but these are what classic Strictly moments are made of.
Then it was time for Ore to jive, kicking and flicking so incredibly fast that I was worried he was going to shatter his pelvis, and take Bruno’s eyes out.
After that, there came Danny’s ferocious samba – Danny sporting his winning shirt-not-done-up look, grinding away like a Ken doll on heat.
While the exhausted finalists paddled their way back through the small lakes of fake tan to their dressing rooms, there ensued a fair amount of Strictly-schmaltz as Goodman was given an emotional send-off, complete with a standing ovation, and the professional dancers delivering a truly magical routine that at one point looked as though all the tiny, pirouetting ballerinas had escaped from their jewellery boxes for the evening.
After that, all the non-finalist Strictly contestants lined up to bitch and carp about why it was all their professional partners’ fault that they’d not done better, how their feet were still oozing blood and blisters, and how they wished their good-for-nothing agents had never talked them into doing it.
Of course, none of that last bit actually happened. I just really wish that something like that would happen (just one year, just for the hell of it). In reality, as usual, everyone gushed and sobbed about what a wonderful time they’d had in the “Strictly family”, and how they’d never wanted it to end.
However, it had to end, and it did so with the announcement of Ore Oduba as the worthy winner, not least for the way he and Joanne Clifton risked life, limb, and the rest of their lives on hospital trolleys, jumping from one sparkly platform to another during their showdance.
What a winner, what a final, what a series. And the best thing is that it will never truly be over. As Ed Balls is going to find out: this kind of golden footage never dies – it just ends up on clip shows.
Amsterdam-based fashion photographer Mirka Laura Severa usually shoots for the likes of Louis Vuitton and Lacoste, but for her latest project, commissioned by Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin, she showcased winter fashion on snowmen. “Usually it’s beautiful models wearing beautiful clothes looking beautiful. I enjoy those images, but sometimes over-beautified can be boring,” she says. “Why don’t we make it different?” For the shoot she travelled to the Hintertux glacier, Austria, where weather conditions were so challenging her hands froze to the camera: “We were at 3,250 metres for the last shoot, when suddenly everything became completely white. It was so cold that ice crystals covered our bodies.”

Someone should have told me I needed to work on my Cockney accent. Nearly everyone in the Mary Poppins cast was a Brit but no one said anything. I was given an Irish coach whose Cockney was much better than mine. Years later I asked Julie [Andrews]: “Why didn’t you tell me?” She said it was because I was working so hard.
I wanted to be a magician. From an early age I’d stand in front of a mirror for hours practising my sleight of hand.
Attitude is in the genes. I’m the kind of person who gets out of the right side of the bed. I’m full of ideas and make a list of the things I want to do. Bringing up my family I noticed two of my kids were like me, but the other two woke up grumpy. I’m not sure that’s something you can change.
I am hungry for contemporaries. It’s disturbing that there aren’t many people who can remember what I do. I have a few people I drop by on – like Carl Reiner, my mentor and idol, he’s 94. And Mel Brooks. We mostly talk about how the past affects what we’re doing in the present. We see the mistakes and the roads not taken. There’s very little nostalgia involved.
I had no idea we were poor as a kid. I grew up in the Great Depression so nobody had much of anything. My dad was a travelling salesman and told a good joke. His side of the family all had a light touch when it came to life; I think I inherited that.
Absence does not make the heart grow fonder. My first wife and I lived apart for a year – I was working in LA and she was in Arizona. The geographical separation didn’t work.
It took me a while to figure out alcohol had to go. I was shy in my 20s. I had trouble relating to strangers and I found I’d loosen up with a Martini. Then it got a hold of me.
I’m married to someone half my age. We learn from each other. Her generation questions everything. Arlene [Silver] had trepidation about marrying someone so much older, but it became inevitable. She’s a singer and a dancer and we perform together, which we love.
You should have done as much unlearning as learning by the time you’re in your 40s. Growing up you get your head stuffed with a lot of things that aren’t all true, and you have to rid yourself of some.
You can’t just sit around. A lot of older people bemoan that they can’t do what they once did. But you have to find new things to replace them.
My house looks like it’s been attacked by clowns. I’m always putting things off, like tidying up. I’m a terrible procrastinator. My wife’s the same. She’s kind of turned the place into Disneyland. She has balloons and characters everywhere and is building a toy guesthouse outside.
I would like to live to be 100. I’m working on it. I dance every day and go to the gym. And emotionally, I don’t feel old at all.

So closely are some of the giants of 20th-century literature associated with alcohol that modern readers might be forgiven for thinking a serious booze habit was once the equivalent of a degree in creative writing from the University of East Anglia. It’s not surprising that alcohol permeates the work of writers such as Kingsley Amis, Ernest Hemingway and Dorothy Parker. They were writing about what they knew.
In many of the short stories in Shaken and Stirred: Intoxicating Stories (Everyman Pocket Classics), a drunken incident is the motor of the narrative. For example in Alice Munro’s “An Ounce of Cure” a lovestruck teenager gets paralytic while babysitting and becomes an outcast at school, “but there was a positive, a splendidly unexpected, result of this affair: I got completely over Martin Collingwood”. In Frank O’Connor’s “The Drunkard”, a boy’s disastrous encounter with a pint of porter prevents his father going on a long-anticipated drinking spree. Both stories pivot on alcohol: the effect in Munro’s is cathartic; in O’Connor’s, it’s a reversal of fortune (peripeteia, if you want to get all technical.)
Shaken and Stirred also features an extract from The Lost Weekend by Charles R Jackson, another one of literary America’s great boozers. Drink enables Jackson to show us the innermost thoughts of the protagonist, Don Birnam, a failing writer. After a few glasses of rye consumed in a bar, he starts to daydream of literary success. He veers between giddy optimism and neurotic self-doubt. Without the drink, it would seem clunky, but having his thoughts come out in a progression of alcoholic intoxication draws the reader in. “Suddenly, sickeningly, the whole thing was so much eyewash” he thinks after another drink. Something all writers and daydreamers can sympathise with, not just drunks.
Alcohol is particularly useful for crime writers. Fictional detectives spend a lot of time in pubs and bars not just because they like drinking but because that’s where they pick up information, and one of the novelist’s problems is finding something for characters to do when they are thinking or engaged in conversation. Giving them a drink and a cigarette makes it appear natural. Drink oils the cogs of the plot.
A good example occurs in Raymond Chandler’s The Long Goodbye. Private investigator Philip Marlowe meets a character called Lennox in a bar. Lennox explains his problems with his wife and we learn that she is terrified of something. Soon afterwards she is found dead. If they had this conversation on the street, it would look staged. In a cafe it wouldn’t work either. Alcohol has to be around so that it seems natural when characters open up and tell stories.
Part of the reason fictional detectives have drink problems is because it gives them an air of mystery. Think of Rebus in Ian Rankin’s novels or Sam Spade in Dashiell Hammett’s. Cocaine serves a similar purpose in the Sherlock Holmes stories. Detectives solve crimes but they are also trying (and always failing) to solve themselves. Addiction is outward evidence of their inner turmoil.
In Hangover Square by Patrick Hamilton, drink is synonymous with mental illness. Written in the 1930s, it is set in a grim, smoky Earl’s Court. The hero, George Harvey Bone, is hopelessly in love with Netta, one of the great monsters of English literature. The more he drinks, the more he is prone to moments where a switch flips in him and he sees clearly that he must murder her and move to Maidenhead. When these episodes strike, the narrative on the page is disrupted, reflecting Bone’s mental disintegration: “He still had the gin bottle in his hand. Watching her carefully, he held it by the neck behind his back. Now! Now! Now! he thought.”
The drink of choice in Hangover Square is gin, which is a byword for a particular kind of British frustration. It’s tied up with boarding houses, borrowing money, dead ends, broken dreams and unhappy pubs. Think of the works of Graham Greene or Julian Maclaren-Ross. The gin-soaked colonial type is a fixture of English fiction. Here is Flory, the hapless hero of George Orwell’s novel Burmese Days: “I can never get it into my servant’s head that some people can exist without gin before breakfast.” Orwell’s description of the taste of Victory gin in Nineteen Eighty-Four is a masterclass in squalor:
Alcohol can also perform the opposite function, however. In Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms, the constant listing of drinks such as marsala, cinzano, asti spumante and martini, serves as a reminder that there was a normal life before the war and will be afterwards. For Charles Ryder in Evelyn Waugh’s Brideshead Revisited, “this Burgundy seemed to me, then, serene and triumphant, a reminder that the world was an older and better place …”
In the same novel, alcohol plays a less benevolent role, as a weapon in the snob’s arsenal during a scene in which Ryder has dinner in Paris with Rex Mottram, an arriviste Canadian businessman and his love rival. Ryder orders a cognac that is dismissed by Mottram as “the sort of stuff he puts soda in at home. So, shamefacedly, they wheeled out of its hiding place the vast and mouldy bottle they kept for people of Rex’s sort. ‘That’s the stuff,’ he said, tilting the treacly concoction till it left dark rings round the sides of his glass.” Waugh wants us to see Mottram as a vulgarian and Ryder as a man of taste, but also reveals his own prejudices.
Of course, the ultimate boozy status‑seeker is James Bond. This is from Casino Royale:
Here’s a man who knows what he wants and how to get it. We’re meant to admire Bond, I think, for his discernment but you could just see him as a bit of bore. It’s only a short leap to the horrendous characters in Bret Easton Ellis’s American Psycho:
Wine connoisseurship features in two stories in Shaken and Stirred. In Edgar Allan Poe’s 1846 story “The Cask of Amontillado”, Montresor lures a rival, Fortunato, down to a deep cellar with the promise of old amontillado sherry, much prized in the 19th century. Along the way, Montresor gets Fortunato drunk and bricks him up alive behind a wall. The plot of Roald Dahl’s short story “Taste”, meanwhile, hinges on identifying a rare Bordeaux, but the real amusement comes from the pretensions of the wine taster: “a prudent wine … rather diffident and evasive but quite prudent”, he says. In a famous scene in Brideshead Revisited, Ryder and Sebastian Flyte try to outdo each other with their descriptions of a wine:
The miseries of the morning after are even richer ground for comedy. Though PG Wodehouse’s description of the aural pain of the hangover in “The Man Who Gave Up Smoking” will surely never be bettered: “The noise of the cat stamping about in the passage outside caused him quite exquisite discomfort.” But the best hangover description in literature comes from Kingsley Amis’s Lucky Jim:
Whatever you want to do in fiction, alcohol can help: move the plot forward, or provide comedy, tragedy, explication, or a window into a character’s soul. Chandler once wrote that, if you’re stuck writing a novel, “have a man come through a door with a gun in his hand”. But having a drink in his hand might work even better.

I planted three yellow kniphofia this year; none flowered. One grew quite big, with lots of leaves but no sign of buds. My soil is clay but I added compost and grit to improve the drainage. They get sun for about half of the day.
Be patient. You have decided to put sun-loving plants in a moderately sunny place; they are either just getting used to their home or sulking a bit. Either way they’ll settle in. Lots of leaves is a good sign: it means the plant is putting down roots. If the other two don’t start to show signs of healthy growth next year, consider moving them to somewhere with more sun.
Once kniphofias (red-hot pokers) get comfortable, they are robust, easygoing plants, but think of it this way: if you wanted to go to Greece to lie on the beach and someone offered you the Hebrides, pointing out that both had white sand and turquoise waters, you might be a bit miffed. Once you’d found some good wellington boots, though, and realised the beaches of the Hebrides are just as lovely as the Aegean’s, you’d settle in. But I will say this: afternoon sun is stronger than morning; if they are sitting in gloom all afternoon, they may sulk for ever.
At the beginning of summer I nonchalantly scattered a mixed packet of annual ornamental grasses, partly because the slugs had eaten everything else and I felt a bit desperate. The oats and barleys have nearly all come up in the wrong place, as scattered seed is likely to do, but still look much more marvellous than I would have expected. Over the winter I am going to edit the garden, removing some overly rambunctious geraniums and making space for more grasses. This time they’ll be perennials, because life is short enough and there’s dancing to do.
Plenty of perennial grasses are reliable, easy to grow and low-maintenance. They offer structure without being too formal and give rhythm to the garden; make the right choices and they provide plenty of seasonal interest. And, praise the Lord, slugs aren’t that interested in them. In other words, I’ve seen the light with grasses.
There are some very handsome ornamental grasses out there, but many are just too big for small gardens. You could rarely say molinia was overpowering: it’s a gentle breeze of a grass, a flirty diaphanous thing that plays with light, perfectly accents low plantings and can sit happily at the front of the border. Purple moor-grass Molinia caerulea subsp. caerulea ‘Moorhexe’ is upright and neat, a narrow column of grey-green leaves crowned with soft purple flowers in spring, the whole thing turning touches of russet-red in autumn. It grows 45-60cm tall. M. ‘Edith Dudszus’ is taller at up to 90cm and has darker flowers that teeter between rich plum purple and black, floating above tussocks of grey-green foliage. It comes into its own in winter and can grow in sun and partial shade.
New Zealand wind grass (Anemanthele lessoniana, formerly Stipa arundinacea) is a little undervalued because it’s so widely available, but those soft waves of pink flowers are really something and the foliage is evergreen, tinted orange, yellow and red in autumn, so it adds something year-round. It’s not particularly long-lived (you get five good years at best) but it knows its own flaws and will happily self-seed. All you have to do is pot up your replacement and weed out the rest (or give them away). It can look a little scruffy in late summer, so comb it with your hands to remove any dishevelled flower heads or tired leaves. It’s rather soothing, like brushing hair.
You can never fail with Hakonechloa macra, which makes waves of arching green foliage and keeps itself to a fairly contained clump. It works well at the front of the border or in a container, and comes into its own at the end of summer. The new growth in spring is particularly pleasing.
For shadier spots use Melica altissima ‘Alba’, which looks best planted in elegant drifts. The flowers are delicate, like tiny grains of rice that catch the sun and shiver in the slightest breeze. There’s something rather magical about this grass, particularly in a woodland setting.

It is a Tuesday afternoon and I am sitting in the hairdressers, having both my usuals: a short back and sides and a mild attack of awkwardness. Apart from the snip of scissors, a silence has descended. It’s not the barber’s fault; he’s covered all the regular bases (my hair, my weekend plans, where I’m going on holiday). Now the conversational onus is on me. I’ve long used up my quota of “Really?” and the sanctuary of the hairdryer is some way off.
Charisma: it is not something I have ever been accused of having. But how much does a person need? This ethereal quality (or lack of it) has been credited both with the rise of Donald Trump and the fall of Ed Miliband. For better or worse, it is the reason Boris Johnson is foreign secretary and Tim Farron is still “Who?” When, in those distant summer months, Michael Gove announced he was running for the Conservative leadership, he brought it up in his first speech: “Whatever charisma is, I don’t have it.” And it was true: his political career soon came to a grinding halt.
Can you learn charisma? The man sitting next to me in the hairdressers thinks so. His name is Danish Sheikh and he is a charisma coach. He has worked with executives from Yahoo and the BBC, training them in “confidence acquisition” and personal magnetism. Sheikh reckons he can turn your average anyone into a Clooney or a Bardot. And for two days I will be his student.
I sit in the hairdresser’s chair pondering possible small talk. It shouldn’t be that hard: I’m intelligent enough, I like sport and music, and keep up with current affairs. There are endless, countless ways to connect. “What about you?” I ask the barber, eventually. “Going anywhere nice on holiday?”
In the mirror, I see Sheikh wince.
At its most basic, according to Sheikh, charisma is an ability to connect with people through sheer force of personality. “You can’t put a price on a skill like that,” he says, although he does: £150 an hour, to be precise. And plenty of people are paying. The Ministry of Defence, Bupa, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Sony have all hired coaches who specialise in the area. Olivia Fox Cabane, author of the 2013 bestseller The Charisma Myth, says business leaders are willing to pay more than $100,000 a year for her advice. The United Nations once invited her to lecture about improving leadership skills using behavioural science.
Why is this “it” factor so important right now? I ask Richard Reid, a British cognitive behavioural psychotherapist who, clearly a man not shy of his own charm, calls himself “Mr Charisma”. Reid specialises in a range of areas – addiction, depression, crisis management – but in 2009 developed one of the UK’s first charisma courses. Since then, his clients have included Transport for London, the National Crime Agency and Google. “These organisations don’t want managers any more,” he says. “They want leaders. And leadership means emotional intelligence. To all intents and purposes, that’s charisma.” Those without this so-called emotional intelligence, or EQ, lead by instruction, Reid says. Those with it, lead by influence, which is more effective. “They attract people to their vision through rapport,” he explains. “In business terms, if you look at the brightest companies today, staff believe in the ethos and culture of what they are doing. That doesn’t happen by accident. It is an atmosphere created through charismatic leadership.”
Increasingly, he says, his clients include young professionals, mid-earners and creatives. He recently coached one young man who wanted help before a best man’s speech. “It’s a competitive world,” Reid says. “If you can learn how to connect with people, you find more opportunities come your way. Plus it makes everything, from job interviews to parties, more enjoyable.”
It sounds too good to be true and, for me, that may be the issue. Can this stuff truly be taught?
I am not naturally magnetic. I feel I walk a line between awkwardness and arrogance. One, I suspect, is an affectation designed to disguise the other, but I am 33 and no longer sure which is which.
Being charming – likable, even – does not come easily, and I am sure there are opportunities and friendships I have missed out on as a result. For some time, I wrote a column in a local newspaper, which was popular enough; but when readers met me, I felt their disappointment. One old chap told me straight: the spark that was there in print didn’t exist in person. I told him I knew. But how do you change what’s inherent in you?
Dr Erik Matser is a neuropsychologist who has worked with Chelsea football club and the Dutch Olympic swimming team, and who specialises in talent optimisation. “Only a minority of people are truly comfortable in their own skin,” he tells me. “For everyone else, some coaching – whether or not you call that charisma coaching – would help. Perhaps once there was a stigma attached, but no longer. It’s right to want to be the best version of yourself, and that requires help. Human development is too complex to do on our own. More people are recognising that.”
He suggests this should be taken even further. “I think there is an argument for emotional intelligence – empathy and interpersonal skills, in particular – being taught in schools,” he says. “This is one way to both help people reach their full potential, and to create a better world.”
Meanwhile, Sheikh, my coach, is self-taught. Originally from India, he was a nerdy teenager turned Yahoo product manager who, frustrated by his inability to make friends, spent a decade studying the psychology and neurology of social interaction. When he realised that, by his late 20s, he had transformed himself, he went full-time guru.
My own first impression is that I like him but, well, he doesn’t seem very charismatic. “But you like me,” he counters. “So we’re already in a positive relationship – this is charisma.” Checkmate.
His first impressions of me are more brutal. It is the morning after my haircut. Yesterday, he followed me everywhere, watching my interactions, and now he has written his observations on a whiteboard. It doesn’t make easy reading. Yet it is only in recognising our weaknesses, I am told, that we can address them.
So here goes: I struggle with small talk, lack confidence entering a room, have closed body language and, because I feel too much eye contact is an invasion of personal space, I don’t do it enough. Unless you’re engaging me about certain trigger subjects (football, literature, the 19th-century history of Britain’s railways), I appear to lack enthusiasm.
“But don’t worry,” Sheikh concludes, cheerfully, “we’re going to fix all this.”
Over 48 hours, I learn a lot, including how to stand like a gorilla (feet apart, arms wide: this subliminally says high status). But the overriding principle Sheikh imparts, the one that informs everything else, is that charismatic people project their own value while simultaneously making others feel valued. Their magnetism comes from combining authority and empathy.
Sheikh’s sessions are based on the idea that we can develop, practise and perfect various subliminal techniques and interpersonal skills that will create this outward effect of importance and warmth. I think of the most charismatic people I know and wonder if that’s simply what they have done; worked hard to perfect these skills. I think of Martin, a journalist 30 years my senior. The room doesn’t stop when he enters, but he never looks out of place, anywhere. He carries himself with both gravitas and levity and, crucially, he’s not the sort of person who changes his manner to fit in.
I ask Martin if he’s aware of this: did he consciously work on it? “I think I just listen more than most people,” he shrugs. “But that’s not a studied thing. It’s just because, if I’m talking, I don’t learn anything new.”
I tell him about my charisma lessons, and he nods along, asking questions. What does he think, I ask after a while. “Load of bollocks,” he says. “Fancy another pint?”
Until recently, charisma wasn’t something I gave much thought to. If I ever considered it, it would be in the same way I considered a Cruyff turn: a nice skill to have, for sure, but not something I thought I needed. Without charisma, I have achieved the traditional fundamentals: partner, house, a job I enjoy well enough. When I first called Sheikh, it was out of pure journalistic intrigue. I wanted to know why a quality first identified by the ancient Greeks had become such a 21st-century must-have; I wanted to understand how something generally regarded as innate could possibly be taught.
But now, when I start to reflect on the situations where I wish I’d had more magnetism – a greater ability to connect – the list seems pretty endless: making friends, making professional contacts; ultimately, making more of myself. With it, perhaps I would have got that job, or bonded better with that person. Perhaps I wouldn’t be the guy who struggles with small talk at parties. Perhaps interacting with the world wouldn’t often feel so unfeasibly difficult.
When it comes to acquiring empathy, one of those twin facets of charisma, Sheikh says listening actively and intently is key. Showing interest in people makes them feel good: they then associate that feeling with you. “If you’re even momentarily distracted, people pick up on this, because humans detect micro-expressions in about a 50th of a second,” he explains. “If you learn to stop your mind wandering – to be entirely present – the person you’re with feels special.” Reid has a lovely way of phrasing the same advice: “It doesn’t matter if you’re backstage with the Rolling Stones,” he declares. “If you’re talking to the guy cleaning up, he should be the only person with your attention.”
Projecting your own value is more difficult to learn. No one likes the guy who has rattled through his achievements by the first canape, but, equally, no one remembers the person offering nothing. The solution is ambiguous. Don’t boast, but don’t underplay yourself; don’t be po-faced but don’t self-deprecate; ultimately, Sheikh says, “don’t blatantly sell yourself but, well, be aware you do need to sell yourself”. So that clears that up.
We should remember, too, Sheikh says, that our immediate feelings towards someone are dominated by evolutionary instinct. Good posture and deepened voice signals strength, wide stance suggests authority, and an open body indicates trust. Essentially, the unspoken message you’re going for is: genuine, dependable, useful in a sabre-toothed tiger attack.
Sheikh and I drill other basics. Entering a room (chin up, shoulders back), holding eye contact (“Don’t stare – that’s staring – four seconds max, then break,” he says), and hand gestures (“sparingly”): done right, all will establish your presence and value. The same goes with voice tone: don’t speak too fast or too slow; vary your pace to keep your listener’s attention.
It is classroom-style work, but not as you know it. I am lectured in the theory – making notes as we go – and then we run practice routines. For instance, small talk: I’m told by Sheikh to keep things breezy, speak expressively and make questions open. He pretends to be first my hairdresser, then a commissioning editor, then a stranger at a party. Not once, I can confirm, do I ask him where he’s going on holiday.
He takes me through a mindfulness exercise, teaching me to be in the moment with the person I am talking to. Sheikh shares his personal trick: if he finds his attention momentarily wandering, he takes off his glasses and cleans them. This action, he says, jolts him back into the present and nudges him to return his focus. When he tells me this, I admire its simplicity. Later, over a drink, while in full-flow with one of my better anecdotes, I notice him cleaning his glasses.
I should also be confident. But how? By employing some biological chemistry and remembering a past triumph. This fills your brain with oxytocin, a hormone that blasts away fear and anxiety. “Do it before you enter a room,” Sheikh tells me, “and you’re on a natural buzz, ready to conquer the world.”
That night, I do exactly that before walking into a bar. Not as good as a quick livener, perhaps, but it’s early days. I’m meeting Sheikh for the climax of the course – our practical exam, if you will. We’re here to make chitchat with strangers. We spark some conversations and they go OK. I am not convinced people in bars, English bars especially, really like that moment when a stranger starts speaking to them – I swear I see terror in some eyes – but in the haze of the night there is laughter and topics I could never have predicted. A physics graduate explains black holes, and a long-distance lorry driver reveals how this time tomorrow he’ll be in Arbroath.
“Beautiful town,” I say, going too far with my flow of positive affirmation. Have you been, he asks, surprised. I pause and consider my options. “No,” I tell him after a moment. “But one day, fingers crossed.”
At intervals, Sheikh offers gentle feedback. Don’t cross your arms; when speaking, make eye contact with everyone in the circle, that kind of thing. Don’t go overboard on empathising with people, is another one. I’m pretty sure he’s referring to Arbroath.
Remembering all my objectives – hands, eyes, vocal expressions, presence, active listening, projecting, oxytocin, serotonin – is a monumental, sweat-inducing effort. Realising I’m struggling, I tell a couple we’re speaking to about my charisma coaching. It starts a debate. “Not having it,” is the opinion of the guy. “Being charismatic is just about being yourself – no tricks.”
This contradicts much of what I’ve learned over the past two days, but I sort of agree. Fine-tuning social niceties is one thing, but methodically changing your entire behaviour to appeal to others strikes me as the exact opposite of gaining an “it” factor. Isn’t an absence of authenticity even less appealing than an absence of magnetism? I think of this, and then of all the opportunities and friendships I worry I’ve missed. Maybe my authentic self just never wanted them that badly.
I share this with Sheikh, who is ready with a contradiction. That guy who thinks charisma is “just being yourself” is, it turns out, a photographer, and we end up swapping numbers with a view to working together. “That’s a connection built on rapport,” Sheikh says, “which is exactly what charisma is. This has worked for you.”
Do I feel changed? Not as such. I know for a fact I’m never again going to stand like a gorilla or enthuse about Scottish towns I couldn’t find on a map. But perhaps charisma, at its core, is simpler than that anyway; it’s about understanding better who you are, and deploying the best version of yourself.
As we leave the pub, Sheikh and I shake hands and go our separate ways. Then he calls down the street to me: “Hey, let me know how the next haircut goes?” He gives a thumbs up. He’s deliberately giving me a last blast, I think, of his charisma. And I like him for it.

Flying. When it starts to get bumpy I have to pull a blanket over my head and silently scream.
What is your earliest memory?
On holiday in Llandudno, walking along holding my dad’s hand and listening to my new red patent leather shoes clip-clopping on the pavement. I felt like a big girl. I was six.
Which living person do you most admire, and why?
Bruce Forsyth, because not only is he the most talented showman, he is the most generous individual.
What is the trait you most deplore in yourself?
Extreme germ phobia: toilet door handles, the ice-cream seller holding your cone with his bare hands, touching raw meat or chicken.
What was your most embarrassing moment?
Lactating on live television. Luckily I was wearing black, so only I knew.

A voice recording my dad left on my machine the week before he died, in 2003, 17 days after I got married.
What is your screensaver?
Claudia [Winkleman] and my Strictly producer who had four spray tans between them in Blackpool. Claudia sent it to me and said, “Do you think I’ve gone a bit too far this time?” It makes me splutter every time I see it.

On a motorway three years ago. An HGV hadn’t seen me and pulled out. My father-in-law’s a truck driver and he said black cars are not very visible. I don’t drive them any more.
What is the most important lesson life has taught you?
Life is a mirror and you get back what you give out.
Tell us a joke
What do you call a husband and wife fishing together? Rod and Annette.
My kitchen is … part of my living room. It’s quite big, but feels small because of all the stuff I have in there. I keep my spices in test tubes on a test-tube rack. I’ve got mini shelves on stilts so I can get more in, underneath and on top. I collect jam jars for storing stuff: leftovers, because I always cook more than I need; dry goods that I buy in bulk and decant … The kitchen is where I spend a lot of my time – my favourite weekends are based around my kitchen. I have an island in the middle that lets me prep while looking out of the window into the garden.
My favourite kitchen tool is … my chef’s knife. I got it when I enrolled at chef’s school when I was 17. It’s got my name on it. It’s my dearest possession.
My storecupboard staple is … dried chillies: scotch bonnet, chipotle, guajillo, piquin … I love the different heats and flavours. I use chipotle chillies in my cowboy-style baked beans for the smokiness; habaneros for heat in a slow beef short-rib recipe to go with waffles. Ancho or guajillo give a rich and fruity chocolatey flavour in my beef brisket chilli for nachos.
When I’m starving I … always have, without ever deviating, good cheese, quince jam and pickled onions. I sometimes add things to that, but always those things.
My culinary inspiration is … street food. If you’re cooking street food, you don’t have lots of stuff, or space. So you tend to focus on two or three things and do them extremely well. It’s very specialised, very focused: the best pad thai, the best cheeseburger …
My best-kept kitchen secret is … I use coffee all the time in food. Making stock usually involves roasting meat or veg, then boiling it in water, and straining it – which is exactly how you make coffee. So coffee is actually a stock and it can be used as one. I made a chilli a couple days ago with beef cheeks, soaking the chillies in coffee first.
When I’m invited to dinner I always take … a smile. I love cooking with friends, especially outdoors. I go surfing a fair bit and afterwards I love being round friends, cooking. I detest dinner parties – the idea of one person slaving all day over a showoff meal, then everyone turning up just to eat. I think food is about love, and there is happiness and love to be had when you’re all involved.
Everything tastes better with … fresh air. Food tastes better out in the open. When you drink wine, you suck air in while you drink it, which makes it taste the way it does. So it’s physically, as well as emotionally, true.
When I go shopping I … tend to be led by what’s in front of me. I go to my butcher or fishmonger, then shop around whatever hero ingredient I get.
For dinner tonight … I’m making blue corn tacos with beef cheek and queso fresco. With a glass of malbec.
I wish there were more of us. When I became a vegan at 19, my meat-eating parents worried my already fraught relationship with food was deteriorating. Family meals became stressful, eating out was a problem; I felt like a burden. But the more articles I read, and the more recipes I tried, the more my relationship with food began to heal.
In recent years, I’ve found being vegan makes romantic relationships difficult. Sitting across from a partner while he chowed down on an animal carcass didn’t get me going. Eating meat is not a deal-breaker for me – considering I know only one vegan man (a former teacher), this would be ridiculous – but in past relationships it has gnawed at me. It’s a constant reminder that we see the world in different ways.
There’s a loneliness to being vegan, to facing the fact that most people do not share your perspective, and will probably feel affronted if a discussion arises. Do you think I’m self-righteous? Preachy? Oversensitive? Overprivileged? The common stereotype is that everyone knows if you’re a vegan because you don’t shut up about it, and this still makes me anxious. Am I talking about it too much? Am I that girl? I’m not silently judging you for the choices you make, so please don’t do the same about me. I’m always happy to discuss the topic, and hope to encourage some change or understanding.
Ultimately, veganism is a philosophy that permeates every strand of my being. It is a part of my identity, so yes, it probably will come up in conversation. Just don’t ask me where I get my protein.

I have a bad habit of not telling writers I admire them until it’s too late. The only time I saw Nora Ephron in person was when I spotted her at a party in New York in 2010. “Oh wow, look there’s the woman who wrote your favourite collection of journalism, Crazy Salad, your favourite novel, Heartburn, and one of your favourite movies, When Harry Met Sally,” I vaguely thought to myself. “Should I say something to her? I could tell her how her writing taught me that being funny is a great way to make people listen. How writing the way you think, as opposed to relying on established formulae and cliche, is the way you carve out a writing voice. How she is always her own heroine and never the victim, which is probably the most valuable and inspiring thing of all. Nah, that might be a bit embarrassing. I’ll just try to interview her at some point and tell her then. No rush! Good plan, Freeman.” And of course, within two years she was dead, and a fat load of good it does her now, me sitting here mooning over her.
Which brings me to AA Gill. Now I was not close to Gill. In fact, I could probably count the number of chats we had on two hands with fingers to spare. But I was always pleased to see him, which is not, to be frank, something you can say of many journalists as well known as he is. In his writing and in person, he made everything seem funny and interesting: how many people can do that? So each time I saw him, and many times when I didn’t, I’d think, “I really ought to seek him out more, you know. He’s always so kind to me, and I should reciprocate in my own small way by telling him how much his writing has thrilled me since I was a teenager, with its fearless uniqueness and shameless silliness and courageous seriousness. I should tell him how much I love seeing him with his partner Nicola Formby, because it’s so heartening to see two people who have been together for decades still so palpably red hot for one another. And finally, I should say how much I love his dandified fashion sense, because it’s just brilliant to see a straight man take such unhesitating delight in camp. But hey, no rush! Maybe I’ll bump into him next month, or whatever.” And we all know how that turned out.
Successful writers are not known for their lack of ego, and Gill, I think it’s fair to say, knew how brilliant he was. But did he know how inspiring he was for the rest of us? I don’t know if he did, and now I never will. To read articles that combined archness with sincerity and never sacrificed substance; to see that he never – not once – filed a half-arsed that’ll-do piece, not even when he was on his actual deathbed: how could that not inspire? But if I was dazzled by Gill as a teenager, I am even more so after working in journalism for 16 years. The sheer strength of bloody will required to stay so original and curious for decades is what it takes to be a great writer, and is why so few of us are.
I could cite any number of his articles as favourites: his hilarious takedown of the pretentious Paris restaurant L’Ami Louis; his reportage with migrants marching desperately through the Balkans; his extraordinary final cover story, which managed to both damn the NHS and celebrate it. But his best work was probably his autobiography, Pour Me, which captured how silly, scary, monumental and ephemeral life is. Gill’s writing was never one note, which is why he was so suited to writing about life itself.
You don’t have to agree with everything a writer writes to be thrilled by them. Within an hour of his death being announced, I saw snarks on social media about how Gill had written things that offended some people and how therefore they had never liked him, the end. Oh well, their loss: outrage, despite popular opinion today, is not the be-all and end-all response. To dismiss a writer’s entire output because he occasionally offends you is like saying you hate a movie because you found the plot disagreeable – and there is a lot more to Manhattan than just Woody Allen dating a schoolgirl.
What great writers teach you is not just a new way of framing the world, but to be bold in your framing. They make you see the world the way they see it and, in doing so, show you how to find your own voice. A lot of my friends learn this lesson from pop music, which is why they felt so bereft at the beginning of the year about the death of David Bowie. I learn it from writers, which is why I feel so sad at the end of this year about Gill. But I also learn it from Melissa Bank, Helen Fielding, Edward St Aubyn, Joan Didion, Clive James, Marina Hyde and Curtis Sittenfeld, all of whom are, happily, still alive, and all of whom have written books and sentences that sing in my head daily. And having learned my lesson enough times now, I have told them before it’s too late.
I used to be unwilling to embrace change. That changed with Helen’s death
When I turned 30, in 2011, I envisioned my sexual experience eventually reaching a terminus, like a monorail gliding to a stop. I would disembark, find myself face-to-face with another human being, and there we would remain in our permanent station in life: the future.
I was single and straight. I had not chosen to be single, but love is rare and frequently unreciprocated. Without love, I saw no reason to form a permanent attachment to any particular place. My friends expressed a religious belief that it would arrive for me one day, as if love were something the universe owed to each of us, which no human could escape.
I had known love but, having known it, I knew how powerless I was to instigate it or ensure its duration. I knew that it did not arrive for everyone, and as I got older I began to worry it would not arrive for me.
On a Monday in April 2012, I stood in line at JFK airport to board a plane to California. I had decided to visit San Francisco because my desires and my reality had diverged beyond the point of reconciliation. I wanted to picture a different future, one aligned with the freedom of my present, and in those years San Francisco was where the future was going to be figured out, or at least it was the city designated for people who still believed in free love. They gave their choices names and they conceived of their actions as social movements. They saw in new technology an opportunity to refashion society, including ideas about sexuality.
By 2012, the young people who came to San Francisco were neither dropouts nor misfits. They were children who had grown up eating sugar-free cereal, swaddled in polar fleece jackets made from recycled plastic bottles. They had studied abroad, knew their favourite kinds of sashimi and were friends with their parents. Unlike their parents, they commuted to the suburbs and lived in the cities. As they arrived, the cities reshaped to receive their disposable income.
In San Francisco, the young people went to coffee shops where the production of espresso was ritualised to resemble a historic re-enactment of the hardships of 19th-century pioneer life. Nobody smoked cigarettes. They honed their bodies with the aim of either perfect homeostasis or eternal life. They ate red meat only once a month, to time their consumption of iron with the end of their menstrual cycles. They started companies whose names referenced fantasy fiction. They were adults, but they could seem like children. Their sex lives were impossible to fathom, because they seemed never to have lived in darkness. They had grown up observing foreign wars, economic inequality and ecological catastrophe, crises that they earnestly discussed on their digital feeds, but avoided internalising as despair.
I’m not saying Elizabeth was all of these things, but she described herself as an optimist. Elizabeth had a membership at a rock-climbing gym; she meditated and practised yoga. She organised hot-air balloon rides and weekend trips. She worked long, punishing hours, but had the energy to stay up all night at weekends, go on cycling excursions or attend silent retreats. A friend of mine had met her at a circus arts class and suggested I meet her.
Elizabeth had moved to San Francisco after college. Her boyfriend had moved to the south to go to medical school. No matter how much she loved him, or how much her mother, an infertility specialist, urged her to have children as a young woman, she was not yet ready to start a family. She had a job offer as a consultant at an economics firm. So, in 2010, when she was 22, she moved west and they broke up.
Elizabeth had never before lived in a city. She knew the suburbs in Virginia where she had grown up, and the small New England town where she had attended college. She arrived in San Francisco and made friends, some through internet dating.
She met Wes one night in late 2010, when he accompanied one of her co-workers to a boardgame party at her house. For their first date, they attended Nerd Night at a local bar. They watched a lecture about the future of teledildonics. On the walk home, they kissed. Then Wes, with the transparency he thought of as mature and fair, gave a speech of pre-emptive relationship indemnity. He was still getting over his last girlfriend, he said. He did not want to be in a relationship. Elizabeth tried not to roll her eyes – it was the first date! They said goodnight and parted ways.
Wes had grown up in San Francisco, studied computer science at Harvard and returned west after graduation to work at Google. Somewhere along the upward incline of his precocious youth, he had skipped a grade and was still only 21, tall and handsome.
Wes’s previous serious relationship, the one before he met Elizabeth, had ended during his senior year of college. At the time he met Elizabeth, the discovery of how much he liked casual sex was still new to him.
Still, Elizabeth and Wes lived near each other. They began meeting once a week for drinks, dates and sleeping over, always with a show of nonchalance. Given the choice, Elizabeth would have wanted a more serious commitment. She was only 23, but she had one reaction to Wes’s lack of interest in their relationship: he was acting like a baby. Fine, she decided. She would also see other people.
A few weeks later, she met Brian, a graduate of Stanford who also worked in tech. Soon Elizabeth had two non-boyfriends. Neither relationship had the expectation of exclusivity, or any defined path into the future. She kept the two separate and never saw the men together. They balanced each other, one providing security against the possible failure of the other.
One day in May 2011, six months after they met, Elizabeth introduced Wes to psilocybin mushrooms. The trip shifted their relationship. They still did not use the word “love”, but they now acknowledged what they referred to as “emotional involvement”.
Elizabeth was hired at Google. They took the bus to its Mountain View complex and ate in the cafeteria together. When they went for dinner with Wes’s family, Elizabeth was presented as a friend.
Elizabeth did not describe what she was doing – having sex with two men on a regular basis over an extended period of time, with the occasional extra-relationship dalliance besides – as polyamory. The word had cultural connotations for her, of swinging married people or creepy old men.
Although, like most people her age, she had friends whose partnerships allowed for sex with others, those friends tended to use the term “open relationship”, which was somehow less infused with the stigma of intentional weirdness, and did not amount to a proclamation of sexual identity.
Still, whatever accidental arrangement she had created, by the end of that year the lack of sexual boundaries was causing Elizabeth no small amount of anxiety. Wes’s crushes from high school were resurfacing. Women on the OkCupid dating site were probably sending him winky emoticons. To allay her growing insecurity, she turned to self-help and read The Ethical Slut: A Practical Guide To Polyamory, Open Relationships & Other Adventures, Sex At Dawn, by Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá, and Tristan Taormino’s Opening Up.
These books convinced Elizabeth that monogamy was a choice, not a given. It began to take on the cast of an unreasonable expectation, best suited to people who disliked experimentation: people not like her.
For almost a year, Elizabeth and Wes avoided naming the terms of their relationship. They celebrated the last night of 2011 with friends, and before midnight, because she wanted to say it while still relatively sober, Elizabeth told Wes she loved him. He loved her, too, but he still wanted sexual freedom. She had already decided she wanted it, too.
They agreed that they would think of themselves as a couple from now on, instead of two single people who slept together, but they would still not be monogamous. Now they had to figure out how to manage the logistics. Elizabeth compiled a shared Google doc that was to become the foundation of their research – a syllabus of recommended reading, places to attend discussion groups and sex parties open to the public. They went to a party at a sex club and had sex surrounded by onlookers. They returned another night, for an open-relationship discussion group, but most of the attendees were in their late 30s and were either married and “frisky” or desperate to save their failing marriages.
Elizabeth and Wes felt they could draw upon certain ideas of the older polyamorists, but had to do a lot of the thinking on their own. After their research, they began to draw up rules.
The first held that, on any given night, one could call the other and say, “Will you please come home?” There was a shared understanding that each of them was the most important person in the other’s life. The second rule was about disclosure: if one of them suspected he or she might sleep with another person, the premonition should be disclosed. They agreed to discuss each other’s crushes. If a sexual encounter happened spontaneously, the event should be disclosed soon afterwards. They would use condoms with their other partners.
Despite making rules, they would aim to fail. It was a concept they borrowed from computer security: if an unplanned event occurs, the default is to act first, then worry about formulating responses for the next time.
Early in 2012, Brian left the country for three months. In the absence of her second partner, Elizabeth felt an imbalance. Wes was still dating other people and she felt vulnerable. She was also coming to terms with what had been a growing crush on someone else. His name was Chris. He happened to be Wes’s best friend.
Wes said he wouldn’t mind if Elizabeth and Chris started to sleep together. Elizabeth, upset, asked how he could possibly care about her and want her to sleep with his best friend. They worked it out.
Chris is a tall man with a sweet smile and a shy affect. His parents had met at a commune in Santa Barbara in the early 1980s, so the example he had was one of youthful adventure that would eventually settle into conformity. He met Wes at Google, where they both started working in 2010.
Chris and Wes became friends around the time Wes met Elizabeth. Compared with them, Chris had a more introspective personality. He was more careful about taking risks when it came to things such as drugs and relationships.
By the end of 2011, the three regularly socialised as a group outside work. Soon after, Chris and Elizabeth would also hang out by themselves. Chris knew that his new friends were in an open relationship, but at first he saw his own role as a mutual confidant, with a much closer relationship to his male counterpart.
One night, Chris accompanied Elizabeth and Wes to a queer dance party. They all danced together, dancing that evolved seamlessly to kissing on the dance floor. Chris enjoyed it, but felt a little bit like the third wheel. His friends were on MDMA and he was not. Elizabeth and Wes had planned a foursome with another couple later that night, so Chris ended up going home alone.
It became an unspoken understanding that if the three of them went out dancing, they would probably end up kissing together. This was true for a whole group of friends who began to coalesce at this time around Wes and Elizabeth, who began to be sought after as gurus by other couples who had considered opening their relationships. The shared Google doc soon had multiple subscribers.
Chris asked Wes whether he really did not mind if he and Elizabeth occasionally slept together. Wes said he didn’t. Then Chris brought up another idea: what about the three of them together, he asked carefully. Or just the two men?
Chris described himself as “mostly straight but every once in a while…” Wes happened to be one of the men to whom Chris was attracted. Wes, meanwhile, suspected that he was not at all gay, although in the spirit of the times he was having trouble making such a closed-minded declaration. He told Chris he needed to think about it.
The two men were affectionate with each other, even kissing hello or goodbye, but Chris was surprisingly troubled by his unreturned desire for Wes.
I first met Chris, Elizabeth, and Wes in late May 2012, when their experiment was just a few months old. I was seven years older than Elizabeth and Chris, eight older than Wes. I envied the openness with which they shared their attractions. They did not proceed recklessly. They drew up ethical codes to protect their relationships. Elizabeth and Wes seemed to plunge forward through life without fear. I saw in Chris a little more hesitation.
They were not bothered, as I was, by the evidence that nonmonogamous arrangements had been rejected by the last generation of straight people who had tried them. I looked at the experiments of the 60s and 70s, and felt they had taught us that communes and other alternative arrangements that celebrated sexual freedom generally ended in jealousy and hurt feelings. We obedient children of the 80s and 90s saw the failures of the counterculture, and held ourselves in thrall to drug laws, health insurance, student loan payments, internships, condoms, skin protection factors, antidepressants, designated smoking areas, politically correct language, child safety locks, gym memberships, cancer screenings and career advancement. We had a nuanced understanding of risk.
When it came to sex, I thought we had it much better than previous generations. We knew better than to move into rural communes or force one’s wife to sleep with another man to overcome her cultural programming. We had more access to birth control, and knew more about our bodies. We had a vast selection of vibrators sold in woman-friendly retail environments. We had rape crisis centres, legal abortion and over-the-counter emergency contraception.
What my married parents imparted as the lessons from the 60s was that it was fine to have as much casual (“safe”) sex as we wanted as late-stage teenagers and young adults, and fine secretly to “experiment” with the more benign and least addictive drugs (although no teacher or relative ever openly recommended it), but eventually we would grow up and settle into the nuclear families we saw on television. Some of us would be gay and that would be fine. Many of these families would fall apart, but we did not consider divorce a structural failure of an institution, but a set of personal problems.
Among my mostly secular group of friends, the ceremonies of marriage and death were the only ritual sacraments left. I believed in the mystique of commitment. Could I think of myself as an adult if I never married? Would my married friends become distant and remote? Elizabeth, Wes and Chris believed there were still primary choices to make about sexuality. I wasn’t the only one who kept thinking about the warnings of people who had observed the 60s and felt hesitation. There was a phrase being thrown around the Bay Area only half-jokingly: “responsible hedonism”.
In the spring of 2012, Elizabeth would spend most nights with Wes and the occasional night with Chris or someone else. The three friends would see each other at work, too. When their relationships evolved, the shifts tended to happen not in slow increments, but with sudden tectonic upheavals, usually during out-of-town retreats that served as emotional crucibles.
Wes and Elizabeth’s relationship had acquired an acceleration, a momentum based on mutual daring. In the way that some couples might spend their energy systematically eating at new restaurants, Elizabeth and Wes went to sex parties. Elizabeth attended two porn shoots, one of them with Wes, the other with a woman who had become another long-term sexual partner. In June 2013, Wes left Google to start his own company. Between ending one job and beginning the other, he travelled around Europe. Elizabeth met him in Amsterdam, where they hired a prostitute.
In May 2013, Elizabeth took a work trip to Tokyo. Chris decided to go with her and play “house husband”. For the first time, they honestly discussed Chris’s understanding of Wes, of how, in Chris’s hopes and expectations, he had fallen in love – “filled in the dots with his own lines”, as Elizabeth put it. She left the conversation feeling they finally understood their differences, but also felt Chris’s romantic attraction to her break.
As untraditional as Wes and Elizabeth’s relationship was, it had started to look as if it was heading toward the traditional happy ending. They discussed moving in together, and finally did so in late 2013. The decision carried less weight with the knowledge that, at least a few times a month, one of them would be spending the night at someone else’s place. The lingering question for both was what would happen should one of them fall in love with someone else. They even discussed this likelihood with an older married couple, a couple in their late 30s who had been married for years. The man told them a story of how in the course of their open marriage, his wife had truly fallen for another person. He called it a “crisis episode”. They decided together that they were what they called “life journey partners” – a designation that sounded very hokey, but that was meant to indicate, Wes said, that “there’s being in love, and there’s being in love and wanting to spend the rest of your life with someone”. There would be times when a person had to compromise.
In August 2014, Elizabeth and Wes got engaged at the Burning Man festival. In August 2015, I attended their wedding in Black Rock City. To the tune of Somewhere Over The Rainbow played on an electric piano, Wes and Elizabeth, he in a white, button-down shirt and black trousers, she in a white dress, both with colourful face paint around their eyes, processed to an altar decorated with pink fabric flowers and tasselled fringe. Relatives delivered loving statements. Wes’s godfather recited a Druid prayer. We lit sparklers and held them skyward as the sun set, forming a ring of light. The drone of a didgeridoo obscured the couple’s quiet murmuring.
“By the power invested in me by the internet, you are now married,” said the officiant, Wes’s uncle. “You can kiss each other and other people.”
Chris and Elizabeth threw their first sex party in the fall of 2012. In early 2015, I went to the fourth iteration, Thunderwear IV, in a rented loft. A black-and-white portrait of Elizabeth lifting one of her legs up over her head in a full split and penetrating herself with a dildo hung over the room. She had installed a stripper pole.
The invitation had laid out the party’s rules in a charter, to which every invitee had to agree:
2 Consent is required. And sexy. If you wanna do something, ask first. Bonus points for enthusiastic consent.
3 This is a party. Parties are fun! You don’t have to do anything you don’t wanna do. If you don’t wanna, say “no thanks”.
4 This is a party. Have fun! White ribbon means: ask to feed me (remember, you can say no). Red ribbon means: ask me for a kiss (on the cheek… at first, at least).
5 Relationship conversation with your partner recommended before you start partying.
There was one final rule: no glitter, at the request of the venue.
The party started calmly, with drinking and talking. I stood and talked with one of the two other people over 30. Elizabeth, ever organised, told me she had taken out liability insurance for the stripper pole.
The friends had arranged to begin the evening with an amateur burlesque show. We watched a slightly botched acrobatic routine to Rihanna’s song Jump. The next woman performed a pirate-themed striptease that concluded with her taping a pair of red cups to her breasts, filling them with Malibu, orange juice and coconut milk, and letting people drink from them with straws. Then, to Rihanna’s Birthday Cake, came a striptease that ended with the performer smearing herself all over with cake.
After the show, I walked into the massive slate-gray bathroom with its Jacuzzi and had a conversation with a couple about the dream of one day living in a backyard casita in Oakland with a composting toilet. I wandered back to the loft, where couples and threesomes had begun to pair off on couches. Nearby was a wheel of fortune that could be spun for instructions. After several conversations that felt like job interviews, I ended up taking turns spinning the wheel with a man. I did so with a slightly exhausted determination to get the show on the road. He was a bit younger. We spun the wheel, awkwardly obeying instructions to feed each other strawberries and kiss.
Then we went into the second room to do whip-its. I had never done a whip-it. My new friend explained how it worked: screw a small canister of nitrous oxide on to a stainless-steel whipped-cream maker. Exhale deeply, then inhale while depressing the handle of the machine, filling your lungs with nitrous oxide instead of oxygen. This produces a one- or two-minute high. Deprived of oxygen, the mind dissolves; physical sensation becomes acute, a goofy giddiness sets in. Whip-its are good for a sex party, because they do not impair sexual function and can heighten physical sensation, although I was advised not to do too many.
On my first whip-it, the man I had met lightly touched my arm, the feeling of his hands producing warmth and electricity while my vision broke into geometric patterns. During his turn, he asked that I kiss him. We made out for a while, doing the occasional whip-it. I felt airy and happy. We stood up with our hands against the wall and took turns smacking each other with a riding crop. Around us, groups of people lay together on beds and couches, or stood making out in corners. On a couch, a man lay across the laps of his friends, who formed a spanking train. I sat with Elizabeth and took a whip-it, after which she massaged my head while a man lightly shocked me with an electrified wand.
The after-party was at the apartment of one of Elizabeth’s partners, a man with whom she had exchanged I-love-yous. I had overheard a conversation between her and Wes before she left, where she had asked Wes if he would let her go on her own. It was a conversation that was difficult to listen to. I believed Wes when he cheerfully assented, but I also knew my own feelings would have been hurt. Chris was there, too, with his now steady girlfriend.
Elizabeth had slyly slipped me a condom, but I didn’t have sex. My then boyfriend in New York had not wanted me to attend the party at all. I was still thinking of myself as just a visitor, or rather neither here nor there, someone undertaking an abstract inquiry, but not yet with true intention. I regretted having been shy in my making out earlier at the sex party, that I had spent the night with one person instead of joining the cuddle puddle coalesced on the satin-sheeted bed opposite.
I wished I had other chances for this degree of experimentation, and wondered what it would feel like to be not a visitor to this scene, but a part of it. It had been easier for me to relax, because most of the people in the room had been strangers. Now I sat in a penthouse with a group of sleepy partygoers. We chatted and looked at the view. In the background was the sound of whip-its, of orgasms, of water falling from a shower into a porcelain tub.

This has never been a good season for animals, but two or three centuries ago it was rather worse. Christmas dinner was preceded by artisanal cruelty in all its terrible variety. Poultry, for instance: the less they ran or fluttered about, the fatter they got, so geese would be nailed by their webbed feet to the floor, while chickens and game birds were confined to windowless cells, sometimes after their keeper had taken the extra precaution of blinding them or cutting off their legs.
Mammals were, literally, a tougher proposition. Popular belief said that meat was best tenderised while it was still alive, so calves and pigs were whipped to death with knotted ropes, and bulls killed only after dogs had baited them. Succulent Dorset lambs, according to the historian Keith Thomas, arrived at the Christmas tables of the Georgian gentry only after a lengthy imprisonment in “dark little cabins”.
A desire for paler meat led to longer deaths. A calf’s executioner, having cut the animal at the neck, would let it bleed for a while and then staunch the wound for a day to let death come slowly. As for turkeys, the custom was to snip a vein inside their mouths and hang them upside down, so that their blood dripped out little by little. The upside-down position remains a constant of turkey slaughter, though the process today is industrial, possibly less painful and necessarily quicker.
Somewhere around 10 million of the birds will be eaten this Christmas in Britain, ending their brief lives suspended by their legs from a production line that plunges them head-first into the electrified stunning baths, and then to the slaughterhouse workers who slash open their carotid arteries. One stroke usually does it.
It would be wrong to think of our unease as new. Abstinence from meat has been a feature of Hinduism and its various offshoots in the east for perhaps 3,000 years. Somewhat later in Europe, the philosopher Pythagoras refused meat because he believed that souls could migrate between animals and human beings; eating animal flesh was therefore no better than cannibalism.
In England, the foundations of modern vegetarianism were laid in 1683, when a Christian mystic and dietary reformer, Thomas Tryon, published a remarkably modern-sounding book, The Way to Health, Long Life and Happiness, that asked its readers to consider: “How shall they but bestial grow, / That thus to feed on beasts are willing? / Or why should they a long life know, / Who daily practice KILLING?” For the poet Alexander Pope, 30 years later, nothing could be “more shocking or horrid” than the prospect of a kitchen “covered with blood and filled with the cries of creatures expiring in tortures”.
Nevertheless, our unease did nothing to stop us. More and more animal flesh was eaten. Bread and cheese kept the poor alive in 18th-century England, but the middle and upper classes stuffed themselves with roasts, steaks and chops – a morning, noon and night gluttony that turned England into the most carnivorous country in Europe and left many among its wealthier population corpulent and ill. In his excellent history of vegetarianism, The Heretic’s Feast, Colin Spencer suggests that the consequent revulsion against the obese and the drunk, slobbering under their cockeyed wigs, made the idea of a strict vegetable and water diet almost fashionable.
The “almost” is important. People such as Benjamin Franklin who took it up usually put it down again, seeing it as a cure, the equivalent of two weeks’ rehab in the Priory, rather than a lifetime commitment. But the arguments for abstinence were developing. Percy Bysshe Shelley, who was probably the cause’s most celebrated advocate until George Bernard Shaw and Mahatma Gandhi came along, added economic efficiency to a list that already included human wellbeing and the humane treatment of animals.
“The quantity of nutritious vegetable matter consumed in fattening the carcass of an ox would afford 10 times the sustenance [to people],” the poet wrote in 1812, publicising a proposition that is increasingly relevant to a world in which the process known as meatification turns traditionally plant-eating societies into new markets for hamburgers and replaces rain forests with cattle ranches.
When the Vegetarian Society was founded in 1847, the anti-meat cause took the name we now know it by and began to think of itself as a movement. At its first annual general meeting in Manchester, then the world’s most radical city, 31 of its members recorded a lifelong abstinence from “flesh food”, while another 12 said they hadn’t touched it for 30 to 40 years. The banquet that followed included two kinds of omelette, four kinds of fritter and plum pudding. The toasts were drunk in water.
Punch magazine thought the whole affair absurd, and doubted the banquet’s “mixture of messes” could promote health. A mainstream viewpoint had been fixed. Hostile caricature followed English vegetarianism wherever it went over the following 150 years, so much so that London’s most popular vegetarian restaurant in the 1970s boldly went by the name Cranks. I ate at its plain wood tables regularly.
All that has changed, at least in London, where, according to the British Social Attitudes survey, a quarter of British vegetarians live. The sandwich chain Pret a Manger opened a vegetarian branch this year and plans a second. Vegetarian restaurants now go by names such as Vanilla Black. Jane Muir, the owner of Mildreds, was determined on a title that carried no suggestions of plain living or Mother Earth, and named her restaurants after a favourite American film noir, Mildred Pierce, with Joan Crawford as the eponymous heroine.
Not everyone who eats there is a vegetarian, but like many similar places its success has been underpinned by dietary groups that vegetarianism has helped create. First, the growing number of vegans drawn to the logic of abstaining from animal products as well as animals – because the dairy industry depends on the slaughter of cattle and at the same time contributes to the methane emissions of cattle overall, which are estimated to make up of 18% of greenhouses gases.
Second, the “meat reducers” – the people (often men over 60) who’ve been told by their doctors, partners and children to eat less of it, or reached the decision to live longer on no other advice but their own. Both groups are overwhelmingly middle class. Like obesity, unrestrained meat consumption (fry-ups, burgers, kebab wraps) has changed sides, and now suggests poverty rather than wealth.
Am I a vegetarian? Of course – anyone with half an imagination must be. The question really is: how often am I a vegetarian? Not so long ago I could look over the hedge into the plaintive eyes of a young calf, resolve to go meatless and then order a steak pie from the butcher an hour or two later. That has changed. A day or two would now be needed to separate the two events, and in any case the steak pies have become rather few. We hardly ever cook meat at home, but I’m omnivorous as the guest of others. A good life and a humane death: these considerations of provenance influence the decision of which animals’ flesh to buy, but the charge of hypocrisy hangs over them.
Last Christmas we had a nut roast – an item I’d be delighted never to see again. This Christmas, to my surprise, the current vegetarian in chief has suggested fillet steaks and dauphinoise potatoes. To be looked forward to: Christmas comes but once a year, and with it an extra portion of cruelty.
I usually do three recipes for this column, but I got a bit overexcited in the run-up to Christmas, so this week I’ve squeezed in four, all of them baked, charred or roasted for extra comfort. (And anyway, what kind of food writer would I be if I didn’t provide a recipe for sprouts at this time of year?) So, happy planning, cooking and feasting.
Serve as a standalone meal, perhaps with a crisp green salad, or as an side for roast chicken. The stuffing mix also works in a chicken and even baked on its own. Serves six.
3 tbsp olive oil
1 onion, peeled and roughly chopped 
250g cooking chorizo, cut into 1cm dice
1 green pepper, deseeded and chopped into 1cm pieces
1 large garlic clove, peeled and crushed
1 tsp smoked paprika
Salt and black pepper
100g slice sourdough (crust left on)
50g lightly toasted flaked almonds
20g parsley leaves, roughly chopped
20g basil leaves, roughly chopped
100g manchego, cut into 1cm pieces
1 egg, lightly whisked
6 romano peppers
150ml chicken stock
Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Heat two tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan on a medium-high flame, then fry the onion for seven to eight minutes, stirring often, until soft and caramelised. Add the chorizo, green pepper, garlic, paprika, three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper, and fry for seven minutes, stirring every once in a while, until the chorizo is cooked, then leave to cool a little.
Put the sourdough in a food processor and blitz for a minute, to turn it into rough crumbs (the largest pieces should be about 1cm). Tip into a large bowl with the chorizo mixture, almonds, herbs, manchego and egg, and mix well.
Use a small knife to cut a long, narrow V down the centre of each pepper, 2cm wide at the stalk and narrowing down towards the tip. Remove the seeds, then push the stuffing into the peppers, forcing it deep inside. Arrange the peppers on a 20cm x 30cm high-sided baking tray, drizzle with the remaining oil, and season with an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper. Pour the stock over and around the peppers, then roast for 20 minutes, until the filling has browned. Baste the peppers, cover with foil and cook for a final 15 minutes, until the peppers are soft. Serve hot.
This is so rich and comforting that it can act as a meal in itself, maybe with some wilted spinach; thanks to the egg whites, though, the mash is also light and fluffy enough to serve alongside a steak, say. If you don’t have ramekins, cook it in one 20cm x 25cm baking dish. Serves eight as a side dish, or four as a main course.
1.2 kg desiree potatoes
130ml double cream
100g unsalted butter, 30g melted, for brushing
Salt
2 tbsp olive oil
300g button mushrooms, chopped
2 tbsp thyme leaves
3 garlic cloves, crushed
10g dried porcini, soaked in 300ml boiling water for 30 minutes
2 eggs, yolks and whites separated
120g mature cheddar, coarsely grated
Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Put the potatoes on a baking tray and roast for an hour or so, until cooked through. Leave to cool a little, then cut in half and scoop out the flesh with a spoon (you’ll get about 650g). Put the flesh in a bowl with the cream, 70g butter and a teaspoon of salt, mash and set aside.
Turn down the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Heat the oil in a large saute pan on a high flame, then fry the mushrooms, thyme and garlic for 10 minutes, stirring a few times, until browned. Strain the porcini through a J-cloth directly into the pan, to remove any grit, then stir in rehydrated mushrooms and a third of a teaspoon of salt, and cook for three to four minutes more, until only about 60ml of liquid is left in the pan. Spoon the mix into a food processor and blitz to a coarse paste.
Stir the egg yolks into the potato mix until combined. In a separate large, clean bowl, whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks, then gently fold into the potato.
Brush the insides of eight ramekins (9-10cm wide x 5cm deep) with half the melted butter. Divide half the mashed potato between the ramekins, pressing it down slightly, then top with all the mushroom paste. Spoon the remaining mash on top, so it covers the mushrooms, and flatten a little. Brush with the remaining melted butter, sprinkle with the cheddar and bake for 25-30 minutes, until the potato has risen slightly and is golden brown on top. Rest for a minute or two, then serve.
Sprouts, like all cabbages, take very well to a little charring. Serves four to six.
50g fresh ginger
280g cream cheese
1 small garlic clove, crushed
Finely grated zest of 1 lime, plus 2 tsp lime juice
1 tbsp rice-wine vinegar
2½ tbsp groundnut oil 
Salt and black pepper
750g brussels sprouts, cut in half lengthways
½ tsp pink peppercorns, crushed with your fingers
½ tsp toasted sesame seeds
Start with the dressing. Peel and grate the ginger on a coarse grater, then push it through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl – you should end up with tablespoon and a half of ginger juice. Add the cream cheese, garlic, lime juice, vinegar, two tablespoons of groundnut oil, three tablespoons of water and a pinch of salt, then whisk until thick.
Put a large nonstick frying pan for which you have a lid on a high heat. Once it’s very hot, add the sprouts cut side down: you don’t want them to overlap, so you may need to cook them in batches. Cover and cook for four minutes, until blackened, then tip into a bowl.
Once all the sprouts are charred, mix them with the remaining half-tablespoon of oil, an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Spread some of the dressing on a platter and arrange the sprouts burnt side up on top. Dot the rest of the dressing over the sprouts, sprinkle with lime zest, pink peppercorns and sesame seeds, and serve.
Kabocha squash has a creamy, nutty texture that pairs perfectly with the sweet, sticky roasting juices here, but butternut will also work well. And you could use a chicken instead of guinea fowl, if need be: just adjust the cooking times to reflect the larger bird. Check if it’s cooked by piercing the thickest part of the leg with a skewer: if the juices run clear, you’re good to go. The longer you marinate the guinea fowl, the better: 24 hours, if you can, though overnight will do. Serves four.
5 sprigs fresh thyme
10 sage leaves, roughly shredded
Finely shaved skin of 1 orange
6 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed with the flat of a knife 
2 tsp chilli flakes
12 soft ready-to-eat prunes
2 red onions, peeled and quartered 
2 tbsp muscovado sugar
90ml pomegranate molasses
50ml dark soy sauce
150ml olive oil
Salt 
1 guinea fowl (about 950g), quartered
½ kabocha squash (about 700g), unpeeled and cut into 2cm-thick wedges
Put the first 10 ingredients in a large bowl with six tablespoons of olive oil and half a teaspoon of salt. Add the guinea fowl, toss to coat (as ever, your hands are the best tool for this), then cover with clingfilm and refrigerate for up to 24 hours.
To cook, heat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Add the squash to the guinea fowl bowl with the rest of the oil and half a teaspoon of salt. Toss to combine, then tip into a large (roughly 28cm x 34cm) high-sided roasting tray, making sure the bird is skin side up. Cover tightly with foil, roast for 10 minutes, then remove the foil, increase the temperature to 220C/425F/gas mark 7 and cook for 25-30 minutes more, basting a couple of times: you want everything covered in the sticky glaze. If the fowl is done before the squash is ready, lift it out and keep it warm while you give the squash a few minutes more. Leave to rest for a few minutes before serving.
• Yotam Ottolenghi is chef/patron of Ottolenghi and Nopi in London.
Michel Roux Jr, born into chef aristocracy and trained under his father, Albert, and his uncle Michel, has a sense of dynasty – its entitlements, its myopias, its burdens, its scars – that is palpable in almost all he says.
“I knew it was going to be interesting working for my father and uncle,” he once told the Financial Times. “It was more difficult for me than for other youngsters, because I had a point to prove.” 
It is fascinating as a psychological portrait made of food, a trompe l’oeil effect of the anxiety of privilege, bruised perfectionism carved into foie gras.
Yet the microscope is currently on the more prosaic matter of his books. Chastised by this newspaper last month for paying below the minimum wage, he released a statement on Thursday with the unforced revelation that he treats the service charge as “revenue”, that is to say, the 13% added to the bill does not go directly to the staff.
He said the next day that he intended to scrap the charge. But commenting broadly on the wage issue, he added three riders: the first, that he was no different from anyone else in the industry; the second that, in his own training in Paris in the 1970s, he slept on his grandmother’s couch and “never once looked at his payslip”; and the third: “The work conditions are unbelievable and the benefits of working at Le Gavroche and for the Roux family. But they are intangible. You can’t put a worth on it.”
Working conditions in the catering industry are harsh. At the bottom end, it’s low wages, zero-hours, interchangeability and precariousness. At the top end, there’s all of that, plus eye-boggling overwork, the kind of hours chefs will only talk about anonymously and in retrospect (a former pastry chef for Marco Pierre White once told me he’d lived for three years on four hours of sleep a night).
There is an amortised resentment, common to a lot of chefs aged over 50 (Roux is 56), exacting servitude from future generations who dare to want better conditions than they had.
Roux trained under maître patissier Henri Hellegouarch in Paris from 1976 to 1979 and, even coming from a culture that admits no whining, he calls this period “challenging”. He spent his military service cooking at the Elysée between Giscard d’Estaing and François Mitterrand.
Into this very recognisable trope – that money and leisure are not just insignificant but abhorrent to the grafter, the true poet – feeds another macho tributary: perfectionists have tantrums.
“Street angel, kitchen devil” is the winsome term for it, but it’s basically bullying and there are vanishingly few chefs of standing whom nobody has seen behave tyrannically to their staff.
Roux is not one of them. It would be astonishing if he were, but it does bear consideration, the medieval volatility of these workplaces which, coupled with the low pay, amount to serf-like conditions.
He is right about Le Gavroche: these underpaid chefs could undoubtedly all be replaced tomorrow by chefs who would bite his hand off to do a stage with him for free. Ambitious chefs routinely make pilgrimages to prestigious kitchens, working for nothing for a couple of months. These are not the ideal conditions to hone a strong sense of social justice and equal opportunity.
In 2013, Roux said on Andrew Neil’s This Week TV programme that young people, generally, needed to take whatever unpaid work experience they were offered.
It’s a worldview to pauperise a generation, while simultaneously expecting gratitude, but you can see how normal the idea would seem to a person bred in elite kitchens.
He is not without philanthropic interests and, in 2015, made a programme for Channel 4 about mentoring young disabled people into catering. Nor is he unworldly; when he left MasterChef in 2014, after six years, it was because they had fallen out over an endorsement deal that he had with a potato company.
The chef took over at Le Gavroche in 1991 and lost its third Michelin star two years later, to which he responded graciously: “Certainly, I would love three stars. I believe in the system and the recognition would be wonderful. But I am not cooking that style of food. There are dishes that are worthy of it but my style really doesn’t suit that status.”
Technically, the food is faultless; the atmosphere reverent; the decor like a grand theme park. Michelin never give details on why they’ve stripped a star. In London, people have said the cooking was so pristine that it lacked a sense of adventure, but his Parisian peers were mystified by the decision.
The typical price for a meal is £212 per head. On the matter of the service charge, Roux’s friends have argued that to hand the charge to staff would require radically higher prices.
“For me, tipping and service charge are two different things but by removing the service charge and incorporating it into the cost of the menu then it is clear, clean and unambiguous,” Roux said.
“And then if diners wish to leave a tip on top of that it is up to them. I think this is something we should do in the restaurant industry.
“It is not clear for the customer whether or not they should leave extra on the table or whether or not it is going to all the staff or how it is being distributed. I daresay some restaurateurs have been abusing that.”
It rings a bit tinny; spending a fortune is part of the point of Le Gavroche and it is a tough sell that waiters ought to subsidise the dining experience of people who have just swallowed almost a week’s minimum wage in three hours.
However, the nub of his defence – he’s just a person who “ballsed up” in an industry built on worse – is one with which most of his colleagues will sympathise.
Normal, regular shifts with talented but amenable, respectful head chefs are so unusual that you could count the restaurants on one hand.
It would take a scandal, not worse so much as of an entirely different nature, to land a blow on this reputation.
Most Christmas songs rely on bells and choirs, but what magic ingredient makes a classic?
Well, it depends on where you live. Christmas songs don’t travel all that well. All of the 10 most-streamed Christmas songs in north America are by north American artists. In the UK, aside from Mariah Carey and Michael Bublé, the top 10 are all British or Irish.
In 2015, the top three Christmas tracks streamed on Spotify in the UK were Mariah Carey’s All I Want for Christmas is You, Wham!’s Last Christmas and Fairytale of New York by the Pogues and Kirsty MacColl. It looks as if it will be the same three this year, too.
According to data from Radiomonitor, which tracks 738 radio stations in the UK, these three songs also topped the radio charts. By this measure, the Pogues claimed the No 1 spot. Taken together, these three songs were heard no fewer than 404 million times on the radio over the course of the Christmas period – from the start of November to the middle of January.
Radio does not always reflect what listeners pick and choose on Spotify. Slade’s Merry Xmas and East 17’s Stay Another Day, for example, are chosen far more often by radio producers than by Spotify users.
On Christmas Day itself, there’s little escape. Of the 200 most-played songs on Spotify on 25 December, 139 were festive numbers. But the mood is short-lived – within four days, only two songs make the list.
While beauty departments are stuffed, capon-like, with too many great present ideas, men are frequently sold short with faux vintage razor and bowl sets, or grooming products corralled incongruously into a mug. But in my experience men love a quality grooming gift, provided it’s not of the novelty variety (step away from the hilarious moustache care kits).
Clarins Men and Clinique For Men are reliable hits (the latter has a great-value sonic-cleansing gadget and three-step product set for £79 this year). But if you’ve been there, done that, do consider CO Bigelow, a solid, good-quality and traditionally packaged apothecary brand from New York. There are no duds, but Cold And Flu Soak (£22) and Chapped Hands Cleanser Soap Free (£16) are unusual and suitably special-looking.
Almost all men love Tom Ford’s Neroli Portofino, and I certainly agree with them; but in the same olfactory ballpark, and just as wonderful in its own way, is 4711, among the world’s oldest colognes and well over 100 quid cheaper at just £7.66. I love this, and am as happy to wear it myself as to sniff it on him indoors. That said, he’s hoping for Le Labo’s Santal 33, an admittedly gorgeous (and, at £115, extremely expensive) smoky, spicy, but not too macho scent that I can at least steal for myself.
For gadget lovers, the Philips OneBlade (£34.99) is excellent. It’s a razor/shaver hybrid that needs a new blade every four months and a battery recharge about once a week. It doesn’t shave as close as a blade, but is exceptionally gentle on sensitive skins, and close enough for men who don’t like to be as smooth as an egg (it also has trimming attachments for beards, ’taches and sideburns).
If he can’t be tempted to leave the basin, then Italian barbershop shaving cream Proraso (£5.95) usually goes down a storm. The old-fashioned metal tube looks great on the shelf, and men seem to love the rich, creamy formula. If your budget could stretch to it, you could pop it in a Herschel washbag (£25). Simple, nicely made and cool without being agonisingly so (a grandad would be as appreciative as a teen), these canvas travel pouches seem to sell out every Christmas, so do get a wiggle on if you’d like one.
All happy Christmases are the same, but all unhappy Christmases are unhappy after their own fashion. We can put up with the festive good cheer of the Cratchits in A Christmas Carol or Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy in Little Women, but what a discerning reader relishes is a really hellish Christmas. Writers know this perfectly well and have always revelled in Christmases gone badly wrong. What better occasion could there be for the release of long-suppressed resentment or anger or despair that make for satisfying drama?
The mismatch between merry pretensions and grim reality is often comic. No wonder that Bridget Jones’s Diary begins in the aftermath of one Christmas and heads towards a second, even worse, Christmas, in its last chapter. (Though no sooner has Bridget opened the damning maternal gift of a slow cooker for one, than Helen Fielding saves her from the family Christmas by having Mark Darcy appear to whisk her away.) In John Lanchester’s 2012 novel Capital, Christmas is the beginning of a hubristic descent from monied complacency for banker Roger Yount. It all begins when he finds that his Christmas bonus is a mere £30,000 (he had hoped for a million). Then his trophy wife, Arabella, walks out on him on Christmas Eve, forcing him to look after their two small children while the au pair is away. Arabella is not leaving him, you understand, just teaching him a lesson: she has absconded to a spa hotel (charged to his account) while he learns to appreciate her. Christmas for Roger means that the nanny agency is closed and no help is at hand.
The man who we thought was going to be the novel’s villain is condemned to an ordeal that humiliates but oddly humanises him. On Christmas morning, the two small boys are up by six and have ripped open their presents five minutes later. Infant Lego and bits of Brio litter the floor. Roger has to smash a racing car that won’t stop beeping. The instructions for assembling a remote-controlled robot utterly defeat him. He discovers that his sons’ eating habits are weirdly demanding. He discovers that they are clamorous rivals for his attention. And he discovers the horrors of toddler poo, much of which ends up on his expensive dressing gown. At this moment the new sofa ordered by his wife arrives at the front door.
Some of this must be based on Lanchester’s own experience of the levelling effects of childcare. (The narrator’s observation that Roger sits his restive children in front of the television “too soon”, not realising that if watched first thing in the morning it makes them “febrile and listless”, sounds like authorial worldly wisdom.) Even the materialistic Roger is half-appalled by the consumer frenzy that he and his wife have instilled in their progeny. Perhaps he might feel a tweak of sympathy for Edmund Gosse’s widower father as depicted in his classic study of a Victorian childhood, Father and Son. Gosse senior, a Protestant fundamentalist, is convinced that Christmas is unchristian – a feast “adapted from horrible heathen rites, and itself a soiled relic of the abominable Yule-Tide”: “He would denounce the horrors of Christmas until it almost made me blush to look at a holly-berry.”
Gosse’s father decrees that Christmas Day be treated as the same as any other day, and that “no difference whatever was to be made in our meals on that day”. The servants, however, would secretly make a Christmas pudding and take the eight-year-old Edmund down to the kitchen for a delicious slice of it. After he has eaten, he is tormented by his conscience and eventually bursts into his father’s study to confess. “Oh! Papa, Papa, I have eaten of flesh offered to idols!” Gosse père is outraged: he drags his son down to the kitchen, seizes the remains of the pudding and runs out to the dust heap. There “he flung the idolatrous confectionery on to the middle of the ashes, and then raked it deep down into the mass. The suddenness, the violence, the velocity of this extraordinary act made an impression on my memory which nothing will ever efface.”
This has many of the ingredients of comedy, but in fact it is terrible. Terrible too is Adrian Mole’s Christmas in the Midlands in the 1980s, but this is also comic. Adrian has invited the malodorous old Bert, and his companion Queenie, for Christmas Day. “My mother doesn’t know yet but I’m sure she won’t mind, we have got a big turkey.” His mother’s ghastly relatives, the Sugdens, turn up, while Adrian and his father carry in the obese Bert and Queenie. Then the Mole relatives arrive, meaning that at least Auntie Susan can entertain the company with anecdotes of life in prison while they await the meal. But where is that meal?
“I went up to the bathroom and found my mother crying and running the turkey under the hot tap. She said, ‘The bloody thing won’t thaw out, Adrian. What am I going to do?’ I said, ‘Just bung it in the oven.’ So she did.” The meal is four hours late, Adrian’s father sinks further into dumb inebriation and the Sugdens, it seems, will never go.
Drink is essential to the grim comedy of Christmas. In Jane Austen’s Emma the apparently charming but in fact thoroughly nasty young vicar, Mr Elton, plans to use Christmas festivities to pop the question to the novel’s eponymous heroine. We can see what’s coming, but she can’t. Opportunity knocks when he arranges to share a carriage with her on the way back from the Westons’ jolly Christmas party. There, as Emma observes, he has been “drinking too much of Mr Weston’s good wine”. She does not realise that he is priming himself for one of those Christmas declarations familiar to the viewers of TV soap operas. No sooner is the snugly upholstered carriage making its way through the dark, snowy Surrey lanes than Emma finds that he is “actually making violent love to her” (gentle readers can be reassured that this meant something different in 1815 from what it means now).
It is a terrible Christmas for Emma, but is it really so bad for the rest of us? Well, it can be. Research in the US shows that death rates are at their highest on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day (even though suicide rates are at their lowest in December). Deaths from “natural causes” peak at Christmas. The current NHS information bulletin “Keep safe at Christmas”, describing Yuletide health risks – traffic accidents, falls, alcohol poisoning – makes dispiriting reading: “Every year, about 1,000 people are injured by their Christmas tree, usually while fixing stars, lights or other decorations to the higher branches.” And yes, over the Christmas period there is a marked increase in the number of murders.
The writers of murder mysteries must have always known this in their bones. There is indeed a special subgenre of whodunits featuring Yuletide violence. Among recent surprise bestsellers have been Francis Duncan’s Murder for Christmas and J Jefferson Farjeon’s Mystery in White, A Christmas Crime Story, reissued books first published in 1949 and 1937 respectively. The doyenne of the genre knew the appeal of Christmas very well. Agatha Christie was in the habit of publishing a new novel in November, ready for the festive season. This was not just commercial nous: it seemed that Christmas was a good time for murders. Some of these whodunits were themselves set at Christmas. In 4.50 from Paddington, for instance, an old friend of Miss Marple comes to visit her for Christmas and witnesses a murder out of her train window. In Hercule Poirot’s Christmas, a millionaire is found murdered on Christmas Eve, in a locked room in his country house. The suspects are the members of the victim’s family who have gathered for this seasonal celebration.
It is not just genre fiction. One of the great Victorian novels features a Christmas murder. We can console ourselves this Christmas that our domestic celebrations, however undermined by rows or culinary disasters, will at least end less catastrophically than Christmas in Weatherbury in Far from the Madding Crowd. The wealthy Farmer Boldwood throws a grand Christmas party for the locals in order to celebrate the promise that he has extracted from Bathsheba that she will eventually marry him. Roasting and basting take place all day. Preparations for dancing are made. The mistletoe is carefully hung. “That the party was intended to be a truly jovial one there was no room for doubt.” Bathsheba still wears black, in mourning for her husband, Sergeant Troy, who disappeared, apparently drowned, a year earlier.
Troy of course is not dead but in the local inn, priming himself with brandy ahead of a surprise return. The publican divines that this will be a Christmas to remember. “My eyes and limbs – there’ll be a racket if you go back just now – in the middle of Boldwood’s Christmasing!” But a racket is exactly what Troy intends. He arrives just after Bathsheba has accepted the ring that marks her engagement to Boldwood. In his elevated spirits her successful suitor does not at first recognise the mysterious visitor, wrapped against the cold, and invites him in to “drain a Christmas beaker with us”. When Troy reveals himself and summons his wife to leave with him, the despairing Boldwood ends the party with a bang. He shoots Troy with one barrel of his shotgun and is only just prevented by a servant from using the other barrel on himself.
It is a seasonal catastrophe worthy of EastEnders, where Christmas is invariably the season of violent amorous strife and unwelcome reappearances. It is at Christmas that the fissures in relationships open wide, in Albert Square as in Henrik Ibsen’s A Doll’s House.
When the play begins, Nora Helmer is returning home with Christmas presents, accompanied by a porter who carries a Christmas tree. It will be hidden from her children until the evening, when it will be decorated. Yet Christmas brings guests with every kind of unwelcome news, including (it being Ibsen) revelations about Nora’s past: for the sake of her husband’s health, she has obtained money by forgery and one of the employees at her husband’s bank is blackmailing her. When act two opens, the tree is in the corner of the room, but “stripped of its ornaments and with burnt-down candle-ends on its dishevelled branches”. It is Christmas Day, but any conventional jollity is over. Nora is tormented by the crisis in her life and the children are somewhere offstage, playing with their presents.
Festive celebration is a kind of descant to domestic tragedy. Nora’s husband, Torvald, who treats her as a child or a pet in the first act, discovers her crime and condemns her. When the evidence of what she has done is destroyed and he hypocritically “forgives” her, she decides to leave him – and her children. “I set you free from all your obligations,” she says. “You are not to feel yourself bound in the slightest way, any more than I shall.” She hands back her wedding ring and exits. Famously, the play ends with the sound of a slamming door. Audiences and reviewers were shocked at Nora’s desertion of her children, made deliberately more shocking by having her do so at Christmas.
The special gathering of the family makes for satisfying conflicts and disasters. Things go wrong at Christmas, as if the year has been saving them up and knows that now defences are down and the hospitals operating with skeleton staff. Kingsley Amis’s beyond-dark depiction of old age in the English countryside, Ending Up, takes us to the extremes of comic Christmas catastrophe: visiting relatives, Christmas pranks and an accelerated intake of booze brings death (farcically) to all the occupants of Tupenny-hapenny Cottage. In Jonathan Franzen’s The Corrections, a Christmas family gathering is more subtly but no less inevitably disastrous. Early in this story of the Lambert family, Enid Lambert announces to her daughter, Denise, that she has planned “one last Christmas” all together at the family home in the midwest. Her tone is cheery, but the grim fact is that Alfred Lambert, the paterfamilias, is suffering from the early symptoms of the dementia that will before long make him oblivious to any such gathering. You can hear the gruesomeness of the oncoming festivities in Enid’s ruthlessly wheedling tones:
The promise of this family Christmas hangs over the novel like a dark cloud. Before it comes to pass, we follow the stories of the Lambert children: Chip, sacked from his academic job after a disastrous liaison with a student; Gary, affluent but depressed and alcoholic, in a battle of wills with his wife; Denise, pursuing a tormenting secret affair with her boss’s wife. Enid sends out hundreds of cards with her not entirely artful summary of family news, where she tries to turn all the Lambert failures and miseries into some sunnier narrative.
At the end of this long novel they do all dutifully, if resentfully, return to their childhood home for Christmas – and for the tragicomic reckoning we always knew was coming. Briefly they are all in the same room together on Christmas Day, and fury and mutual accusation duly ensue. Gary reveals Chip’s criminal activities in Lithuania. Alfred stands up – and collapses. Nobody opens their presents.
Anne Enright’s 2015 novel The Green Road uses the same device of ominous Christmas reunion that Franzen exploited. The four adult Madigan children are to be reunited with their widowed mother at the family home in the west of Ireland. The narrative takes us over the course of 25 years of the siblings’ backstories, ending at one climactic Christmas. They are drawn back from different parts of the world by their mother, Rosaleen, who both needs and exploits their affections. Rosaleen needles her children; tempers fray. Constance, the only Madigan who has stayed close to home, hears her mother announce that she is selling her house and moving in with her. And Constance shouts “Jesus!” because she has just realised that the sprouts are burning. Of course we are heading for a histrionic maternal meltdown, which is what Christmas is for.
Constance announces that she will not have her mother to live with her, so Rosaleen seals Christmas by staging a suitably dramatic disappearance. Her truculent children will be taught a lesson. “They would be sorry to find her gone. They would be very sorry. These people, who spent their entire time leaving her … Well two could play at that game.” Christmas brings relations together so they can tear each other apart.
But then the lonely Christmas is also a fertile literary theme. The student narrator of Donna Tartt’s The Secret History has to move out of his New England college during the Christmas vacation and ends up lodging in an unheated room in a warehouse, open to the winter elements. We know how isolated and desperate he is when we hear that he can only keep warm by going to church, where he dreams of the Christmases of his youth, “oranges, bikes and Hula Hoops, green tinsel sparkling in the heat”.
It is not surprising that Anita Brookner, a great analyst of solitariness, should use Christmas to dramatise aloneness. In Look at Me, her protagonist, Frances, a librarian, is proud of her ability to conceal her feelings from those she meets (while not quite concealing them from the reader). It is the loneliness of others that appals her. On Christmas Day she looks through the window of a local launderette and sees “three men and one woman, quite well-dressed, reduced to spending their day like this, and finding what company the desperation of others afforded them. I never wanted to see that again.” The “desperation” is entirely hers, of course.
Less weird yet more haunting than either of these is the isolation of Rosamund Stacey, the narrator of Margaret Drabble’s brilliantly spare novel The Millstone. Drabble’s clever, self-contained heroine becomes pregnant after her first ever sexual encounter; the father of the child knows nothing of the pregnancy and she has not seen him since they slept together. She now lives with her baby daughter, Octavia, who is discovered to have a heart defect. Characteristically, Rosamund declines invitations from family and friends to spend Christmas with them. On the night of Christmas Eve, her baby develops a cough and she leaves a neighbour to look after her while she goes to the nearby all-night pharmacist. It is, you might think, a lonely experience, yet Drabble’s narrator, changed by motherhood, rather relishes its purposefulness. In the chemist’s she meets George, her child’s unknowing father, and invites him back to see her child. She lies about her age so that he will remain deceived. And then he leaves, none the wiser, the fact of Christmas focusing her solitariness. “Love had isolated me more securely than fear, habit or indifference.”
Perhaps hell is those other people, making merry. Scrooge’s discovery of “humbug” all around him at Christmas has a touch of shrewdness in among all his self-tormenting misanthropy. Dickens is perfectly able to see through the falseness of some seasonal jollification. While he is remembered as the man who invented a merry and sentimental Christmas, he knew about nightmarish Christmases too. When Pip sneaks into the pantry at dawn in Great Expectations, to steal food for Abel Magwitch, the escaped convict he has encountered in the churchyard out in the marshes, he finds it peculiarly well stocked because it is Christmas. And Christmas means the compulsory company of Mr Wopsle, Mr and Mrs Hubble and the utterly insufferable Uncle Pumblechook. Every Christmas Day this is the gathering – and every Christmas Day, Uncle Pumblechook says the same things.
Pip, squeezed into an angle of the table with “the Pumblechookian elbow in my eye”, is condemned not only to the worst cuts of meat but also to the jibes of the company (with the exception of gentle, silent Joe Gargery). They tell him that he should be grateful and that he never is. They lecture him on gluttony as they stuff their faces. They wonder what he would have been like if he had been born a pig. Mrs Joe’s guests for Christmas dinner each year manage to be at once boring and cruel. But this particular Christmas is worse than any other, for Pip is tortured by his terror at the impending revelation of his pilfering. That huge pork pie, intended as the pièce de résistance of the Christmas feast – “such a delightful and delicious present of Uncle Pumblechook’s!” – has in fact been given to the convict. Discovery is inevitable. The moment approaches. This Christmas is a child’s nightmare, both frightening and banal. Dickens knew that we will always remember our childhood Christmases – especially the worst ones.
Bouncing a chattering toddler on her knee, a patterned headscarf framing her broad smile, Safa shows few signs of how difficult her life has been. But as she describes the past five years, her hand moves instinctively to her pregnant stomach.
In 2012, Safa and her husband, both in their late 20s, were living in Aleppo when a blast destroyed their home, injuring him and leaving them with nothing. The young couple travelled by bus to Lebanon where, for six months, they shared a room and one toilet with 10 other people. Surviving on a tiny stipend from the UN, they were eventually given their own room – “about the size of this”, she says, gesturing to a small table – in return for collecting all the rubbish in the block. It was there that she gave birth to her first child, a daughter, now 18 months old. “We were treated like animals,” she says.
It was in Lebanon that the new family learned they would become three of the 20,000 Syrian refugees the British government has agreed to take through the vulnerable persons relocation scheme. Of the news that they would be flown to Leeds, Safa recalls simply, “It was wonderful, like a dream.”
She became pregnant again soon after arriving in the UK, something that meant her life might still be at risk. Asylum-seeking and refugee women currently account for 14% of all maternal deaths in the UK (despite comprising only 0.5% of the population) according to the Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries. Navigating the British health service without the language or confidence to ask the right questions, their interaction with maternity services can be too little or come too late, with complications going undetected. Asylum-seeking and refugee women are statistically more likely to experience late miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal death.
In the UK, Safa faced the prospect of giving birth without anyone she knew in the room. “My husband will be looking after her,” she explains, whispering Arabic into her daughter’s ear. “And we are alone here – we had to leave all our friends and family in Aleppo.”
Thanks to a newly revived befriender scheme run by the Refugee Council, Safa will not be alone. Last week, she was introduced to Fatoma, a bustling, maternal woman in a denim maxi dress and peach headscarf who scoops Safa’s daughter up and tickles her. Fatoma fled the civil war in Sudan 10 years ago, arriving in Leeds; she has volunteered to support Safa through her pregnancy and the early stages of motherhood. She grins at her new friend: “I met her for the first time on Tuesday, and she has already asked me to be at the hospital during her labour.” Fatoma understands what it is like to be alone in a country you do not understand, and which often does not understand you. When she gave birth to her daughter six years ago, it was “terrifying, confusing and lonely”, she says, wiping away a tear.
I meet Safa and Fatoma in a municipal office space in Leeds. They are among a small group of mothers (Sudanese, Syrian, Russian, Bolivian) who sit and trade stories, passing their babies between them. Each experienced a terrifying flight from her home country. Now, through the Refugee Council, each of them has volunteered to support another pregnant woman. “These are some of the most marginalised women in our country,” says Rose McCarthy, volunteer coordinator for the scheme, which started in 2011 and is currently relaunching with a focus on Syrian women. “But they believe no one should have to give birth in this country afraid and alone.”
With Fatoma translating her Arabic, Safa explains: “I don’t yet speak English, so when I have the baby I want someone with me I can trust and speak to in my own language.” She looks shyly at Fatoma. “I feel so much better already, knowing that she will be there.”
When Luisa arrived in this country from Bolivia in 2009, she spoke barely a word of English. Knowing no one, she spent two years determinedly learning the language by watching TV. When she became pregnant a few months later, it was a shock. “She was my first baby, so I didn’t know very much about being pregnant, or about labour,” she says. “I didn’t even have a GP. And I didn’t know about midwives – they don’t exist where I come from.” When she gave birth, “It was horrible – I felt like I was being torn apart.”
At home in Chuquisaca, she was a law student. She was organising demonstrations against the government when, in 2008, there were violent clashes between supporters and opponents of President Evo Morales. Her friends began to disappear and her mother, fearing her daughter would be next, sent her to the UK. After her baby, also called Luisa, was born, the two were briefly sent to a detention centre, before being moved from London to Leeds.
“I became paranoid,” Luisa says. “I had an appointment at the Home Office, but no money to get there. I went to the Refugee Council offices to ask for emergency funds, but I’d already received some and they said no. I was desperate. I had no money to feed my daughter, so I left her there in the offices, making sure she was safe. Then I walked out and tried to kill myself.”
She took an overdose of sleeping pills. Meanwhile, staff at the Refugee Council had found her telephone number, called her and kept her talking until an ambulance arrived. When she was discharged from hospital, Luisa was referred to the befriender scheme as a new mother in need. At the charity’s offices, Luisa had her first meeting with her volunteer befriender, Dasha.
“I didn’t want to know at first,” Luisa admits. “For a long time, I’d only really interacted with people who sat behind desks, asking lots of questions I didn’t feel comfortable answering. I felt everyone was pitying me, and I can’t stand pity. But Dasha was really funny, and really persistent. If I cancelled a plan to meet up, she might turn up on my doorstep. She worked in a cafe and would bring cake. For the first time since I arrived in this country, she talked to me as an equal, not an inferior.”
Dasha, whose family claimed asylum in the UK from Russia 15 years ago, took Luisa to playgroups. Together, the women joined self-esteem classes provided by students from Leeds University in collaboration with the Refugee Council. “She even bought me a Christmas present,” Luisa says with a smile.
One day, Dasha dropped by Luisa’s flat and found her young daughter falling in and out of consciousness. “Luisa didn’t know what to do,” Dasha remembers. “There was deep snow outside but I told her we had to get to the hospital.” She bundled the three of them into a taxi and they rushed to A&E.
“The doctors were talking about terrifying possibilities, and making Luisa sign all sorts of forms,” Dasha tells me. “Everything turned out fine, but sometimes you just need a friend, someone who knows how the system works, someone who can explain and hold your hand, who can pack an overnight bag and bring snacks for you.”
There are many reasons why migrant women might fail to engage with health services. Like Luisa, their isolation might mean they simply do not know about them. Others fear being charged for services they cannot afford: undocumented women can be charged up to £9,000 for giving birth in this country; last month’s government proposal that patients could be required to bring two forms of identification to hospital to alleviate so-called “health tourism”, has fuelled further fears.
Pregnant refugees often need urgent care. They are likely to have arrived in this country malnourished, with conditions ranging from tuberculosis and malaria to HIV. Plus, as Dasha says, “They come here to escape from danger – how could they not be psychologically damaged, too?” Yet those who do access help often report poor experiences: no interpreters, or midwives and other maternity workers who do not understand their cultural and health needs.
In Leeds, any English-speaking, asylum-seeking and refugee mothers can apply to be befrienders. Successful applicants undergo four training sessions, which cover listening and empowerment skills, as well as understanding how health and maternity care differs across cultures. In 2011, 74 women speaking 30 different languages were recruited as volunteers and matched with 180 women in Leeds, referred by midwives, children’s centres and community refugee organisations. Research carried out after the first year showed that every woman involved reported a higher sense of wellbeing.
Funding for the scheme ended in 2014 – but three months ago, McCarthy managed to revive the programme, specifically to support the 419 Syrians who have been resettled in the Yorkshire and Humberside region since October 2015. Her old volunteers have flooded back, along with new ones. Since September, McCarthy has recruited and trained 40 volunteers. The first three befriending pairs have already been matched. With 1,340 Syrians expected to settle in the region over the next two to three years, “there is a big appetite for it”, she says.
When Alia arrived in the UK this year, she had to hide the fact that she was more than eight months pregnant: she feared being banned from the flight. She was fleeing the genocide in Darfur, Sudan (where an estimated 480,000 people have now been killed), to meet her husband, who had already made the arduous journey and settled in Leeds.
“I took her to the local children’s centres, and to antenatal classes,” says Muna, a volunteer befriender, and another Darfur refugee, who met Alia within days of her arrival. Then one evening her phone rang. “Her husband was crying,” Muna remembers. “He said: ‘We’re at the hospital and they say there is an infection. The baby is in danger. We need an emergency caesarean but Alia won’t consent.’”
While Muna tells their story, Alia quietly nurses her five-month-old son, Sammy. “I was scared,” she says softly, with Muna as her translator. “Where we come from, when you do this sort of operation, either the baby or the mother dies.”
“So I ran,” says Muna. “I dropped everything and ran all the way to the hospital. I didn’t see the cars. Everything was a blur.”
This wasn’t just any running: Muna had competed in the 800m for Sudan in the 2008 Olympic Games. Minutes later, she was at Alia’s bedside. “I knew nothing about caesareans. I was terrified,” she says. “But I held her hand and I said: ‘You must do this and I will go in with you. I will talk to you while they do it, and you can talk to me, and the baby will be fine.’”
The two women went into theatre together. Moments later, Sammy was born, a greenish blue, but alive. “When it was over, I cried,” says Muna, “I could stop being brave for her. Afterwards, I was with her every day, I helped her with breastfeeding, how to bathe the baby – I am like her second mum.”
Officially, volunteer befrienders are only expected to give up three hours of their time a week, and are under no obligation to attend the birth itself. Often, however, three hours turn into much more, and partnerships turn into lifelong friendships. Many befriended women end up as volunteers themselves. Luisa, for example, has become a vocal campaigner for the scheme. “Last week I chaired a debate,” she says, smiling. “I’ve spoken in parliament, in conferences and schools. I even went to Glastonbury festival to talk.”
Other women have gone on to find paid jobs after volunteering. “There’s nothing like this work,” Dasha says. “It gives you such self-confidence, a feeling of doing good.” She now works for the council, providing information about housing support.
As midwives become increasingly overstretched, McCarthy hopes that similar schemes could be introduced across the UK. “Befrienders make the most enormous difference,” she says. “They are figures of trust for women who may be scared to trust others.”
I leave the group of women chatting and giggling, and cooing over Sammy, who is now sleeping soundly. One more healthy baby, and a life saved by a group of ordinary, extraordinary women.

Not enough research has been done on the close relationship of our gathering for Christmas dinner to the classic waterholes of the world’s great deserts. Even the omniscient David Attenborough has been slow to examine the connection. In his current multi-part survey of the planet, there is a constant theme hammering: the deadly dangers facing animals that gather anywhere in order to drink. They might eat each other. Indeed, if they are on camera, they almost certainly will, thereby triggering Attenborough’s most plangently recurring threnody: “Yet this can be a dangerous place in which to linger.”
I speak as one in no need of education about the level of violence in the natural world. At Uluru once, I had a close-up of a plague of centipedes. A close-up was unavoidable, because they got into even your hotel room, probably through the airconditioning system. Most of the year, they aren’t visible. When they are, nobody has ever seen fewer than a million of them. What scared me most was the noise they made. I suppose their descendants are still making it. It was a kind of sizzling fizz, like bacon fat.
Roll forward a few decades, and I switch on the television to be confronted with the dauntless face of the male sand grouse. My notes go a bit haywire at this point, but I think the waterhole is somewhere in Africa. The remarkable thing, though, is that the grouse is at the waterhole at all. His family is camped 60 miles away, but it’s his turn to fly to the waterhole and pick up the water supply for the whole bunch of them. He loads up with water by splashing it into his chest feathers, which are fluffily adapted to carry half his body weight in liquid. Then, after heeding Attenborough’s warning about the dangerous place in which to linger, he takes off for the 60-mile flight back to his thirsty family. One need hardly note that a good three-quarters of the other species gathered around the waterhole are well equipped to make mincemeat of him.
Attenborough hasn’t time actually to tell us this, but one imagines that a good few millennia of evolutionary experience went into the grouse’s decision that 60 miles was about the right distance to be away from the waterhole. Similarly, my own behaviour at the Christmas table is based on the judicious application of hard-won learning. From my early life onwards, I took it to be mandatory that I should be as entertaining as possible, so as to ensure being given first crack at the goose’s leg. Time has at last taught me that if I sit there in silence, my chances of being awarded the goose’s leg will go up, not down.

This picture was taken in 1954, at my parents’ engagement party in Hamilton, New Zealand. My dad, Michael McKeand, and my mum, Ruth Unwin, both 19, had been in New Zealand for just two years through the £10 pom scheme, set up after the second world war to encourage Brits to emigrate to NZ. They were there because in 1952 Ruth’s family left Liverpool to start a new life at the other side of the world.
Ruth had met Michael the previous year in Liverpool. He was getting off a train with his racing bicycle (he was a club cyclist) as she got on with a friend of his. They chatted briefly and parted but, instead of cycling home, my dad belted down the road to the next station, swanned on to the train and, remembering that all’s fair in love and war, joined his pal and the pretty stranger. Not long afterwards, he proposed on Hilbre Island, Wirral, close to where they both lived. She accepted.
After a poignant farewell at the Liverpool docks, Michael set about saving money as a tailor’s clerk in the city before setting sail in 1953 to join Ruth and her family. He was just 17 when he arrived at the Unwins’ home with a single suitcase and, naturally, his bicycle.
Under the £10 scheme, Michael served his brief national service before being assigned a job in a wool factory, followed by a butter factory. But, armed with his prize for writing from Birkenhead school, he applied for a job on the Otago Daily Times. This started his lifetime career in journalism, ending in Fleet Street as a subeditor.
After marrying in 1955, Michael and Ruth spent five more years in NZ – during which time my brothers, John and Nigel, were born – before moving to Sydney, Australia, in 1960. He had landed a job there working for a young Rupert Murdoch. I was born there in 1964. Then, after 16 years away, my parents set sail with their young family to the UK, and on a cold February day in 1968 docked at Southampton. My dad’s brother and his wife met us off the boat. Having been kitted out in coats and jumpers (we didn’t own any!) we started a new life in the UK.
Michael and Ruth have just celebrated their 61st wedding anniversary, have 11 adoring grandchildren, are still making each other laugh, and are as much in love as they were the day this photo was taken all those years ago.
Get Down by Gilbert O’Sullivan
“Told you once before / And I won’t tell you no more / Get down, get down, get down.”
Family car journeys to visit relatives could so easily become tedious affairs, especially once the obligatory I-Spy session reached its natural conclusion. That’s when my younger sister Catherine and I would often resort to singing the latest hits to help the time pass quicker. There was no car radio or cassette player in our Ford Escort, so it was usually a reprise of what we’d heard on the latest Top of the Pops.
Dad’s parents lived in Southampton, requiring a 100-mile trip from our home in Essex. Dad was more into classical music, Mum more the musicals, but I like to think they tolerated the mini-concert emanating from the back seat. It was a great year for child-friendly glam rock in 1973, but the song that transports me back to our Easter holiday trip to the south coast is Get Down by Gilbert O’Sullivan.
At the age of 11, I wasn’t really a fan but at the time he was a regular fixture on TOTP and Get Down must have been No 1. The lyric also sounded appropriate to the occasion; it conjured up an image of parents who were getting irritated by the antics of children behind them.
Memories of singing on that April day are particularly poignant. The next time we embarked on that route was for Dad to make arrangements for Nan’s funeral. Grandad couldn’t really cope with the big house on his own so he downsized to a flat too small to sleep us all. Therefore our belting out of Get Down and its ilk somewhere on the A3 signifies something special: a time before my cosy family world was rocked irrevocably.
Ingredients
Into a large pan, weigh out the following:
8oz (225g) butter or margarine
8oz (225) brown sugar
4oz (110g) golden syrup
4oz (110g) black treacle
2 level tsp bicarbonate of soda
Mix thoroughly, then add two beaten eggs. Warm half a pint of milk and pour into a bowl on top of two level teaspoons of bicarbonate of soda. Add this to the mixture, stir well, then pour into a roasting tin and cook for about one hour and 15 minutes at 150C (gas mark 2).
This was the cake of my childhood, rolled out by my mum for every bake sale, school fete and visiting relative. It is baked in a big roasting tin and makes so many pieces – one batch seems to last for ever, which was a shame as I hated the stuff. I guess it was too sophisticated for my preteen tastebuds, which preferred shoplifted Wham bars and cola Hubba Bubba.
I remember going to my first Brownie camp, with a Tupperware tub loaded with giant ginger sticky squares. The Brown Owls and Snowy Owls swooped on it but us young Imps, Elves and Pixies eyed it with deep suspicion, like we would blue cheese. Still, I was glad I brought that tub to camp. A reminder of home, vacuum sealed.
Lately, though, more than two decades on, I’ve quite fancied a slice. Delighted, Mum sent me a photo of her old handwritten recipe and I set about making some with my five-year-old son.
It’s dead quick and easy, but looks worryingly sloppy when you pour it into the roasting tin (“It’s like a gingerbread lake, Mummy”). But fear not, it rises beautifully. Even the edges I burned have a satisfying treacle toffee crunch. I think it is best drowned in custard.
Crucially, my son is a fan. But will he be so enthusiastic after the 95th batch?

‘I would like a weekend off now, please,” tweets my work friend Jemma, who, after nearly dying in a riding accident, has spent months dealing so well with the challenges of tetraplegia. I have taken heart in her hitherto positive messages, but read in that tweet her sorrow and the momentary, and understandable, desertion of her coping.
I am not sure that I share her strength, so often I have wished that fucking cancer’s cup had passed us by. It didn’t, but I am learning to deal with it in a way that mines some positives from the seabed of grief. So I take inspiration where I can.
I am suspicious that Matt, in his delight of Christmas, has bought me a book about RAF hero Douglas Bader. I have always found him fascinating, a man defined but not constrained by the accident that resulted in the amputation of both legs. I still love the story David Niven recounted about Bader giving a talk to an upmarket girls’ school, and describing the German planes attacking him as “the fuckers”. This prompted the pale-faced schoolmistress to interrupt with, “Ladies, the Fokker was a type of German aircraft,” to which Bader replied: “That’s as may be, Madam, but these fuckers were in Messerschmitts.”
I would love the story to be true. Many years ago, I had dinner with Peter O’Toole and, for all his many stories, he hadn’t heard that one, and hooted with mirth before reaching for his next bottle. “Bader’s stumps made him mentally stronger than his enemies and gave him a physical advantage in the air. With legs, you’d probably never have heard of him. Tragedy can grant gifts – something to learn there,” he finished, blue eyes twinkling my way. Star-struck and young, I had had no idea what he meant, but I do now.
Bader’s accident had made him mentally robust and determined not to be cowed or constrained by anything, and physically he was helped by the fact that his heart had less body to pump blood around, so he could peform tighter turns in a dogfight without losing consciousness.
For me, knowing that loss is now my brother is tragic but emboldening. I have no fear of change, or the decisions that change demands. When friends ask, “Will you look for another job in the media?” I say no with some certainty simply because I now see work as renting out bits of precious, short life – no money is worth something you no longer love. Bereavement is dreadful, but once you accept that the life you had is unrecoverable, you might just be able to create a new one that isn’t simply the old version but sadder.
So it was that when we briefed the brilliant stained-glass artist Tony with five of Helen’s passions for memorial windows in the Yorkshire house – a cathedral’s medieval knocker, an art deco light at the local cinema, her children’s story detective character, the battlements of the local historic house and the Hogwarts’ logo – I was reminded how much I loved stained glass and decided to go on a taster course in Scarborough.
There I met Dawn and her husband, Terry. We got on well, even going together to the theatre where Alan Ayckbourn is the director, with the great man sitting behind us critiquing the revival of one of his plays. Dawn seemed to be struggling. “It’s a shame,” she said, “but I’ve got cancer in my spine and won’t live very much longer.” I’m poleaxed, but also inspired. Just as Helen never stopped her piano lessons, Dawn is here on a course to learn a new skill because she enjoys it despite her illness. So many people spend their lives afraid of change, but I realise bereavement has gifted me a willingness to embrace it and not spend a moment of my life killing time or treading water.
So I approach Tony and will shortly be taking up a role as the oldest stained-glass-window trainee in the country. I know Helen would approve. Without her death, I would have had neither the courage nor the cash to take the plunge. She was the best part of me and in her loss I have gained an advantage over my risk-averse former self. It is another legacy of her love. I must not squander these new opportunities nor allow them to be shot down in flames out of fear.
Many of us will be spending Christmas with family this year. Some of us are wildly excited at the prospect, some ambivalent and some will be dreading it. In the days after the event thousands of people will be having tense discussions with their partner, stuck on various motorways around the country, about how next year they will be spending Christmas at home with the curtains closed and the door locked, and definitely not seeing family.
But it needn’t be like this, in fact when asked about fun in childhood, most adults talk about family as the most significant factor in their having fun. So here are seven sure fire ways to ensure fun festivities with the family.
Fun is social, families are social. Families are tight-knit units where members are assumed to have a good time with one another. However, they are full of “characters” who know each other well – and often familiarity breeds contempt. But rather than getting annoyed at the foibles of family members, revel in them. Enjoy the bizarre interactions. You can make a game of such idiosyncrasies by playing “family eccentricities bingo”, where a bingo card listing things that people always say or do is given out to everyone on Christmas Eve. The objective is to fill the card by Boxing Day. The winner gets to choose the route of the ever-popular Boxing Day “bracing walk”.
Fun is often vicarious. Much of the fun we have is when others are having fun. This is never more evident than at Christmas, where the fun can deteriorate as the day wears on – particularly when the kids have been up since 3.30am. To avoid this, make sure you pay attention to the fun of others. That can be in ensuring that everyone is happy or content. They needn’t necessarily be having fun, but you will be.
Fun and funny aren’t the same thing. When Christmas is going well, the house is full of laughter. However, fun and funny are different things. Be careful that laughter is not directed towards one or two people consistently. Fun happens when people feel part of a group, and laughter can be a means of exclusion, even if it is not intended to be. This means paying attention to what we say and how we say it – and this needs care and a certain degree of management.
Fun is contextual. Think in advance of the situations in which your family tends to have fun. It is tempting to suggest things to do at Christmas because they always happen – but if nobody really enjoys a “nice board game”, why insist everyone play one? You can be imaginative about the ways in which some things your family do well can be accentuated. If you are in a family of show-offs, do things that allow people to show off. If your family is less gregarious, think how individual family members can feel included, but the key is that things are done together.
Much fun is had through repetition. For many of us, tradition plays a significant role at Christmas – particularly important for children. Make the most of your family traditions – perhaps invent new ones. Talking about the past is often fun and there are family stories that get told and retold. Make sure you make time for conversations about Christmases past – the children love hearing about their family in bygone years and older family members will love telling you all about it … again.
… but be relaxed about spontaneity. Many people find fun takes them by surprise and being spontaneous is important. This does not sit comfortably with many of our experiences of the festive season. Christmases are often planned with military precision, but it can be liberating to imagine that not all of the plans need happen if something else fun is going on. Treat the plans as a guide that will be partially met. As long as everyone is having fun, the overall objective is met. Mission accomplished.
Turn off the screens. Other people are at the heart of our fun. At Christmas the temptation is to concentrate on the material stuff – presents – and increasingly this means screens. However, the Christmases we remember fondly are full of happy times talking and laughing with those close to us.

I was in a local pub recently when I  overheard a lament about Christmas opening hours. Contrary to what you may hear in The Archers or see in EastEnders, many British pubs now close on Christmas Day. The man at the bar was clearly troubled. Where was he to go on 25 December? The landlord – who was obviously looking forward to putting his feet up on Christmas Day – said there were quite a few websites that would tell you which nearby pubs were staying open, but I could see his regular was troubled. Not only was this the pub where he had always drunk on Christmas Day, but he had suddenly lost his surrogate family and at the most vulnerable time of year.
Depending on your circumstances, Christmas Day can be a nightmare. It is up there with Valentine’s Day if you are unhappily single, and Mother’s Day and Father’s Day if your children aren’t speaking to you. You can’t pretend it is just another day and simply get on with your life. Everyone and everything is telling you it’s Christmas Day. Even the Queen gets in on the act. There are few worse days to be on your own. It happened to me 14 years ago.
Newly divorced and with a lovely new flat in a new city, I stood at my picture window and watched a family – grandparents, mother, daughter and dog – going for a bracing post-lunch walk. Seeing them striding out, with an ecstatic dog and a young daughter in new gloves and coat rushing ahead, I remember thinking, “I’m like you. I’m sure if you met me, we’d get on.” But I knew I couldn’t nip down, introduce myself and say, “I’m all alone on Christmas Day. Can I walk with you?” They would have called the little girl over and put her safely between the mother and grandmother until the strange, sad man went on his way.
I wasn’t entirely alone in the world that day. On Christmas Eve, I had taken my children to their grandparents and we had opened presents over breakfast on Christmas morning and then I had driven them to their mother’s and come back to my flat.
At first, I felt like Matt Damon as The Talented Mr Ripley having his solitary Christmas in Rome. I unwrapped my presents, ate and drank some special things I had saved up for the big day. I may even have watched The Talented Mr Ripley. I certainly fell asleep at one point in best post-prandial style.
But when I woke up and walked to the window and saw that family, it hit me that here I was, in my late 40s, and life had only ever prepared me for “Christmas Day with family”, not to spend it on my own. I had been enjoying the single life up until that moment.
For many people who are on their own at Christmas, there are surrogate families. Going to church or helping out at a refuge can supply a sense of community, but as we lose pubs that offer open house on Christmas Day, we are losing the kind of family that many single men crave, the kind of benign family where you can drop in and chat, or keep to yourself but still feel welcomed by fellow human beings.
So how do we cope, we men who are looking at being on our own on Christmas Day? I address this question deliberately to men because I am one and can’t really speak to the female experience – although I have always felt that women have more effective support groups than men. But that is only because we have none.
It is a question of attitude. My overwhelmingly strong feeling was that I needed a family on Christmas Day. But Christmas doesn’t have to be about families. That was my mistake.
When I think back to The Talented Mr Ripley, Christmas Day is presented as the moment of perfect stillness in Tom Ripley’s turbulent life. In his Rome apartment, he plays the piano and sits by the fire opening a present that he has bought himself and that he clearly loves. Yet it is not the present, the music, or even the glass of wine he sips, that makes this moment special, it’s the stillness. The world stands still on Christmas Day. This stillness, at a point when the planet feels as if it has ceased to turn – and we will remain in the depths of a silent winter for ever – is a great moment to recharge our spiritual batteries.
Looking back, I see it was a mistake to gaze longingly at that family out on its bracing walk. I should have been enjoying the calm of a Christmas afternoon entirely on my own, rather than wishing it away. I was outside family life for the first time and, instead of appreciating the wonderful silence, I wanted to get back into family life as soon as I could.
The funny thing is, exactly 12 months later I drove my children from their grandparents to their mother and, instead of driving back to my flat, I drove on to Devon with the M5 entirely to myself (a very odd experience that quickly convinces you that zombies have taken over). When I got to Bideford, there was the family I was going to marry in to three months later. There were grandparents, there was my fiancee, there was her nine-year-old daughter and there was the dog.
I don’t quite know how I managed it. They can’t have been the family I saw walking that Christmas afternoon, but it was strange how what I got for that Christmas was exactly what I had craved the year before.
But my point is not that if you wish for something hard enough, you will get it. The world is full of people who have wished hard and been desperately disappointed. No, my point is that if you are alone without a family this Christmas Day don’t wish it away but see if, like Tom Ripley, you can enjoy it. I think you can.
The first of the three fathers that Nicky Loutit remembers is Robert Kee. He had been a fighter pilot and prisoner of war, and later became a writer, broadcaster and member of the “famous five” who founded TV-am. He was handsome, charismatic and angry.
Aged two-and-a-half, Nicky was put in a children’s home by her mother, Janetta, who is now 95. “She said to me recently that she knew I didn’t like that home, but she was so mad about Robert that she put me there for my own protection,” says Nicky. “She felt she was saving me. I remember crying and crying and crying. Still now, it makes me cry. If I’d talked about it 10 years ago, I probably wouldn’t have cried.” Getting older, says Nicky, now 73, she “feels more tender”.
Nicky is a painter who has produced a unique and haunting memoir, in pictures and words, of her extraordinary childhood. It reveals a trio of fathers who were highly regarded figures in public, but who, in private, variously inflicted on her mental, physical or sexual abuse.
She is upset when we meet because an event to promote her book has been marketed as, “Come and meet Nicky Loutit, the sexually abused child from the London elite.” Her publisher points out that this is all true. “I don’t remotely feel I am an ‘abused child of the cultural elite,’” says Nicky. “The book is more about an old person remembering ghastly things and the emergence of exquisite beauty.”
Then again, she recognises the possibility that her distress about the event is a form of denial. “I’m astonished at the power of denial. Even when I was little, teachers might say, ‘I understand you’re from a broken home.’ I was like, ‘That’s fine.’ ‘No self-indulgence’ and ‘nobody is special’ was what I picked up from my mother and her friends. I was in constant pain, but I didn’t recognise it. I had this wonderful act, acting cool, and it was gross denial. Gross denial gave me the strength to get through.”
Nicky was the first child of Janetta Slater, a beautiful young bohemian woman who mixed with leftwing artists and writers of 1940s and 50s London: Kee, George Orwell and the literary critic Cyril Connolly. Unsurprisingly, given Connolly’s famous dictum about “the pram in the hall” being an enemy of good art, Nicky felt unwanted, an impediment to the creative high-achievers around her. “That’s what made me so vulnerable to being abused,” she says. “I was desperate to be some use, in some way.”
When Janetta fell in love with Kee in the late 1940s, Nicky, her daughter by another man, was “in the way”. Nicky “genuinely can’t remember” if Kee pushed her down the stairs, but she had a terror of stairs as child. “He used to get hold of me and violently shake me, shouting, with his face very close to me. It was very frightening. He was jealous, resentful, maddened. For anyone else, he was charming, amusing and very popular.”
Nicky wasn’t in the care home for long and was reunited with her mother before being sent to boarding school. Nicky loved her new school uniform and tie but was subjected to a subtler form of mental abuse after her mother left Robert for Derek Jackson, a brilliant, wealthy physicist who split from Pamela Mitford to marry Janetta in 1951. Derek drove eight-year-old Nicky to her new school in his flash car. “He had this great Buick and I was embarrassed. He sensed my embarrassment and drove round and round on the gravel in front of the school. He loved it.”
Derek called her Knickers. “Oh, God, he was ghastly. I never liked him. He was quite happy to pay for me to go to school, he wanted to please my mother, but he didn’t care a fiddle about me.” He would test Nicky on maths and delight in her failures. She often confuses her numbers, even now.
Derek had a daughter with Janetta. “When my sister was born, Derek went off with my mother’s sister. My mother was devastated and miserable. It was all very frightening. The big question of my childhood was to help her be happy – it was the wrong way round, but that’s how it was.”
All the while, Nicky secretly idolised her biological father, Kenneth Sinclair-Loutit. He was a doctor who had treated casualties in the Spanish civil war and enjoyed an illustrious career with the World Health Organisation (“His life is an inspiration to all of us,” said a newsletter for former WHO staff after his death). Janetta never married Kenneth but Nicky bore his surname, looked a bit like him and “thought he must be wonderful”. She only met him a couple of times but her fantasy was sustained when he posted her “a really exciting American Indian leather jacket. I was thrilled with that present but it would be months, years between contact.”
When she was nine, the one reliable man in her childhood helped to reunite father and daughter. James MacGibbon was a publisher and friend of Nicky’s father Kenneth; Nicky played with James’s son, Robert, and adored them both. James, Robert and her father planned to sail across the Channel and on to Paris together and James, thoughtfully, suggested they invite Nicky along.
In her book, Nicky’s paintings recall her excitement about the trip, the boat setting sail and then the horror: her father forcing himself on her in a cramped cabin. He sexually abused her on their week-long journey across the Channel and up the Seine to Paris. She couldn’t tell anyone: “He specifically said it was something special between us.”
The MacGibbons slept in a separate cabin and didn’t know. They were appalled when Nicky told them 30 years later.
Boarding school was a release. “I felt saved by boarding school. I loved it but had to slightly pretend that I didn’t, because my mother and her bohemian friends were scornful of school,” she says. She was beaten by a maths teacher and then found friendship with one particular teacher. “He was wonderful, very inspiring,” she says. “He loved me and I was very important to him.” He took her on little excursions in his car and read Under Milk Wood and the Bible. He continued lessons in his bedroom, where several pupils joined him in bed. As his favourite, Nicky had to put her head on his chest. “Looking back, it was sexual, but it wasn’t overtly sexual like my father’s abuse,” says Nicky.
One day, she was swimming with other pupils, naked, in the lily pond in the school grounds (which, bizarrely, they were allowed to do). She had reached puberty and her friends were envious of her breasts, but he saw that she had “got too big” and “I wasn’t this sweet little girl snuggled up to him”. He ended their special relationship. “It was devastating. His rejection was like everything in my childhood. It wasn’t said, so I couldn’t reply, ‘Please don’t.’ It just happened. Suddenly, I was never invited into his room again.” She recalls his next favourite: a younger, skinnier pupil. “It was terrible,” she says.
“Everyone’s life is like that isn’t it?” says Nicky at one point. “This isn’t brute horror, it’s just normal life.” Doesn’t she feel angry about her abuse? “Oh. Anger,” she ponders. “A lot of the abuse wasn’t violent. I’ve had a very privileged life.” But she is angry with her father. “I can rage at the image of him in his grave. I can’t really speak to my father’s [other] children, who don’t really believe my father did anything, so there’s anger there.”
When she was 15, she met him again, in Paris. “He took me out to dinner and wanted the fantasy that we were lovers. I was terribly confused. He didn’t lie on top of me and do terrible things like he did when I was younger, but I was certainly in an abusive relationship.” A decade-and-a-half later, she confronted him about the abuse. “He cried and said, ‘Yes, I was a terrible bastard’ and he was so sorry. I even managed to feel sorry for him, but he tried to continue his sick relationship with me. He was never really sorry and he never really changed.”
Nicky’s adulthood has been shaped by this abuse. Most disastrously, when she was a young mother, with three young boys, she and her ex-husband joined an ashram in India led by a charismatic, free-loving, abusive guru. Nicky was beaten up in group “therapy” yet remained in the ashram for four years. Nicky knew she must escape and eventually returned to Britain, where she raised her three boys. “Was it being a painter?” she wonders. “Somehow I knew there was beauty in life too and I had to get out.”
Nicky can now talk about her three abusive fathers but is less comfortable discussing her mother: “Her own mother died while she was pregnant with me and she hated her father. She was a lost, beautiful young thing in the war. She talks about me in rosy, romantic terms, what a wonderful, independent child I was – ‘independent’ is the biggest praise she can give anyone. That was just how posh parenting was in those days: children were seen and not heard.”
In contrast, Nicky’s three grown-up sons are “absolutely central” in her life. “They are all terrific, which is amazing because I’ve not been a terrific mother,” she says. “The only thing I’ve done is consistently loved them.” Despite her traumatic childhood, her life, she says, has been full of beauty. “Painting isn’t an escape, but through creating I’ve realised the depth of existence. Even if I’m agonised, there’s another side full of joy and light. I’ve had such a rich life and I’m grateful. I suppose I was enabled to explore, even when things were very painful.”
She does not see herself as a victim. “Funnily enough, being a victim is one of my mother’s positions,” she says. “My mother was quite clear, ‘All men are bastards’, but because of the abuse, if men wanted me that was wonderful.” When she met her current husband, the author Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy, she was “startled that he could be so kind,” she says. “The major thing he’s done is allow me to be myself and we’ve really, really loved each other ever since, so that’s all right.”
I wonder at her achievement of enjoying loving relationships when her childhood was cursed by terrible men. “How the hell have I done it?” she laughs. She points out that as well as her two marriages she’s had great support from James MacGibbon, his wife and their son, Robert, who is still a close friend. “I did feel loved,” she says. “There’s always been someone in my life who has sort of loved me.”

How is it that a ton of old metal can make a grown man cry?
This heavyweight bohemian is nearly 40, has four wheels and a fibreglass pop top. It’s my campervan, or to be precise it’s no longer my campervan as I have just sold it.
Each morning, the first thing I see outside my window is this crazy orange character – a free spirit of the 70s that doesn’t say much, but speaks to me in code. We have a telepathic relationship. Just a glimpse at those long simple lines makes me smile and for 10 years it has been my constant, my reliable friend, a conduit for my hopes, my dreams and most importantly my symbol of dad-dom. And over time this van has made me feel better about myself.
If I could, I would mate with such beauty – except he’s a boy and he’s called Dave.
The thought of him leaving home has created a hole in my heart, which I know will be VW-shaped. God, I’m going to miss him.
A decade ago, having just gone through divorce, I became obsessed with buying an old VW. It had to be the Type 2 and the more orange the better. That iconic shape was burned into my psyche ever since I bought a cheap split screen as a 20-year-old and drove through Europe for six months with my Australian girlfriend. Back then, Italy had the lira, Spain the peseta, and Greece the drachma. The trip felt terribly exotic.
But I wanted more than to just recreate a sense of freedom and adventure, I also felt the need to provide something my kids would think of as uniquely “dad”. It had to encompass an experience they would enjoy, look forward to and participate in because they wanted to, not because they felt obliged.
Having moved into a rather pokey and clinical flat, I couldn’t compete with the family home and, rightly or wrongly, felt I needed reasons for the children to want to be with me. Everything was smaller and darker where I lived, so what better way to make them think time spent with Dad was fun than by enjoying life under the stars?
The VW campervan had all the required prerequisites. It was one of the few objects that spanned the generations. It was stylish, cool and came with a fridge, which at one stage was more than could said for my flat.
It took months to find it. There were many fruitless journeys around the country, arriving a little too late for some, finding others held together by suspect welding and extra shiny ones with eye-watering price tags.
And then Dave came into my life and my van-tastic romance started. Owned by a loving family who spent years on careful renovations and getting him roadworthy, they initially eyed me with suspicion. It was as if I was being interviewed for a job. Was I good enough to care for Dave? Would I bring him up right? As they parted with their beloved, I noticed a deep sense of regret, but he was mine now …
After presenting Dave to the kids with the minimum of fuss (Oh yeah, Dad’s got a campervan, kids. Check me! Backflip!), I parked him outside and posed holding a large hippy flower. They looked quite proud.
Over the years, we set off at dawn to all parts of the country: Devon and Cornwall with a surfboard; the New Forest with bikes, and Norfolk to strap on harnesses for Go Ape treetop adventures. And each time we’ve parked, within seconds we’ve flipped up the top, dragged out the small gas cooker, and started to sizzle sausages. It’s been a bonding experience, but without the major fuss of camping under canvas. Then, in the evening, we’ve sat together under the stars, looking at the moon, knowing we’ll get a fine night’s sleep even if it rains.
I would drive Dave at a heady 57mph – not that he couldn’t go faster, it was just that I didn’t see the point. Dave was born in the slower, pre-internet era when having five gears was showing off. If Dave wanted to take his time, I may have been in the driving seat, but he was the cool dude calling the shots.
Few drivers took exception to my slowness and occasionally I was known to put my foot down. When heading back from Cornwall, my son and I were flagged down by an unmarked police car. I gave my son a cheery thumbs up thinking Dave had actually managed to sneak past the speed limit. Instead, we were given a lecture as the back wheel of my bike was inhibiting a full view of the brake light.
Back home, when my daughter was revising for exams, she’d sit in the van. I’d pop out every hour or so and there she was, on the main road, with her books spread over the van’s table. Dave had become her library and can take full credit for preparing a maths teacher of the future.
The van was a symbol of what fatherhood represented to me. He was dependable, fun and always there. He looked slightly bulky and just chugged along at his own speed. (Although, like any dad, he’d still got enough in the tank to attract attention with his own special dance.) And of course, he gave the illusion of being so damn cool.
For Christmas and birthdays they bought me model kits, VW miniatures, VW egg cups and salt and pepper shakers. Over the years, I became synonymous with my camper.
But then the inevitable happened. The children grew up. My daughter left home and my son went off to university. They acquired boyfriends and girlfriends and my reason for having Dave started to fade. Suddenly, all the van things we did together were being relegated to the past. Would the kids really want their dad, a middle-aged geezer with a dodgy T-shirt, at Glastonbury?
I secretly dreamed that one day I would again do the tour of Europe. But more sedately. Or, maybe the kids would implore me to take them to Cornwall for old times’ sake. And although I knew the truth, each time I tried to summon the courage to sell, I managed to find something else to do. I couldn’t bear to think of Dave’s smiley face no longer parked outside my door.
So I hung on, and for two years the van’s remained part of the family, waiting for a trip further than the shops. He’s been underused and over-cleaned and has been taxed and insured purely as an emotional crutch. I could not part with him – it was like being told I could never tell bad dad jokes again.
Then, of the blue, Dave’s previous owners contacted me. They inquired gently if he might one day want to return home. I wanted to scream: “But he is home! I’m the daddy! This is where he belongs.”
His old family missed him so badly that their lives had never been the same since I bought him. He was just the pick-me-up they needed. I was so touched, I really had no option.
The symmetry felt right and I realised I wouldn’t have to worry about him because he’d be back with another dad, doing all the things I once did. I was just passing on the mantle.
I’m a little choked as I wave goodbye. Dave’s work is done.
It started with the decorations. Christmas was once a supermarket plastic bag bristling with sweet, tacky, red and green tinsel that smelled like 20 years of pine, a string of mini pretend presents that, in spite of their very obvious hollowness, begged to be opened, and – most important – the angel tree-topper. Her face was a 1970s plastic nightmare. I loved her. She meant magic.
Apparently, my dad had bought the whole job lot from a petrol station, way before I was born. Little did I know, aged four, they had been purchased in the spirit of, “this’ll do”.
One December in the late 90s, they disappeared. I came home from school that evening to find something grim. Something unholy. Something … classy. My mum had been to Habitat. The arboreal costume jewellery of every Christmas I could remember had been replaced by wicker balls painted a matte gold so unenticing I cried. Where was the tinsel? Where was the beautiful drag queen-looking angel? Where was Christmas? As I sat weeping for the lost innocence of that day, my mum tried to explain to eight-year-old me what “naff” meant. The new decorations – if anything so insipid can be awarded decoration status – dangled like upcycled Weetabix. I’d recently learned about Hitler. I think I hated them more than Hitler.
So began my mum’s all-encompassing programme of de-sentimentalisation. She and my dad reinstated the “this’ll do” philosophy. And this time round I noticed. For my older siblings and me, Christmases and birthdays now, increasingly, meant one thing: cash.
“How much do we give them again?” my dad would ask my mum, before stuffing the contents of his wallet into cards to suit whatever occasion had been simmered down to the emotional equivalent of buying a pack of batteries.
By the time I reached my teens, my family’s cold war on gift giving was in full swing, fuelled by mutually assured disappointment. This didn’t start as an anti-capitalist, or anti-commercialisation movement; it was mostly just anti-effort. My mum’s reasoning was that taste is just too personal a thing. For her, being presented with some unknown thing wrapped in paper is to relinquish control. Why buy one another things we’re bound to hate when we could buy ourselves things we actually want? Eyes locked on the middle distance, she tells the story of when, in the 80s, my dad bought her seed pearls.
“You could barely even see them,” she says of the earrings that were – if her increasing volume is anything to go by – anathema to her. In all fairness, my mum has never been a seed pearl kind of woman. When I was three she had a pair of earrings made of pink liquorice allsorts, which I duly ate. The point is though, jewellery-wise, if it’s not loud, she’s not interested. To her, my dad’s choice of seed pearls prompted the question, “Who do you even think I am?”
My seed pearls were boat-shaped. At Christmas 1996, when I was seven, I suffered a mild identity crisis when I unwrapped a remote-control yacht. Just to clarify – this is in no way a case of “pity the poor, neglected child who got a toy yacht for Christmas”. I wasn’t upset, exactly; I was confused. I hadn’t asked for a yacht. I’m not sure I knew what a yacht was. When my older brother took me to the park to sail this “yacht” thing on the pond, I watched with bemused indifference as it bobbed around for 30 seconds before sinking like a shoe. I was almost relieved. The yacht wasn’t me at all, and I was disturbed at the idea of having to become a yacht person, so as not to offend a presumably senile Father Christmas. When I didn’t cry, my brother assumed I was dead inside, and we went home. Yacht-less. The highlight of that afternoon was learning what “capsize” meant. To this day, my dad claims I asked for that yacht. Knowing me, and not knowing yachts – I didn’t.
As far as my mum was concerned, the yacht incident was perfect fodder for her anti-gifting propaganda machine. “See what happens when other people choose possessions for us?” Maybe she’s right in a way. Perhaps gifts are just expensive emblems of how little we actually know one another. I still really wanted them though. I wanted wrapping paper. I wanted suspense. I wanted the “naff” Christmas decorations back. Where’s the mystery in opening a card and having a couple of banknotes flop on to your lap? It was borderline bureaucratic. Every birthday felt like payday for the job that was staying alive another year.
My brother, whose annual refrain is “Mum’s ruining Christmas again”, has managed to maintain his rigidly pro-gift stance. Meanwhile, I’m weakening. My terrifyingly practical older sister – now too busy with two young kids to wrestle with the endless email thread of family politics – has been on my mum’s side all along. My dad hovers in the background, shrugging from behind his laptop.
I have a suspicion that another one of my mum’s motives for her crackdown on gifting was the avoidance of mess. The first Christmas my now brother-in-law spent with my family, he was horrified to be woken up – at 7am – by my mum ushering us all down to the Christmas tree with the festive call of: “Let’s get this over with, I want to tidy.” Genuinely afraid of disobeying her, we sat in the living room opening our presents as quickly as possible, while my mum disposed of wrapping paper like some kind of bah, humbug robotic furnace.
I have friends who do “Christmas shopping”. Who agonise for days over what things their family may genuinely like. Granted, these friends probably have conventional Christmases with drunk uncles, and Monopoly, and turkey. I doubt they grew up – as I did – thinking Christmas dinner was all about screaming and tidying. Constant tidying.
There is nothing more festive to me than the melancholic, “hoooooooove”, of a vacuum cleaner, and my mum yelling, “Whose is this?” seconds before binning whatever “this” may be.
In recent years, the mess and sentimentality elements to gift giving were stripped so bare that, as an entire family, we’re down to one Amazon voucher.
Whoever has a birthday receives a now ceremonial email informing them that they are, for now, in possession of The Voucher, which has been paid for by the rest of the family. The Voucher is passed from person to person, from birthday to birthday. The Voucher is good. The Voucher is safe. The Voucher is invisible. All glory to The Voucher. Although, while it may work for birthdays, we haven’t figured out a way of making it work at Christmas. Perhaps the only logical solution is that we sit in a circle, each behind a laptop, and everyone buys an Amazon voucher for the person to their left. We all press “send” at the same time. One blow of a party horn indicates it is time for us to shake hands. The second blow signals the end of all festivities until next year.
This year, as usual, my mum has suggested a full moratorium on Christmas presents. A part of me wants to buy her something so meaningful that her faith in gift giving is restored. A much bigger part of me knows that, whatever I buy her, she’ll pretend to like it for about 15 minutes, begin to grimace, ask for the receipt, then dispose of the wrapping paper like it’s nuclear waste. All evidence of there ever having been a present will be demolished.
Twenty years on, my yacht may still be at the bottom of that pond. Coated in algae. Ignored by frogs. Serving as a wistful reminder to absolutely no one that, in some families, gift giving is futile.
The band I’m in has three gigs across the weekend – two in Kent, one in the West Country. At this time of year we tend to arrive at venues after dark, which can be disorienting. Later, while trying to establish a rapport with the audience, I’m reluctant to admit that all I’ve seen of their town is a pay and display car park, or to complain that poor mobile reception left me unable to look up interesting facts about the area.
Overall I try to avoid saying too much, but there comes an inevitable moment early in the first set when I have to talk while a guitar change is effected. In order to make these moments seem spontaneous and unrehearsed, we tend to rehearse them not very well. I once forced an audience to pretend to be from Salisbury so I could reuse an anecdote from the previous evening.
After the second show, in Kemsing near Sevenoaks, I drive home. When I arrive my wife is still up, sitting in the kitchen with a visiting friend.
“You’re not supposed to be here,” she says when I come in.
“I barely am,” I say. “I have to be up and out tomorrow.”
“How was the gig?” the friend asks.
“Fine,” I say. “I got flustered because my banjo wouldn’t stay in tune, and said stupid things.”
“Shut up about your band,” my wife says.
The next afternoon I arrive at South Petherton in the dark, after a three-hour drive. Once again I have no idea where I am, except in relation to the A303. After the sound check we have a brief discussion about who is going to speak and when, but nothing is settled.
“Is this Somerset?” I say. “Are we in Somerset?”
The hall fills. At the appointed hour we take the stage. Between the second and third songs, my inevitable moment arrives. I step up to the microphone, my mind a perfect blank.
“It’s great to be here in South Petherton tonight,” I say. “It brings us one step closer to our dream of playing in North Petherton.”
There is a collective intake of breath, followed by a long, rumbling boo and some hissing.
“I guess that means there actually is a North Petherton,” I say. The boos become louder and more sustained.
“Any North Pethertonians in tonight?” I say. “Maybe don’t raise your hands.”
I mention North Petherton several more times during the first set, each time eliciting catcalls and general derision. I feel I have united the audience in a single purpose, but I also get the sense I’m playing with fire.
During the interval, a local resident tries to explain.
“There’s a sort of ongoing antagonism,” he says. “It’s weird, because North Petherton is 20 miles away.”
“You mean they had to move it?” I say.
My confusion only deepens. It’s not as if the two villages are fighting over a playing field, or the rights to a shared aquifer. I get the impression few of these people have ever met a North Pethertonian in the flesh – it’s at least a 45-minute drive. It seems to me a wholly irrational hatred, based on ignorance, fear and misdirected post.
But the people of South Petherton know how to have a good time. Afterwards they come up to thank us, and to buy our promotional tea towels. They shake our hands as they file out, begging us to return soon.
“This was a good gig,” I say to the guitar player.
A man in a dark coat touches my elbow and leans toward my ear. “Seriously,” he says. “North Petherton’s a shithole.”

Sweet aromatics infuse the winter months: ginger, nutmeg, clove, clementine, spiced rum and brandy. Their exotic, warming flavours wrap around you like a warm blanket. My California blood almost curdled when I was first faced with Christmas pudding, but now I crave the concentrated sweetness of sun-dried fruits in midwinter. We all know a recipe for the classic, but why not switch things up now and again? This week, I’ve created five show-stopping alternatives to Christmas pudding.
At this time of year, I can’t get enough of cranberries. A traditional New York-style cheesecake is only made better with this tart, pungent compote.
Makes 1 cake
For the cheesecake
175g ginger biscuits
75g butter, melted
600g cream cheese
180g caster sugar
¼ tsp salt
¼ tsp cinnamon
A grating of black pepper
A grating of nutmeg
¼ tsp mixed spice
A pinch of ground allspice
2 tsp vanilla extract
4 eggs, plus 1 extra yolk
200g creme fraiche
For the cranberry compote
340g cranberries
300g caster sugar
Zest and juice of 1 orange
2 Grind the biscuits in a food processor until fine. Stir in the melted butter, then press into the bottom of the tin.
3 Beat the cream cheese with the sugar, salt, pepper, spices and vanilla until smooth. Beat in the eggs and extra yolk. Fold in the creme fraiche.
4 Wrap the bottom of the cake tin with tin foil, then scrape in the batter. Put it in a roasting pan large enough for it to sit in comfortably. Pour in water to 3/4 up the side of the cake tin and bake for 1 hour 20 minutes. It should have a slight wobble but be set around the edges. Allow to cool completely, then chill in the tin for at least 2 hours.
5 For the compote, add all the ingredients to a heavy-based saucepan. Cook for around 15 minutes, or until jammy. Allow to cool.
6 Serve the cheesecake with a dollop of the cranberry compote, or spread it all over the top.
Custard and cream are flavoured with ample nutmeg and booze, topped with perfectly ripe bananas drizzled with lashings of dark chocolate ganache.
Serves 6-8 
For the meringue
4 egg whites
¼ tsp salt
½ tsp vinegar
1 tsp vanilla extract
270g caster sugar
2 tbsp cornflour
½ a nutmeg, grated, plus extra to finish
For the custard
50g cornflour
4 egg yolks
600ml whole milk
100g caster sugar
½ tsp salt
2 tsp vanilla extract
For the cream
400ml double cream
2 tbsp rum
A grating of nutmeg
1 tsp vanilla
2 tbsp caster sugar
To finish
3 ripe (but not over-ripe) bananas
1 Preheat the oven to 110C/230F/gas mark ¼. Line a tray with baking paper. With an electric mixer, beat the egg whites, salt, vinegar and vanilla on a high speed until soft peaks form.
2 Whisk the sugar, cornflour and nutmeg together by hand, then add half to the frothy egg whites. Whisk until very stiff, then add the remaining sugar mixture. Whisk until smooth and glossy.
3 Pipe the meringue into a 23cm circle or oval, making a slight depression in the centre. Bake for about 2 hours. Remove from the oven. Transfer the meringue on to a cooling rack right away to cool completely.
4 To make the custard, have ready an iced water bath, with a bowl set inside it. In a small bowl, whisk the cornflour into the yolks.
5 In a heavy-based pan, heat the milk, sugar, salt and vanilla until it starts to foam. Pour a little over the yolks to temper, whisk, then return to the pan. Cook until the custard has thickened and coats the back of the spoon. The custard should be the thickness of a creme patisserie.
6 Transfer the custard to the bowl set in the iced water bath to stop it cooking any further. Cover the surface of the custard with clingfilm to prevent a skin forming. Chill.
7 For the cream, mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl. Whisk until it has just thickened into loose peaks, as it will continue to thicken after you stop whisking. Set aside.
8 To make the ganache, chop the chocolate finely and put in a heatproof bowl. Heat the cream until it is just bubbling, watching it closely to ensure it doesn’t bubble over. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate, and leave to sit for five minutes. Stir to combine and until the ganache is shiny.
9 To assemble the pavlova, transfer the meringue to a serving dish. Top with the custard, then the cream, and finally the sliced bananas. Drizzle with the ganache, and finish with a grating of nutmeg.
Dried figs are plumped with the remains of yesterday’s red wine and steeped in spices, then drenched in honey. The texture and stickiness of this one makes it my favourite.
Makes 1 cake
400g dried figs
165g unsalted butter
75g brandy
300ml red wine
Zest of 1 orange, and 25ml freshly squeezed orange juice
250g honey, plus extra for drizzling
1 egg
1½ tsp ground cinnamon
¼ tsp ground cloves
200g wholemeal wheat or wholemeal spelt flour
1½ tsp baking powder
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and line a 23cm cake tin with baking parchment.
2 Trim the rough stems off the figs, then chop into 1cm pieces. Cut the butter into small pieces and allow it to soften to room temperature.
3 Put the brandy, wine and dried figs in a heavy-based saucepan and simmer over a medium-low heat to plump the figs. After 15 minutes, remove the pan from the heat and cool for 20 minutes.
4 Add the orange zest and juice, then stir in the butter and honey. Leave for 15 minutes, then whisk in the egg.
5 In a separate bowl, whisk together the cinnamon, cloves, flour, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda. Slowly whisk into the wet ingredients. Transfer the mixture to the prepared tin, and bake for 45 minutes.
6 Cool the cake in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn out on to a plate. To serve, drizzle with a little extra honey and serve warm with yoghurt.
Claudia Roden’s orange cake is famous for its use of an orange boiled whole. I’ve spiced it up here with cinnamon, added whole, unpeeled almonds that you grind yourself, and drizzled it with a Cointreau-laced syrup.
For the syrup
Juice and zest of 1 orange
100g caster sugar
100ml water
Juice of 1 lemon
4 tbsp Cointreau or other orange liquor
2 Wash the oranges, then simmer them whole (including their peel) in a saucepan of water for two hours. Cool, then cut open and remove any pips.
3 Grind the almonds to a fine powder in a food processor, then set aside.
4 Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Cut the oranges into quarters and put in a food processor. Process to a pulp. Add the ground nuts, then the eggs one at a time, then the sugar and baking powder.
5 Scrape the batter into the prepared tin and bake for about an hour. Cool in the tin, and then turn out on to a serving plate.
6 For the custard, put the bay leaves and the cream in a heavy-based saucepan. Steep over a medium heat just until the cream comes to the boil. Watch it closely as it can boil over.
7 In a bowl, whisk together the yolks and sugar. Temper the yolks with a little of the bay cream, then return to the saucepan and whisk over a low heat for five minutes. Allow to cool.
8 For the syrup, put all the ingredients into a small saucepan. Reduce by half. Skewer the cooled cake, then pour half of the syrup over just before serving. Serve the remaining syrup separately for pouring over individual slices of cake with the custard.
This is made with the moreish caramel that results from reducing cream and sugar or condensed milk into a jam. Chocolate and cinnamon have a long history together in Mexico and here they make this delicious, self-saucing, flan-like dessert more Christmassy. The cake mixture and the flan mixture could both be made in advance and then assembled and baked closer to the serving time. Alternatively, you could bake the dish a few hours before serving and serve at room temperature, but it really should be made on the day.
For the cake
150g caster sugar
100g plain flour
40g cocoa powder
1 tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
¼ tsp baking powder
A pinch of fine sea salt
180g plain yoghurt
4 tbsp mild olive oil
1 egg
1 Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5 and have ready a roasting tray that is large enough to house a round or oval pudding dish, and is at least 4cm deep. Spread the dulce de leche inside the pudding dish, as if you were buttering it. Sprinkle with the Maldon salt.
2 For the cake, whisk together the dry ingredients. In a separate bowl, whisk together the yoghurt, olive oil and egg. Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and pour into the prepared pudding dish.
3 In a separate bowl, whisk together the evaporated milk, condensed milk, eggs and vanilla. Decant into a jug, and slowly and gently pour this over the chocolate cake mixture. You want to try to keep distinct layers at this stage.
4 Set the pudding dish within the larger roasting tray, then carefully fill the tray with water until it is halfway up the sides of the pudding dish. Cover the whole roasting tray with tin foil (shiny side down), and bake for one hour, until the chocolate cake has risen to the top and is set.
5 Remove from the oven and allow the pudding to cool for 10 minutes in the water. Remove from the water and cool for another 10 minutes. Run a small sharp knife around the perimeter of the pudding to separate it from the dish. Invert on to a serving plate and serve.
Do you remember that TV channel, Trouble? In the late 90s/early 00s, it was a colourful graveyard for American teen and young adult shows of the recent past, repackaged for young British eyes. It brought me TV shows no other channels would have thought to – and is how I came to watch The Parkers, and fall for the comedian and actor Mo’Nique.
The Parkers, a sitcom about a mother and daughter attending college together, was a nice break for Mo’Nique, now 48, but it was hardly her first outing in the business. She was doing stand-up before the siren call of TV, and if you haven’t watched her (filthy, hilarious, repeat: filthy) sets, particularly her turn on The Queens Of Comedy, I urge you to. Her jokes can be uncomfortable, but then they come from uncomfortable situations, and I appreciate that edge; her riff on “skinny bitches” will always make me laugh. Her raspy voice is like a shot of something strong and oaky, and her laugh is contagious, even when you’re semi-scandalised at the joke.
She has branched out from straight comedy, too: her stunning portrayal of Ma Rainey in the TV film Bessie shook me up; before that, she won an Oscar for her astounding performance in the 2009 drama Precious. She’s an agile dancer, too (her Instagram is a delight) and her little inspirational quotes about love and life give off the vibe of a woman who is happy with her lot.
But comedy’s still her main thing: earlier this year, she released a special, Mo’Nique’s Something Different, and her new family comedy, Almost Christmas, just came out. With that infectious laugh, she’s the best thing in it. Of course.

Television chef Michel Roux Jr has emerged this week as an unlikely champion of the common man. He is worried that restaurant goers do not understand the difference between a tip and a service charge, and hopes that others in the catering industry “will join me in making it clearer for the public to understand what they are paying for”.
He said this after admitting that his restaurant, the Michelin-starred Le Gavroche, keeps all the service charge added to its customers’ bills, instead of distributing the cash to staff.
Allow me to help. A tip is cash given to your waiter in a private transaction denoting personal gratitude and also shared knowledge that the restaurant trade generally pays front-of-house staff as little as it can get away with. A service charge is a ruse restaurants have developed in order to gain control over the tips their underpaid staff might otherwise receive. Which I think is pretty clear.
How could it be otherwise? Adding a service charge in a restaurant is like adding a body-covering charge in a clothes shop. The whole point of going to a restaurant is to sit at a table while people prepare and bring food and drink to you. Or, to put it more simply, to receive services. And pay for them. A service charge is a charge on your charge for services. The public is confused, as Roux knows perfectly well, because restaurants want us to be.
The trouble is that people are not as confused about Roux’s restaurant as they were a couple of weeks ago. First, it was revealed that staff in the extremely posh restaurant were being paid £5.50 an hour for a 68-hour week. Roux said he was sorry – presumably he meant for flagrantly breaking the law in this manner while assuming that the victims of this violation would protect him because they wanted the work.
But he couldn’t leave it there. When the thoughts of his critics turned to questions about what happened to service charges and tips, Roux, or a spokeswoman anyway, decided once again to have a go at outfoxing people. “Wages are not dependent on fluctuating levels of discretionary service charges or cash tips.”
That sentence has a terrible beauty about it. The spokeswoman is trying to make out that it would be terribly unfair to let staff rely on the vagaries of customer discretion and that they’re doing the staff a favour by “treating service charges as revenue”, so that no criminally underpaid staff member is left behind. They pay tax on the service charges, they explain. So if their staff need in-work benefits, they’re doing their bit there too. Lovely.
So, basically, Roux has come over all educate-the-public because he got caught out in deceiving the public. I say the public, though of course hardly anyone can afford to eat at Le Gavroche, which is now raising its menu prices because it’s removing its service charge. Which only goes to show what a moveable feast, if I may say, the service charge was in the first place.
The depressing thing is that this issue has been around for years. If the public isn’t by now fully educated about the less than transparent nature of service charges and the variations in how they are distributed, then we’re never going to be. The government is currently considering making it illegal for businesses to take any cut of service charges at all. This is a good idea, but as we have seen from the wages paid at Le Gavroche, the most putatively respectable and financially secure of businesses are not at all averse to breaking the law.
Yet more depressing is the fact that the public for whom Roux cares so greatly is so enthusiastically complicit in helping the world of business and finance towards its goal of a cashless economy – in which money can become entirely abstract even as it controls and tracks our every move. We don’t want to fart around with splitting bills on cards then digging around for cash to provide a tip as well, because we’re all convenience junkies. It makes it easy for businesses to hoover up everything.
And you can never tell the good guys from the bad guys. Plenty of restaurants are pretty scrupulous about ensuring tips are divided equally among employees. They’re the ones in which the staff are familiar figures, because they stay for years in their jobs. And that really is the second best way: the charming young people who know how to flirt will get plenty of tips, the acne-scarred washer-upper will get none. So pooling and dividing the tips evens out the Darwinism.
The best way, of course, is to set your wages so that neither the giver nor the receiver feels used or exploited, mutual respect is maintained and no one relies on tips at all. But, somehow, that kind of thinking seems to be something akin to totalitarian Marxism.
Meanwhile, back in the gentle world of the free market, the only thing to try to keep doing is naming and shaming, picking off bad employers one by one so that others think they might be next. It may not be the village green stocks. But it’s still pretty medieval. No wonder restaurants weren’t a thing back then.
The Netherlands has found a solution to the problem of car doors and cyclists (Transport secretary knocks man off his bike, 16 December). Dutch motorists are trained to open the car door with their opposite hand. This forces the body to swivel, and your eyes to look backward, thus spotting a passing cyclist. Drivers must demonstrate this to pass the driving test. It is referred to sometimes as the “Dutch reach”. In the Netherlands it is simply called how you open your car door.

The London gin maker Sipsmith has been swallowed up by Beam Suntory, the world’s third-largest spirits company, as it tries to tap into surging demand for handcrafted tipples.
The Japanese owner of Jim Beam, Maker’s Mark, Teacher’s and Courvoisier is thought to have paid as much as £50m to buy out Sipsmith’s shareholders, including Sam Galsworthy and Fairfax Hall, who founded the brand with Jared Brown just eight years ago.
All three will be staying on to run the business, which has 35 staff and will continue to be run out of its traditional copper pot distillery in Chiswick, west London.
Galsworthy said Sipsmith already sold 30% of its gin overseas and demand was “growing like billyo” in the US, Australia and northern Europe as well as Japan. He said teaming up with Beam Suntory would help the company achieve its aim of building a lasting brand.
“We have worked tirelessly to share our gin of the highest quality with discerning sippers,” said Galsworthy. “In this new chapter, we have found the perfect partners to take Sipsmith to all four corners of the globe.”
Sipsmith is one of hundreds of artisanal distillers set up in recent years amid a growing trend towards smaller brands with an authentic backstory. It claims to have pioneered a gin renaissance in London by starting up the city’s first copper distillery for nearly 200 years.
Sipsmith’s sales have risen by between 60% and 70% a year for the past two years as Brits have been quaffing gin in record amounts. This year 40m bottles were bought as a 19% rise in sales outstripped growth in sparkling wine, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA).
That is part of an international trend that has led to gin exports rising at record levels. Sales to the US alone have soared 553% in the past decade, reaching £159m in 2015.
Jonny Forsyth, global drinks analyst at the market analysts Mintel, said it was no surprise that Beam Suntory had bought Sipsmith as the major spirits producers recognised they faced a challenge from fast-growing craft brands.
“Millennial consumers, in particular, really value small-batch heritage spirit brands rather than big brands with a more mainstream audience. It is a lot like the craft beer where we’ve seen big brands say ‘it’s time we bought these brands before they become big competition’.”
He said the buyout of the craft gin distiller Monkey 47 by Pernod Ricard in January marked the beginning of a trend that was likely to escalate, although there were few craft gin makers who have reached any serious scale.
Forsyth said major spirit companies were moving to buy out producers at a relatively early stage in their development, after letting craft beer startups gain market share before they began buying them up.
But he added: “It’s a risky thing to do as the younger consumer really demands authenticity from a brand. Sipsmith is still playing on its craft and smaller size and there’s a real disconnect with being part of one of the major spirits companies in the world.”
Galsworthy said he was confident that Beam Suntory would give the brand real independence and it would continue to produce its gin in exactly the same manner. He said he was “committed for life” to Sipsmith and while the current staff and founding shareholders, who include family and friends, would no longer hold shares in the company they had agreed long-term financial incentives so they could share in its future success.
Matt Shattock, chairman and chief executive of Beam Suntory, said: “We really admire what [Sipsmith has] accomplished, and we’re very excited to team up with them to maximise the global potential of Sipsmith.”
Gin is thought to have been first produced in Italy, but gained popularity as a medicine in early 17th-century Holland.
“Genever” was used a treatment for stomach complaints, gout and gallstones. It was flavoured with juniper to improve the taste and add medicinal properties.
Gin was popularised in the UK via British troops who were given the spirit as “Dutch courage” during the 30 years’ war. But the industry really boomed in the early 1700s after King William III loosened regulation.
Gin became so widely consumed that the amount sold daily began to exceed that of beer. It was a cheap drink drunk by the poor.
Attempts to control the market in the 1730s led to riots and failed to put a lid on growing sales. In 1750 the Gin Act finally restricted distribution by licensing spirit retailers. Hogarth’s famous print Gin Lane, produced in 1751, showed the dangers of addiction to the spirit.
Gin’s image first began to change in the 1850s when distillers opened gin palaces, luxurious drinking establishments designed to entice more well-off patrons. The gin and tonic was also born as Brits in colonial India mixed the spirit with sugar and lime to make taking quinine for malaria more palatable. Gin reached the peak of sophistication when mixed with vermouth to create the martini cocktail, chosen by Ian Fleming as the drink of choice – with vodka and shaken, not stirred – for James Bond .
Two weeks ago, he was a chicken fan with a tiny YouTube following. Now, he has a manager, millions of fans and a secret plan for world domination. But the Chicken Connoisseur has zero appetite for discussing his age. Is he a teenager, as many assumed when his video reviews of London chicken shops went viral last week? With boyish features and dressed in his Sunday best, the then-unnamed critic attracted millions of hits. But then, in a tweeted – and now deleted – reply to the question of age, he said he was 23.
“I don’t really see that there’s much of a need to confirm it,” says Elijah Quashie, in a phone interview arranged by his manager and old friend Marwan Elgamal. Quashie is promoting episode seven of Pengest Munch, which you can watch below, in which the Chicken Connoisseur goes to North Finchley. “To be honest, I can’t remember what I tweeted or didn’t tweet – a lot’s been going on,” he says.
Quashie, from Tottenham, north London, realised things were exploding when his phone started buzzing while he sat on a train. Until a little over a week ago, his videos had about 700 views each. His YouTube channel, which he started in August 2015, had 150 subscribers. At the time of writing, the videos now have about a million views each and the channel almost a quarter of a million subscribers.
“My head is still spinning,” Quashie says. “Before, I might have had a lie-in, take my time and go and make some jam and peanut butter sandwiches. Now it’s this interview, or this thing. It’s been hectic. But it’s kind of what I wanted, just not necessarily at this scale.”
Quashie attributes his unexpected fame to “the bald one on MasterChef”. Last year, he was idly watching Gregg Wallace judging a plate of food. “I wondered to myself, what makes his opinion more valued than anyone else’s? Is it because he’s been eating more food, so he has an experienced palate? I’m not sure. I thought, no one is doing this for the type of people who eat at chicken shops.”
Chicken shops have become integral to communities across our cities. “This isn’t me being cliched, but I genuinely don’t know what life would be like without them,” Quashie says. “When I link up with my friends, we go to the chicken shop and eat and chill. If not there, we might end up going to someone’s house but then someone has to cook and it’s a bit long.”
Quashie, who has always been the class joker, is unimpressed by the more recent rise of high-end pretenders, including Chicken Shop, the Soho House chain. “If I want to spend £10 on chicken, I’ll go to my local bossman and feed five people,” he says. For Quashie, shops live or die by price, but he says that lighting and seating arrangements are also vital. “These things affect the mood of the place,” he adds.
The suits he wears while reviewing (typical line: “The burger caught me off-guard, ’cos it was hench … man definitely chewed on a bone”) are his church clothes. “I thought it was funny, because people might demean chicken shops,” Quashie says, “but it’s just as much a restaurant.”
The videos, made by Elishama Udorok, a filmmaker friend of Quashie’s, went viral when the sixth episode took off on Reddit and Twitter. Now Quashie, a former shoe-shop worker with a collection of 40 pairs of rare trainers, is getting recognised on the street. Recently, he says, a paramedic shouted at him from an ambulance, insisting that his local Chick-King could not be matched.
Quashie tries to limit chicken shop meals to one or two a week. “Before this thing blew up, I was thinking I might need to cut down to get my diet on point, but now …” he says. “But most of the time I’m eating jollof rice or a bit of plantain.” He also has plans to leverage his burgeoning fame into a new project. As to what that might be, though, he wants to keep fans guessing. “We’re talking about expensive intellectual property, so I will keep it under wraps,” he says.
The Christmas countdown has started, and to avoid the usual last-minute fluster, I’m trying to plan ahead. Knowing what we’re going to eat next weekend and beyond means I can get some cooking done early. It also limits panic buys: every year, I never think we have enough food in, but there’s always way too much. I’m making this comforting and inexpensive Persian rice for Christmas Eve, most of which can be made ahead; and a light salad for the evening after the big lunch.
This is the type of dish you can eat with a spoon while curled up in a heap or when celebrating around a crowded table. Serves four to six.
6 medium-sized squid
100g brown lentils
200g basmati rice, soaked for 1 hour
6 tbsp olive oil
2 small white onions, peeled and finely chopped
80g sultanas, soaked in boiling water for 10 minutes
1 tsp turmeric
1 stick cinnamon
1 pinch saffron threads, soaked in 100ml warm water
For the onions
150ml vegetable oil
2 white onions, peeled and finely sliced
For the dressing
1 orange
1 lemon
½ small bunch parsley, leaves picked and finely chopped
1 small bunch dill, finely chopped
1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
Cut down one side of each squid and open it out. Scrape out any gunk, then wash. Score the inside surface in a criss-cross pattern, but don’t cut all the way through, then refrigerate.
Warm the oil for the onions in a deep pan (or wok) on a medium-low heat, and sweat the onions, stirring often, for 30-40 minutes, until golden and crisp. Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper.
Put the lentils and rice in separate small pans, cover both with water, season with salt and bring to a boil. Cook the rice for 10 minutes, drain and leave uncovered to steam dry. Let the lentils cook for 10-15 minutes longer, until just cooked, then drain and steam dry in the same way.
Warm half the olive oil in a casserole and sweat the chopped onions on medium heat for 10 minutes, until soft. Add the sultanas, turmeric and cinnamon, cook for five minutes, then stir into the lentils.
For the dressing, grate the orange and lemon zest into a bowl, then add the onion mix and the herbs. Cut off and discard the lemon pith, roughly chop the flesh, stir this into the salad mix, and season to taste. This can all be done ahead of time.
Just before serving, wipe clean the casserole, add the remaining oil and put on a medium heat. Spoon in half the rice in an even layer, then top with half the lentils, and repeat until both are used up. Poke holes all over the top layer of lentils, and pour the saffron water into the indents. Cover the pan with a clean tea towel and a lid, pulling the towel up and over the lid, to keep it away from the heat source, and cook on a medium heat for 25 minutes, until the bottom layer of rice is golden and crisp.
Five minutes before the rice is done, heat a griddle until smoking hot. Rub the squid in a little oil, salt and pepper, then lay it unscored side down on the griddle, pressing it flat with a fish slice. Cook for a minute a side, then cut into big chunks.
Spoon the rice and lentils on to a platter, scraping the bottom to get all those lovely crunchy bits. Scatter over the squid, spoon on the dressing and top with the onions. Serve hot.
Grilling gives the pears a lovely smokiness, while the dressing adds a sparkling acidity. Serves four to six.
1 small shallot, peeled and finely sliced
2 tbsp sherry vinegar
4 firm pears, cut lengthways into 2cm slices
50g blue cheese (gorgonzola or stilton)
Juice of 1 small lemon
2 tsp creme fraiche
2-3 sprigs tarragon, leaves picked and finely chopped
5 tbsp olive oil
300g radicchio, chicory and watercress leaves, washed and dried
Put the shallot and vinegar in a small bowl, stir and leave to macerate while you get on with the everything else.
Heat a griddle until smoking hot (or heat a grill to its highest setting), then grill the pear slices for two to three minutes a side, until lightly charred, but not cooking them so much that the fruit falls apart. Set aside to cool.
Meanwhile, put the nuts, sugar, pimentón and butter in a small saucepan on a medium-high heat and cook, stirring, for five minutes until the butter and sugar have melted and coated the nuts. Tip out on to a plate covered in greaseproof paper, and separate the nuts a little, so they don’t stick together too much as they cool.
For the dressing, mash the cheese and lemon with a fork, until smoothish, stir in the creme fraiche and tarragon, then slowly whisk in the oil until emulsified and thick. Season to taste. Rip the leaves into random shapes and sizes, and arrange on a platter. Sit the pears on top, followed by the shallots. Break up the nuts with your hands, sprinkle all over the top, then spoon on the dressing and serve at once.
If, like me, you over-order blue cheese at Christmas, don’t worry. Beaten into an equal amount of mascarpone, it makes a glorious filling for mini cheese scones. Or add some to a rarebit mixture made with strong cheddar or Lincolnshire poacher, for the perfect simple and quick supper. Or use it up in a cheese soufflé. Whizz leftover tarragon with parsley to make a fast salsa verde. And sprinkle excess crisp onions on just about anything.
Soju, the world’s bestselling alcohol, is a rice-based Korean hooch that packs a fair punch. That said, it is almost Christmas, so you could use St Germain instead of the cordial to make this even boozier. Serves one.
Shake the soju, cordial, Cointreau, citrus and egg in a shaker, add ice and shake again. Strain into a coupe glass, add a drop of bitters and serve.
What’s going for it? Those wily French! No sooner had they stormed the Bastille than they had designs on storming us. Again. The last invasion of Britain took place on 22 February 1797, just outside Fishguard, though it seems more omnishambles than shock and awe. Two of the three prongs of attack were scuppered by bad weather; the third was marred by a right old shower. Many opted to get drunk and loot farmhouses; the rest were seen off after a couple of days by reservists and locals, including folk heroine Jemima Nicholas who, it’s reputed, rounded up a dozen Frenchies with nothing more than a pitchfork. That’s the spirit. After which Fishguard and its mini-me Newport returned to business as usual, catching herring and supping ale. Today, they’re rather idyllic, with their boats bobbing in the harbour, their wooded slopes and tranquil beaches, while tourists and downshifters hungry for the Pembrokeshire Experience invade Tenby and the south coast, armed with selfie sticks and demands for artisan ice-cream.
The case against They’re remote, but that kind of goes with the territory.
Well connected? There’s a station, but few trains: three a day to Carmarthen (50 mins), a couple of direct trains a day to Cardiff (2-3hrs). Driving: half-hour drives to Haverfordwest and St David’s, an hour to Carmarthen, 90 mins to Swansea. Buses to Haverfordwest, Cardigan and St David’s.
Schools Primaries: Fishguard’s Glannau Gwaun and Holy Name Catholic are “adequate”, Newport’s Bro Ingli is “good”, Estyn says. Secondaries: Fishguard’s Bro Gwaun is “adequate”.
Hang out at… Cnapan or the Golden Lion, both in Newport; the Fishguard Arms or the Royal Oak in Fishguard, where the Frenchies got drunk.
Where to buy Fishguard is a game of three halves: the pretty Lower Town down on the harbour, all wooded slopes, pebbledashed cottages, slipways and seaweed; the main town up the hill, with fine sea views, whitewashed or brightly painted town houses and terraces; and Goodwick, home to the ferry and train station, and a more humdrum affair. Newport, on the other side of Dinas Head, is smaller and quieter, straggly with old stone houses tumbling to the beach. Large detacheds and town houses, £300,000-£400,000. Detacheds and smaller town houses, £150,000-£300,000. Semis, £110,000-£250,000. Terraces and cottages, £80,000-£125,000. The rental market is teeny.
Phil Rowson “The Cambo pub, short for Cambrian: a proper local for young and old, families, regulars and drop-ins.”
Angela Griffiths “The Gourmet Pig deli for Welsh cheeses, wines and beer – they serve great coffee, too. The Royal Oak pub has a fantastic folk night every Tuesday.”

A group of British modelling agencies that represent names including Yasmin Le Bon, Sophie Dahl and Stella Tennant have been fined £1.5m for colluding to fix prices charged to retailers, fashion brands and other customers.
The UK competition regulator has fined FM Models, Models 1, Premier, Storm and Viva, along with industry trade body the Association of Model Agents (AMA), for price-fixing modelling services for at least two years from March 2013.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that the agencies and their association “systematically exchanged information and discussed prices”, in some cases agreeing to fix minimum prices or agree a common approach to pricing.
The price collusion affected customers including high street chains, online fashion retailers and consumer goods brands that use models to front their products and appear in ad campaigns.
The regulator’s investigation looked into pricing practices across a broad spectrum of modelling assignments, from fashion magazine shoots offering models fees of a few hundred pounds to ad campaigns offering more than £10,000.
The CMA said that the collusion and price fixing did not extend to the services of so-called “top models”.
The fine and ruling is hugely damaging to the reputation of the modelling agencies and their industry. Premier represented Naomi Campbell for 17 years, while Storm discovered Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne, although all three are now with other agencies. Models 1 represents Sophie Dahl and Yasmin Le Bon, while Viva’s models include Stella Tennant and Natalia Vodianova.
The two biggest fines were charged to Storm (£491,000) and Models One (£394,000). FM Models, which has been given a £251,00 fine, shut down earlier this year.
Models 1, Premier and Storm said in a joint statement that they intended to appeal against the ruling. “The CMA’s findings are wholly mistaken,” the agencies said.
The agencies said the CMA has failed to understand the role of the modelling agency, which is in part to protect the interests of models. They said their actions were not designed to force up or fix prices but to “protect the interests of models and also ensure a sustainable market which benefits customers, the economy and society”.
“We reached our decision to appeal the CMA’s findings without hesitation,” said John Horner, the managing director of Models 1. “The CMA is penalising modelling agencies for seeking to maintain professional standards within the industry whilst also protecting the interests of young and vulnerable people.”
Le Bon credited the AMA with “nurturing and protecting” her at the beginning of her career and said it “taught [me] how to become the model I am today”.
“Had it not been for the knowledge, experience and professionalism of the agency I would not have sustained a career in the industry,” she said. “It takes time and commitment to build a career and the AMA, with its agents, have always sought to protect young models from exploitation, but also from clients who are under pressure to pay increasingly low fees.”
Storm model Hannah Cassidy said the AMA’s guidance had been “essential because the pressure and dangers of exploitation are real”.
“I have benefited from their experience in negotiating rates, working conditions, terms and image use,” she said. “Agents promote but also protect models from unfair contract and exclusivity terms which could harm their careers. They also make sure I get paid on time.”
Viva, which was fined £245,000, also strenuously denies wrongdoing.
“Viva strongly denies it agreed to fix minimum prices or that it agreed a common approach to pricing,” said a spokeswoman for the agency. “To date, the CMA has produced no evidence to demonstrate that the conduct which is the subject of the CMA’s Decision had any effect on the rates models represented by Viva received for assignments; this is because it did not have any such effect.”
The CMA said that the AMA and the agencies also sought to influence other members of the industry body by regularly issuing email circulars, known as AMA Alerts, urging them to resist the prices offered by customers on the grounds they were too low.
“When businesses collude rather than compete the ultimate losers are customers,” said John Wotton, the chair of the Case Decision Group at the CMA, which made the decision. “This type of behaviour harms the economy and deprives businesses and consumers of the benefits of competition.”

Could having fun in middle age help you live longer? A study from University College London, tracking 9,000 people over four years, has found that enjoying life and having a positive outlook in your 50s is linked to longevity. We asked people over 50 how they keep their happiness levels up.
Deb: Doing things separately away from family is good. Having lots of grown-up girly time. Now our children are grown up, it’s easier to fit in socialising. We get together at the weekends and sleep over. Our families benefit because we’re happy – we have free time away from them and we go home relaxed. It’s good to get away from normal day-to-day routine, just being ourselves. I forget how old I am. I definitely have more fun now than I did when I was 20 or 30. My life seems fuller, a better quality of life. Sometimes it is hard to keep in touch with friends. But you have to make time, and take the time out.
Sally: I love my allotment, which I’ve had for about five years. It’s fresh air, and I love the view. It’s quiet and peaceful – it’s “my time”. Friends and family are important. We have a friend who has MS and it makes us realise what we can do and she can’t anymore.
Julie: Days meeting up with friends make me happy. We’ve had the most wonderful time, reliving our teenage years! We went to see the Bay City Rollers, our 1970s heroes – we’ve seen them three times. Such good fun. It takes us back. I have more fun now. Back then you worried about how you looked, but now you’re just relaxed.
Stephen: I’ve just taken six months unpaid leave to go out and start trying to enjoy things. It’s like a pre-retirement, to get used to it. And to spend more time as a couple, doing things we enjoy. We took the whole family – our three children, their partners and our grandchild – on holiday to Florida. We spent a week in Disneyland and a week on the coast. And now we’re planning our next holiday in Malaysia.
Loraine: My family is key to my happiness. My granddaughter is just so gorgeous. I used to look after her for one day a week because everyone was at work. I haven’t changed that much now I’m older. I don’t go out to discos now, but I do still like to dance. I’m looking forward to Steve retiring, as I’ve been home alone for three years.
I’ve got four kids, who I brought up myself, and five grandchildren. They’re my joy. For fun, I love travelling, and I’ve been to amazing places. I was really happy when I walked the Great Wall of China.
London’s tough. It’s a hard city to live in. My balance is going back to Sheffield and seeing my kids – then I’m happy. And no, I’m not worried about smoking. You’re going to die from something, right?
I stay happy playing cricket, watching cricket, or playing football. I think friendly competition gives me happiness. The same things that got me going in my youth keep me going now: achievement in sport, but also in work.
In work it’s winning research grants and consultant contracts, and publishing a good paper that’s well read gives me a kick. I think if you follow what you’re good at and what you enjoy doing, and make that your career, then you’re having fun and getting paid for it.
As I’ve got older, I’ve learned that mood has much more to do with the machine of your body rather than how you think. If you get the sun on your skin, talk to another human being, use your body and wear it out a bit each day, eat good food and sleep, I think it’s impossible to feel depressed. I live on a boat and so I spend a lot of my life sitting outside. And because I run a bookshop from it, I spend a lot of my time talking to other people.
Most of my socialising and having fun when I was younger was a way to meet girls. When your testosterone levels calm a little bit, it’s like like the sun falls and all the stars become visible. Softer things like live music and reading books seem to be immensely pleasing things. The most fun I have is with the guy I run the bookshop with. Having a creative thing to do with someone else is another secret of happiness, because there’s always someone to motivate you when you’re feeling flat.
I will be 28 at the end of this year, and I am feeling very anxious about the next stage of my life.
I am generally very sociable, and have built a wide circle of friends. However, lately, I have found that many of my friends are in committed, settled relationships, and I worry that I have nothing in common with my peers any more. I am grateful to have had three romantic relationships in my 20s, although none of these have worked out. I have considered dating, but I find that a lot of men my age and older are more interested in women who are in their early 20s. This has surprised me and made me feel insecure about searching for a partner.
I lived in a different city when I went to university, and I have been lucky to have visited several countries all over the world throughout my life, but now I am working in a career in the city I was born in, and I feel very restless and unmotivated. I have considered moving abroad, but I am lucky to have the job that I have and I am not sure it would be productive to leave it.
I am also concerned that I would face the same challenges abroad, such as having things in common with peers who are in settled relationships. I am not sure that I am happy with the way that my life has gone over the past decade, and I am worried it is too late to do anything meaningful or exciting. I can appreciate that I have my health and that I have a lot of life left to live, but I can’t shake this feeling of dread and anxiety about what is coming next.
It’s not uncommon when friends go through stages you are not sharing with them (new job, relationships, new baby, etc) to feel a bit adrift, left out, left behind – no one likes this feeling. And I think your 20s is when this happens a lot, and it can leave you feeling really disoriented. But unless the friendship is very transient (and some friendships are, but that doesn’t mean they’re not valuable for the time they last), you should be able to meet one another on the other side. After all, you will one day go through a life stage that your friends aren’t going through and they may feel like this. What’s important is to look for the landmarks of similarity, rather than where you diverge.
I consulted Andy Cottom, a psychotherapist (ukcp.org.uk), who wonders “who made up the rules that you’re trying to follow? The expectations of stages in life: school, university, buy a house, settle down? You seem to be at a stage where your friends are settling down, but perhaps you don’t want to?”
If I were to tell you that, actually, you will get all the things you want (whatever they are) later, what would you do with this stage of your life? Of course, I can’t guarantee anything, but it’s a useful exercise to think like this. Because if you could be sure you would, for example, settle down (this is the thing you seem to have mentioned the most, that other people are doing and you are not) – how would you view this period in your life now? Would you not, actually, be able to enjoy the freedom and independence more, instead of worrying about what will happen next. Are you not, perhaps, more worried and anxious about what won’t happen, rather than what is happening?
You mention being back in the city you were born in – was that a fall-back decision or a positive one? You present this as if it were a step backwards, as if everyone else is moving forward but you are not. I don’t think that’s accurate because you are not comparing like with like. Can you pinpoint why you are unmotivated? Did you feel unmotivated before “all your friends started settling down” – have their choices made you look more acutely on your own? It is hard not to be swayed by what’s happening around you but I wonder what grounds you? (Family? No mention of them.)
If you could tap more into what makes you feel safe – in this period of what you feel to be instability – it might give you a chance to zone into what it is that you really want. Maybe moving cities and jobs is the right thing to do, but you should do it because you want to, because it’s right for you – not as a reaction to what is happening with your friends.
Did something particular trigger this feeling of dread and anxiety? Can you trace it back to a particular event and, if so, could you examine what this represents to you?
You know, there may be someone in your circle right now looking at you and thinking how much you’ve got going for you, because nothing is ever as it seems and all those people around you who seem to have it so sorted – they haven’t. You are not quite 28; you say yourself that you have a lot of life left to live – you do! You have the whole of the rest of your life to do something “meaningful and exciting” or just meaningful and very ordinary, if that’s what you choose to do.
Cottom advises you to “have more confidence in your abilities. Don’t be frightened by the freedom you have.”

At what age are you too old to achieve breakthrough success in your field? That question fascinates so many people, I suspect, because almost nobody considers themselves already entirely successful. The unpublished novelist longs to be published, the published one yearns for bestsellerdom, the bestselling superstar craves the Booker prize. (Also, everyone always thinks they’re just a few years from being “over the hill”. The web is cluttered with listicles offering the supposedly reassuring information that, say, JK Rowling wasn’t a publishing sensation until, well, her early 30s.)
But a huge new study, examining the careers of nearly 3,000 physicists from 1893 on, reaches an unexpected result. It’s not that youth wins out, nor that years of experience lead to late triumphs. Rather, age just isn’t much of a factor. A physicist’s highest-impact work “could be the first publication, mid-career, or last publication”. What counted more was productivity. If you want to publish a celebrated physics paper, the crucial thing isn’t to be young and energetic, nor old and wise. It’s to publish a lot of papers.
To be fair, other studies show age does matter sometimes: maths favours the young; and physical pursuits, such as ballet or athletics, aren’t exactly welcoming to the achy-kneed. Personality also influences the age at which success strikes. The economist David Galenson splits creative geniuses into “conceptual” prodigies such as Picasso – who burst on to the scene with a radical new viewpoint – and “experimental” ones such as Cézanne, whose brilliance emerges through trial and error. (In his podcast Revisionist History, Malcolm Gladwell applies the Cézanne model to Leonard Cohen’s song Hallelujah, which sounds as if it popped into existence as a perfect gem, yet went through years of being turgid.) But even Galenson’s work implies age matters little. He once polled literary scholars to make a list of America’s 11 most important poems, then looked up the ages at which they’d been composed: a wide span, from 23 to 59.
We’re back in the world of the “focusing illusion”, whereby we exaggerate the importance of one variable (in this case, age) merely by thinking about it lots. Something similar happens in romance: we fret about whether partners should have similar personalities, or whether opposites attract – when in fact, psychologists argue, neither plays a big role in predicting relationship success.
Then there’s childrearing. As a new parent (of which more, doubtless, in future columns), I’ve been buffeted by endless contradictory advice on what works, so I was pleased to stumble across Do Parents Matter?, a new book by Robert and Sarah LeVine. On all sorts of fractious debates (sleep training, attachment parenting) they show how neither side holds the key: cultures around the world take every kind of approach, and most kids turn out OK. In short: you’re probably not too old to find success. You don’t need to worry about “romantic compatibility”. And your parenting style probably won’t end in disaster – though that last one might be wishful thinking on my part.
Len Goodman is waltzing off into the Strictly Come Dancing sunset after this Saturday’s grand final, no doubt with a perfectly executed heel lead. At the age of 72 and following 14 seasons as Strictly’s head judge, Len has decided it’s time to lay down his scoring paddle and rest his dancing feet.
Even though Goodman and his fellow male judges Bruno Tonioli and Craig Revel-Horwood have been part of the panel since Strictly’s launch in 2004, it’s head judge Len who has secured his place in the nation’s hearts as the cheeky, twinkly-eyed uncle of the show, keeping the mood light with his pickle-me-walnuts charm and joyful scattering of metaphors. Who can forget: “You flew across the floor like a rampant crab” in response to Anita Rani and Gleb Savchenko’s 2015 American smooth?
Goodman took up ballroom dancing aged 19, after a short career as a welder, then turned professional in his 20s and went on to win the British Exhibition Championships four times with his partner and first wife, Cherry. He’s a stickler for proper ballroom and Latin techniques, with limited patience for a disco salsa or a hip-hop samba. If one of the Strictly professional dancers sneaked an illegal lift into their routine, there was a good chance Len would call them out on it; a reminder that competitive ballroom dancing has rules, and the choreographers ignore them at their peril.
For me, a score of “SEVERRRRN” should always be bellowed in an exaggerated fashion; it doesn’t feel right any other way. The show is better for Len’s 50 years of dance experience and kindly encouragement of beginners, not to mention his gritted-teeth recoiling from Bruno’s deranged arm-waving. It might be part panto, but there’s also an element of genuine exasperation at having his personal space invaded every few minutes, and it’s as much part of the Strictly furniture as a “Ten from Len”.
But that’s not to say there haven’t been a few sticky turns in Len’s judging routine; in recent years he has become increasingly cantankerous, perhaps due to the punishing schedule of weekly flights to LA to judge the US Strictly spin-off, Dancing with the Stars, and the pressure of maintaining his avuncular persona after 14 years in the ever-brightening Strictly spotlight.
The delivery of his preprepared comments has become more laboured, and the spats with fellow judges, pro dancers and even the celebrity contestants more frequent; this year’s headline-grabber was Len suggesting singer Will Young “turn up, keep up and shut up” after Young pushed back on Len’s critique of his Bollywood salsa – a reminder that Len still has all his own teeth, and isn’t afraid to use them.
But while the time may be right for Goodman to swap his Cuban heels for fireside slippers, there’s no doubt he is going to be a tough act to follow. Marianka Swain, arts journalist and Dancing Times’ Strictly blogger, agrees: “Strictly’s biggest triumph – and continuing challenge – is balancing ballroom and entertainment, making a show with dance integrity that’s also accessible to millions of Saturday night TV viewers. Len Goodman was a key part of that success, and the BBC will need to cast his successor with enormous care”.
The BBC are staying quiet on Len’s replacement for now, presumably to let him have his final moments in the Strictly spotlight before a new judge makes a big entrance. Bring a hanky for Saturday night’s Grand Final… it’s going to be emotional.

The wetsuit designed to make him invisible to sharks appears to have worked – but a British man has nevertheless had to call off his bid to become the first to swim the breadth of the Atlantic Ocean after bad weather severely damaged his support vessel.
Ben Hooper, a 38-year-old father and former police officer from Gloucestershire with a deceptively languid-looking front crawl, set off from Senegal 33 days ago and was aiming to reach the coastline of Brazil sometime in March.
But on Friday he admitted defeat – for the time being at least – after his support vessel, the Big Blue, was bashed about by terrible weather and high waves.
In a statement on his Facebook page, Hooper said: “We were subjected to our fifth day of Atlantic storms as a result of which the sailing catamaran Big Blue suffered damage to her steering and rigging.
“The crew worked through the night to make the vessel safe for all onboard and we were able to assess the extent of the damage and the impact on the expedition at first light.”
Emergency repairs were made that means she can continue to sail towards Brazil but the damage had led the team to “reappraise” the expedition.
It had by no means been an easy trip thus far. The sharks may have been flummoxed but Hooper was injured by another marine beast – a Portuguese man-of-war jellyfish that left him incapacitated in the water.
Big Blue picked him up but the fear was that further damage to the boat’s steering might have made it harder to reach him quickly if there was another emergency.
Hooper said: “I would add that we are all safe and that Big Blue remains seaworthy and capable of completing crossing of the Atlantic Ocean during the months of December and January.”
Much of Hooper’s training had taken place in a swimming pool in Cheltenham, where the sight of him ploughing up and down became a familiar one to fellow swimmers and staff.
He also trained in open water in Florida and in the Mediterranean, notching up 7,450 miles (12,000km) of training in pool and ocean.
Such is his attention to detail that he worked with Hartpury College in Gloucestershire to find out what music – played on a waterproof MP3 player – helped him most.
It turned out that if he listened to Eminem his performance was bolstered by up to 10%, though he leavened the American rapper with tunes by the Prodigy and Faithless.
The swimwear specialist Arena designed a Sams (shark attack mitigation systems) wetsuit with Hooper in mind. It features a camouflage print that apparently makes the wearer harder for sharks to spot.
Hooper was aiming to cover 2,000 miles. By the time he called a halt he had completed 87 miles in 33 days. Fifteen days had been lost to weather, medical problems and issues with the boat.
He remains determined to try again.
“My attempt to become the first person to swim across the Atlantic Ocean – every single mile – remains but it has been postponed for the time being,” he said.
“My crew have worked tirelessly to make this possible and this decision has not been taken lightly; indeed, the easy option would have been to carry on at all costs. That would have been foolhardy and unnecessary.
“To quote Theodore Roosevelt, ‘It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed.’ We have not failed; we have achieved and gained the knowledge to succeed in the future.”
All-male panels are a particularly emotive subject for me. I’ve written about them and I follow the #allmalepanel hashtag for updates on the topic. But recently I’ve noticed three developments that add more nuances to the debate on gender and panel diversity – and more broadly on how we meet and talk. I’ve also noticed that three new academic articles have been published in the International Feminist Journal of Politics.
Even though this requires a bit more research, it really seems that seven has become some kind of magic number.
Maybe people only share panels with a particularly large number of men, but in general I have a gut feeling that panels seem to grow in different surroundings such as academia, policy and other public events. So even if we assume that these panels could be more diverse, that does not answer the more strategic question: “What do you expect from a six, seven or eight-person panel? Even if everybody only speaks for five minutes and you add a little time for transitions or Q&A that automatically turns a seven-person panel into an hour-long affair. So you may well have invited seven people to get five-10 minutes out of them. Even if they do other things at the conference or speak on a second panel it still looks like showing off and dropping names for the sake of it.
In addition to actual panels, a lot of roundtables are also shared under #allmalepanel. Often in connection with EU policy-making, these images come with a context of how policy-making “takes place” in poorly-lit conference rooms, or traditional, masculine rooms with flags and wood-panelling. 
Chair next to chair, men sit around big tables, no breathing space in their suits, nothing that provides inspiration in the room – it is hard to imagine how this provides a space for “thinking outside the box” or finding innovative solutions to the complex worldwide problems.
Here they sit on a stage...
And here they are in different kinds of suits...
The German sustainability award spent quite a lot of time on Twitter to convince critics that a picture with 17 men was not all that bad – “It’s not the men who were awarded prices – they are just representatives for 17 amazing projects”. Be that as it may, 17 men representing projects from the private and public sectors are still quite telling. As long as the bosses, supervisors or project leaders are all male we need to discuss structural issues, and not just responding with the “maybe more women can apply next year” line.
And even though this hardly warrants a reply any more, there is the “I’d rather see qualified people on the panel even if it makes them less diverse” line. I do not doubt that many of the men on the panels are qualified, but as I point out regularly, the question is not about some artificial quota, but about diversity of opinions and the visible gender binaries are only one aspect of many others.
In most cases, the organisations, forums and organisers that are pointed out via the #allmalepanel hashtag do not respond, let alone engage in a discussion on how to avoid #allmalepanel in the future. Some conference organisers make promises, but the mega-conferencing industry is already such a flawed enterprise that simply adding more women will hardly change produce better annual meetings of some association or other.
How can we create more diverse and creative spaces for exchanges that can break at least some of the rituals of how we get together? As with most behaviour, change initiatives it starts with us. Owen Barder’s pledge to never appear on an all-male panel is important, but maybe we need to go further and pledge to attend fewer panels in general, fewer conferences in global chain hotels, fewer meetings in traditional spaces and more meetings that are family or pet-friendly and that generally are organised in a more thoughtful way other than giving business to the conference facility and schedule three coffee breaks.
The routine for the Benedictine monks of Buckfast Abbey in Devon is plain and strict: a bell rings at 5.25am to wake them and thereafter the day is divided into periods of prayer, work and study. Meals are simple and, except on very special occasions, taken in silence.
Yet there is nothing austere about the finances of the Buckfast Abbey trust, which supports the community. New figures from the Charity Commission reveal that – in large part thanks to the success of the abbey’s tonic wine – the trust’s annual income totalled a cool £8.8m.
The success is not without controversy. Buckfast tonic wine, which contains caffeine, is often blamed for drink-fuelled thuggery in Scotland. Only last week a sheriff in Dundee said he believed there was a “very definite association between Buckfast and violence” as he sentenced a young man who smashed a bottle of the drink over a boy’s head at a child’s 15th birthday party.
Such trouble does not tend to happen in Buckfastleigh. “I don’t know anyone who really drinks it here, actually, and certainly not as apparently as some do in Strathclyde,” said Neil Smith, a town councillor and economics lecturer. “Although it does actually make quite a nice alternative to Pimm’s if you dilute it with lemonade rather than down it in one from the bottle.”
Smith does not feel the drink’s reputation is bad for the town’s image. “On the contrary, it generates interest in the town and the long history of the abbey here. The abbey is a huge tourist attraction, bringing people from all over the world. It employs local people; it is a beautiful environment with free entry, providing a space to walk and contemplate. I go there often myself, despite not being religious.”
The postmaster, Lorraine Lee, is also a fan of the abbey. When the post office relocated last year, the trust paid for the refurbishment. “They do very good work in the town,” said Lee. Did she like the tonic wine? “I’ve tasted it but it’s not my cup of tea.”
It is clear from the townspeople – and the financial accounts – that the monks do not hoard the money. As well as investing in the post office, they have recently ploughed funds into a play park. They also support religious ventures such as a Catholic theological school.
The recipe for the tonic wine is attributed to the original French monks who settled at the abbey in the 1880s. They imported base wines from Spain, added ingredients according to a secret, age-old recipe and created a medicinal pick-me-up.
By the 1920s, 1,400 bottles were being sold annually and the distribution and sale was taken over by a company called J Chandler, based in Hampshire. To broaden its appeal, Buckfast was made less severe and turned into what the abbey describes as a “smoother, more mature medicated wine”.
It used to be advertised as a cure for insomnia and was said to have “wonderful restorative and health-giving properties”. In more modern times, the label has been adapted to include the proviso: “The name tonic wine does not imply health-giving or medicinal properties.”
But it is still selling well. Today Buckfast is exported to Australia, the Bahamas, Spain, Greece, Ireland and to parts of west Africa.
The monks have expanded the operation, recently building a new tonic factory – a low-lying building with a grass roof – with four vats each with a capacity of 130,000 litres of wine.
Despite its worldwide sales, Buckfast is not available at all outlets in Buckfastleigh. The Abbey Inn, a pub on the bank of the Dart, does not stock the wine. “It’s an acquired taste – very sweet,” said the landlord, Richard Jacobsen. “I think they export most of it up to Glasgow. We don’t get asked for it. Cider is more what we do here.”
The monks seem a little reluctant to discuss either the trust’s comfortable financial position or the alleged problems the drink causes. This week Chalk & Ward, a PR company based in Exeter, was tasked with getting the abbey’s message across.
It explained in a statement that selling tonic wine was not about making a stack of cash. “Buckfast Abbey’s charitable trust exists to support the religious community at Buckfast Abbey and those engaged in charitable works,” it said. “The trustees work hard to ensure the trust generates a healthy level of income so it can continue to provide this support. As such, the trust makes money in a number of ways.”
As well as selling wine, the abbey offers hotel rooms for visitors who wish to have a taste of the tranquillity that monastic life offers without the obligatory early starts and prayers. A double room in the Northgate House Hotel is advertised at £119 for double occupancy.
The abbey also has a state-of-the-art conference centre where delegates can enjoy a welcome drink of “Buckfast’s Fizz” – tonic wine, fruit, mint, orange juice, soda water and crushed ice.
“Whilst the tonic wine does generate an income, the new hotel-style accommodation at Buckfast Abbey and the recently renovated conference centre have also contributed to the increase in income that the trust received,” the PR statement said.
The abbot, David Charlesworth, would not discuss the problems associated with the drink this week. In a rare BBC interview on the subject in 2013, he said it was unfair to blame the wine, arguing: “We don’t make a product for it to be abused. That’s not the idea. We make a product which is a tonic wine … I’m not producing drugs, which I know are going to be used abusively.”
It was left to Chalk & Ward to come to the drink’s defence this week after the criticism in Dundee from Sheriff Alastair Brown. “We are saddened to hear that, in the sheriff’s opinion, a small number of people in Scotland are not enjoying Buckfast tonic wine in a responsible way,” it said.
“Buckfast Abbey’s charitable trust is a minority shareholder in the company that sells the wine, J Chandler & Co. The trust strives to work with J Chandler & Co to ensure that the tonic wine is marketed and distributed responsibly. The majority of people who drink the tonic wine do so responsibly. We fully support the efforts of charities such as Drinkaware who work to reduce alcohol misuse and harm in the UK.”
Despite the concerns, Buckfast will be part of many festive celebrations. A stall at the Christmas market in Belfast has been selling “Buckie burgers”, while a Glasgow bar is warming customers up with Buckfast mulled wine.
A couple from Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, have been both celebrated and reviled on social media for creating a Christmas tree from 98 empty bottle of Buckfast.
Whether the monks will be cracking open the Buckfast this Christmas remains a mystery. Asked about the monks’ drinking habits, Chalk & Ward made it clear that nobody would be commenting.
It’s often said that fashion is affected by its social and political environment. Same goes for food: the bloated 80s obsession with nouvelle cuisine, the millennial cupcake mania, the current green and right-on passion for foraging. Today’s explosion in niche trends, from comfort food to clean eating, seems to me a reaction to the political shambles we’re in. As the world inches closer to chaos, we focus hard on what we put into our faces. This, at least, is down to us.
Perhaps that’s why dumplings seem to be, er, mushrooming. What could be cosier, more happy-making, safer than little bite-sized bundles of deliciousness? It’s rare for me to meet a dumpling I don’t like, be it Italian ravioli or agnolotti, Turkish manti, Korean mandu, eastern European pelmeni and pierogi, Japanese gyoza, Indian momos and all the many blissful iterations of dim sum: bring ’em on. Even doughy suet numbers, gluey from their stew: yes, yes.
Now, a new breed is emerging: the artisan dumpling, not frozen, not pre-made, but prepared each day by hand. There’s Mama Lan, launched from a cubbyhole in Brixton Market and now with four branches; upcoming Dumpy Lynn from the folk behind the Hoxton Hotel. In New York, people are sucking the broth out of giant xiao long bao (soup dumplings) through straws. The one I’m irresistibly drawn to, though, is My Neighbours The Dumplings – shades of Mizayaki –, with its scuffed but darkly glamorous decor, all lightboxes and lanterns, its youth and enthusiasm, its cool soundtrack and ethically sourced meat and fish. Their hand-crafted dumplings are beautiful enough to frame: classic har gau with a delicate, tensile wrapper, the prawns inside sweetly fresh, almost crunchy. Siu mai wrapped in egg-yolk-yellow skin, elastic and al dente, their pork-and-prawn stuffing distinctly less bouncy than the Chinatown standard and fragrant with ginger, with jewels of keta on top popping with salinity. Potstickers are stuffed with lamb Mongolian-style, or woodsy mushroom and courgette. All are perfectly peachy. There’s also aubergine, baked into sultry smokiness and dressed with sesame paste and seeds – rich and nutty. Pork belly is a masterpiece, pungent with five spice, the meat tender, the fat almost slurpable, the crackling a dangerously good crunch of piggery. Plum sauce on the side. I’m besotted.
MNTD doesn’t pretend to traditionalism, tick-off list notwithstanding. Drinks are mostly sake-based, from small breweries in Japan, and specials could include Thai- and Japanese-style dishes. It’s every bit as cool-kid, communal-tabled as its location suggests: we flee to stools teetering between bar and window. They don’t take bookings (“Sorry, we’re too small”) and there can be queues. Service is charming but a little flaky. So what? The food is worth it all. The couple who own it recently opened a divey sake bar downstairs, named after their own “little dumpling”, baby Matilda. Sweet, like the place itself.
If you think that sounds enragingly h*****r, my second dumpling find of the week will have you bursting out in plooks, as my mamma would say. Dumpling Heart in Shoreditch is the kind of place to give the gibbering vapours to those who get comically irate when a review doesn’t hit their platonic ideal of a restaurant. It’s a long time since I’ve eaten in a back alley with a view of what looks like a fly-tip, complete with abandoned mattress, but here at weekends, improbably shod artist/designer Meihui Liu “curates” (sorry) a small number of handmade Taiwanese-style dumplings from a tiny wooden shack at the Cleve Courtyard market just off Boundary Street (due to reopen in mid-January). We sit outside at oil-clothed tables under bunting, necking vegetarian ones, silky and swollen with glass noodles, sesame oil, kale, spring onions and tofu, and all lacy-bottomed from the frying; and wonderfully juicy pork and cabbage versions, neatly pleated, potsticker-style, and eight to a portion. There might be udon, or pork belly rice, or a heroically gooey fried pancake of spring onion wrapped around kimchi and cucumber with sriracha on the side. It’s all entirely unlikely, but also utterly splendid.
If you’re after tablecloths, padded seating and smarmy operators with giant peppermills, avoid, avoid. If you’re after that insanely satisfying sensation of teeth sinking through just-chewy casings to juicy, scented, satisfying fillings, I’ll probably be teetering on a stool beside you, eating my way to Armageddon.
• My Neighbours The Dumplings 165 Lower Clapton Road, London E5, 020-3327 1556. Open Tues-Sat, 6-11pm; Sun 1-4pm. £20-25 a head, plus drinks and service.
All I remember of the day I was left on a roadside in Pennsylvania, in 1963, was a hand pulling $20 from his pocket, and my small suitcase. I can’t remember who drove me away from the Bruderhof church community I had been shut in since I was a five-year-old girl; now, aged 24, I had been excluded. I was abandoned, but I could breathe again.
My Methodist parents had packed up our Gloucestershire home in 1943 and moved us to a two-room cottage, without hot water or a toilet, in Shropshire. Daddy used to deliver grain from his mill to the Cotswolds Bruderhof – a Christian movement originating in Germany. He was a pacifist and liked this international community of Christians all living together in wartime; eventually he persuaded my mother to join them.
I watched, confused, as two men with beards (“the brothers”) put my mattress on the back of a truck, packed up my beautiful dolls’ house to give away and took us to the closed religious commune. Its men and women, in their matching dress, felt like giants and witches to me. I became extremely insecure.
The church was dogmatic and fanatical. Its members did not use birth control and our family grew from three children to 12. I felt our parents had been brainwashed. They still loved us, but they withdrew; it was as if we children had become the property of the brotherhood.
When I was 14, we were sent to a commune in the jungle in Paraguay, where we lived, alongside other families, in a simple home with a straw roof and clay floor. When I turned 15, I worked all day in the kindergarten and was schooled in the evening. The heat and way of life were oppressive. I suffered panic attacks.
There was one happiness, though: a young man called Jörg who worked as a night watchman. I would wait at my window to see him on horseback. I didn’t know, then, that this was being attracted to someone.
The rules did not allow us to hold hands or kiss, and feelings could be communicated only via a minister. We knew we wanted to marry but when Jörg asked the ministers’ permission, he was refused. They said my spirit was bad. No one ever told me this and I was left to assume he no longer cared for me.
In 1961, I watched my family return to England on the back of a dusty lorry; they would later be moved back and forth between communes in the US and UK, but it had been decided by the brotherhood that, at 22, I was old enough to stay on my own. My heart was in my mouth as I tried to catch Mummy’s attention to wave goodbye. I saw them only a few more times, at the Bruderhof’s behest.
After my family left I was sent to Pennsylvania. I was alone and my spirit was crushed. Two years later, without explanation, I was excluded.
When you experience shock, your mind blanks things out and there are parts of that day I was left on the roadside that I cannot recall. I remember the little house where I rented a room, and the hospital where I asked for a job. And I know that the minute I was left alone, it was as if all my aches and pains left me. I was so relieved to start living. I made friends, but never married.
I heard Jörg’s name again 16 years later, living in London, through a couple who had also been excluded. They said he’d been forced to leave the commune and was living in America. I wrote to him at once.
When his reply arrived, it was as if I had shed a dead skin. I had longed so much for a husband and children, and now, at 40, all my seeking was over. We pieced together how the brotherhood had prevented us from marrying and what had happened to us since. He moved to England and we married six weeks later; soon after, we adopted three children.
I am 78 now and we live four miles from where I was born. I still have private spiritual belief but institutional Christianity isn’t for me.
I always loved my parents, and only when I trained as a counsellor did I feel anger towards them for their complicity in what happened. Part of me is brought to tears when I share my story, but the stronger feeling is one of fulfilment and victory at how life turned out.

It is compulsory for columnists published within 10 days of Christmas to write something on the subject. Only, I can’t face it. As a compromise, I’m going to write about national celebrations and public holidays in general. Not so much a column, then, as a sort of Rotten Tomatoes-style review.
So here is my entirely personal and subjective guide to the top 10 UK festivals, celebrations and public holidays – in reverse order of fun.
10. Lent. The least amusing time of the year. All you get to do is not eat, or give up stuff you enjoy. A religious version of the New Year resolution and tending to be equally unsuccessful. Its main advantage is that no one really takes any notice of it.
9. Shrove Tuesday. An odd one to celebrate because Tuesday isn’t a celebratory kind of day. Furthermore, it’s not a festival in its own right, but merely the day before Lent. Do we celebrate the day before Bonfire night? Or the day before Valentine’s Day? It only has resonance if you are about to fast for 40 days – which you aren’t. To “shrive” means to be absolved of your sins – in this case, by eating a pancake. So it’s like an outsize communion wafer. The only thing keeping Shrove Tuesday out of bottom placing is that pancakes are pretty nice.
8. Summer solstice. Celebrated only marginally. It gets a higher fun rating if you are a druid, new age prophet or wicca priest, in which case you get to sleep over at Stonehenge and play the bongos.
7. Boxing Day. Another inexplicable non-festival day, a bit like Shrove Tuesday, only it’s after the big day itself rather than before, and instead of pancakes you get turkey-stuffing sandwiches.
6. Good Friday. Who celebrates a Jew being nailed to a cross by Italians and tortured and then calls it Good Friday? Not the Neapolitan branch of the Ku Klux Klan, but Christians. Go figure. Even more bizarrely, we get hot cross buns, a bakery depiction of the instrument of torture. An optional extra is to take part in a passion play, but the lead role is only for genuine enthusiasts as it may involve being nailed to a crucifix (or that’s what they do in the Philippines). The opposite of fun. Only gets to hold sixth position because I am unusually fond of buns.
5. Easter Sunday. Makes more sense than Good Friday, because He was raised from the dead. Also you get chocolate. And it marks the start of spring, which is definitely a fun season.
4. Valentine’s Day. Once again associated with food – heart-shaped cakes, heart-shaped pizzas, heart-shaped soup. Often involves the ancient ritual of sitting in an overpriced restaurant with someone you may only marginally like separated by a single, overpriced rose. Above average in terms of enjoyment, but only because it can sometimes get better after dinner if your luck’s in.
3. Halloween. You get to dress up, are given licence to vandalise property, and eat until you are sick. Pretty much the definition of fun at any age.
2. Bonfire night. Although not nearly as good now as when it actually had bonfires, 5 November is still reliably pleasurable. The smell of cordite and spraying sparks, and the screams of scorched children all contribute to the excitement and drama.
1. Christmas Day. The somehow inevitable conclusion of this column. Christmas is and always will be the No 1 Fun Festival. The food is better, there is more booze, the spirit is livelier, it lasts longer and you get to own loads more stuff.
Have a good one – compared with the other nine, it’s relatively easy to get through.
It never quite made it into space, but one of Wigan’s chosen few – a meat and potato pie – has boldly gone where no pastry has gone before.
Tethered to a high-altitude weather balloon, its progress monitored by an onboard camera, the celebrated northern concoction, complete with foil tray, rose to a point 29 miles above the Earth’s crust.
It remained in the air for more than two hours before beginning a graceful descent into a field 38 miles away from its launchpad. First indications were that it did not reheat on entry.
The unmanned flight provided a taster for the World Pie Eating Championships being held in Wigan on Tuesday.
Organisers claim to be optimistic that data collected from the mission will help this year’s contestants down their 12cm competition pies in record time.
Tony Callaghan, who owns Harry’s Bar in the town centre, said: “We are continually questing to go where mankind has never gone before: sub-16 seconds consumption of a regulation pie.
“We are aware that scientists have been experimenting with plants on the international space station, to see if their molecular structure changes, so we are experimenting with pies to see if the structure changes with space travel.”
And the point of that, of course, is to discover whether it “allows the pie to be eaten quicker”.
Callaghan brought in experts from Sheffield-based SentIntoSpace to help with the launch from a pub car park. “Nasa didn’t want to know about this, so we got a couple of lads from Sheffield to sort it instead.”
Bill Kenyon, of Ultimate Purveyors, the St Helens firm commissioned to make the pilot pie, said: “This is the first step to enable mankind to consume pies with more elegance and comfort. Neither the sky, nor the pie, should be the limit.”
Wigan has had a long love affair with the pie, but it was only in 1992 that the world championships were first held in the town.
One of the highlights came in 2005 when Anthony “the Anaconda” Danson - a weight trainer from Lancashire - managed to eat seven pies in three minutes.
Sadly, the 2006 competition was marred by a number of controversies.
First, to the chagrin of local carnivores, organisers had the temerity to introduce a parallel competition for “southern types” who like to put things called vegetables in their pies.
Second, an “impostor”, Matt Dunning, somehow managed to beat off local competition to win the title for Australia.
And third, to meet healthy eating guidelines set by the government, the contest switched from stuffing down as many pies as possible in a given time to the almost genteel pursuit of demolishing a single pie.
But at least national pride was restored the following year, when Adrian Frost, 42, from Wigan no less, polished off his pie in 35.86 seconds.
He was actually quite lucky to find one, it turns out. The night before the big event another competitor’s dog, Charlie, had eaten 20 pies and damaged a further 10.
To say that Wiganers are both proud and fiercely protective of their pies is an understatement.
Bakers have been known to attach notices to their vans, declaring: “No pies are kept in this vehicle overnight.”
And especially not before Tuesday’s contest.
We all have that one friend. The one, just like Leonardo DiCaprio, who likes to educate people about climate change and has gifted their own share of Before The Flood and Inconvenient Truth DVDs. This Christmas, you can show your environmentalist friend that you are listening by making a donation to WildEarth Guardians on their behalf.
WildEarth started in 1989 to fight logging in New Mexico, but it has since expanded its efforts to protect and restore wildlife in the American West. Using your donation, the organization will plant native cottonwoods and willows at one of their river restoration sites. Each Hamilton (a $10 bill) will pay for one new tree. WildEarth will notify your friend about the donation by sending a personalized card.

With nearly 500 endangered groups of animals in the US at the moment, consider donating to the Center for Biological Diversity on behalf of the animal lover in your life.
The center uses science, law and media outreach to fight for “a future for all species, great and small”. It incorporates videos, ads, apps and even endangered species condoms in public awareness campaigns. It creates memorable slogans to accompany the artwork on the condoms: “Before it gets any hotter, think of the sea otter”, “Wrap with care, save the polar bear” and “For the sake of the horned lizard, slow down love wizard”.
A shirt or a fly fishing accessory from Casting for Recovery could be the perfect gift for the sportswoman or sportsman in your life. All proceeds from sales are used to fund fly fishing retreats for women with breast cancer. Since launching in 1998, the nonprofit has organized more than 550 retreats. In 2016 alone, it held 45 retreats in 42 states, serving more than 600 women.
Alternatively, you could just make a donation to Casting for Recovery. A $20 donation buys fishing flies for one retreat, while a $100 donation buys healthy meals for one woman.

Anywhere between 3% to 5% of Americans consider themselves vegetarian. If the vegetarian in your life has a soft spot for farm animals, you should consider sponsoring a farm animal at the Farm Sanctuary. Not only does sponsorship provide food and shelter for a needy farm animal, but the sanctuary, which has several locations throughout the US, also allows sponsors to visit their special farm friend during its visitors season.
Sponsoring a chicken will set you back $120 a year. It would be $180 a year for a duck, goose or turkey and $300 a year for a goat or sheep. While a one-time donation of $20 is not enough to sponsor an animal, it does come with a one-year membership to the sanctuary.

On behalf of a loved one who can always spare change for the homeless, make a contribution to the Empowerment Plan. The organization offers ways to sponsor food, clothing, shelter and transportation for the homeless. A $100 donation, for example, pays for a coat that can turn into a sleeping bag. The Empowerment Plan hires single parents out of shelters to work as seamstresses making the coats. According to its website, it has employed 34 homeless people and handed out more than 15,000 coats since 2012.

This holiday, buy your child a plush animal that can help another tiny human. St Jude Children’s Research Hospital is selling a plush puppy named after a cancer patient, Abigail. Each puppy costs $15 and all proceeds after expenses will be used to further St Jude’s mission of treating childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases free of charge. The hospital also sells other items from its online gift shop: there’s Kiara the tiger cat, a selection of clothes and sketch pads.
Alternatively, why not give the little man or woman in your life a gift made from recycled materials? Vawn and Mike Gray make recycled glass nightlights with endearing details in their Cape Coral, Florida studio. They use recycled glass and an energy-efficient kiln to create fun, colorful pieces for children.
Independent, local journalism is critical for keeping elected officials accountable and connecting people within a community. Consider a local newspaper subscription for your news junkie friend. (Or, ahem, the Guardian.) If you aren’t sure about the subscription options, enter your friend’s zipcode here to find out if they are eligible. (It is best to subscribe to newspapers straight from their websites, however.) A good alternative to a local newspaper is a subscription to a regional magazine such as Boston Magazine, Texas Monthly, Texas Tribune, Chicago Magazine or Our State, a North Carolina magazine.
Throw in a few good DVDs about journalism, too. Spotlight, on the Boston Globe’s investigation of a sexual abuse coverup within the Catholic church, is a good one. So is Network, an oldie from 1976 about a fictional TV news program that uses entertainment to drive ratings.

Holding a civil debate with conservative relatives can be so challenging during the holidays. Let counter-programming do the work instead. Sign them up for a subscription to their local NPR station and ask them to give its content a chance.
Want to avoid politics? You can sign them up for nonpartisan collections of stories on NPR, such as the dog tales or cat tales. After all, who doesn’t love a good animal story?
Delight your book lover friends by introducing them to tomes from a small publishing house. Almost 40% of books are published by five major publishing houses. Small, independent presses are an important source for a greater variety of voices and perspectives. Here are a few great small publishers who have fabulous books in fiction, nonfiction and poetry: Graywolf Press, Red Hen Press, Inkshares, and Melville House.
Books from small, independent co-op bookstores are also a great gift idea. Try Antigone Books in Tucson, Arizona, which also has the benefit of being 100% solar-powered; Powell’s in Portland, Oregon; and the famous City Lights in San Francisco, California.

There has been a fair bit of seismic change to take in this year, one way or another, so you’d be forgiven for having missed one important shift: at some point in 2016, we passed peak jumpsuit. For the first half of this decade, the all-in-one was a visual shorthand for the busy modern woman who engages with fashion to look up-to-date as much as pretty. From the Chiltern Firehouse waiting staff in their sleekly tailored jumpsuits to the dungarees and Stan Smiths accessorised with a Bugaboo, the all-in-one has been everywhere.
And for several Decembers on the trot, the jumpsuit came into its own. In the season of office parties and friends’ nights out, a jumpsuit is in many ways the perfect look: upbeat without being gaudy, practical without being killjoy. At this time of year, you want to tread a line somewhere between Scrooge and the person wearing the novelty Santa hat; that is, to exude festive spirit in an infectious way, rather than being the Compulsory Fun Police blasting Mariah Carey on repeat.
If the jumpsuit you already have remains your go-to, then you are all set. One of the happy side-effects of the slow death of fashion’s strict trend cycle has been that when a look works, it sticks around for a while. But if you are in the market for a new party look, the jumpsuit is no longer the freshest item on the shelf.
This season’s update is the cold-shoulder party dress. The shoulder has been fashion’s erogenous zone of 2016 but, more importantly, previews of next year’s collections make it clear that it will rule 2017 as well. The joy of a cold-shoulder dress is that it works well as over-the-table dressing if you are out for dinner in a setting where, say, a feathered skirt would be pointless. Also, it looks more daring than it feels: shoulders don’t jiggle, so the focus remains on your face rather than your body. And if you have been used to wearing a jumpsuit, it feels like a dramatic change. What could be more 2016 than that?
My overwhelming memory of my childhood is the constant busyness in the house. I am seventh out of eight kids – five boys and three girls – plus my mom, Ruth. Getting ready for school in the morning was a major production with queues for the bathroom, bickering and people forgetting stuff.
Mom did a great job of taking care of us all, single-handedly. We were a very tight-knit family, but we all had to pull our weight. My sisters started to cook at nine and, being one of the youngest, I wanted in on it, too, so I began at six on potato-peeling duty as french fries were my thing.
Dad was largely absent. I only saw him a few days in my life. He didn’t seem interested in us at all.
I was quite shy as a child. My sisters were the gang leaders, my brothers were the enforcers and I was a tag-a-long. I liked staying safe, so I was always trying to keep my older brother Lloyd out of trouble, telling him off for being too risky and adventurous.
The underlying value Mom taught us was respect, everyone from winos on the street to our elders. Being from such a large family, she wanted to drill these basic values of compassion, empathy and mutual respect into us from a young age so she didn’t have to micromanage us. It is an easy, simple message, but often difficult to achieve.
We tried not to fight, or at least get caught fighting, because Mom would make us go through an embarrassing ritual where she would get us to hug and then kiss each other. By the end, everybody would be laughing because we would be hamming it up.
It was always quite a squeeze wherever we lived. At one place, the laundry room was converted into a bedroom for us boys, but the hardest was when all eight of us and Mom were in a one-bed apartment in Los Angeles. One of us got chickenpox and then we all did. Family mealtimes were always very sociable with us sitting as a group on the floor.
Mom had an incredible work ethic. She held down three jobs for much of her life to help support us, as overnight nurse, a realtor [estate agent] and a pastor. She never complained, she just got on with it. Oddly, I never remember her gone – she was always there when we needed her. I never felt neglected. I don’t know how she managed it all with eight kids. Our washing machine was always breaking down. Even being on the road 300 days a year, doing 250 shows, I don’t think I’m working anywhere near as hard as my mother.
We moved to an all-white neighbourhood when I was seven, in Bakersfield, California. It was the first time I encountered racism first-hand, from ugly name-calling to burning crosses in our yard, my brother Brian being shot [he survived] and the house being pelted with faeces and garbage. My mother handled it with stoicism and dignity, reinforcing that we kids should rise above it and treat those around us with respect. The night my brother was shot, us kids cleaned his room spotless for him for when he came home and shared happy memories of him.
My mother gave me the courage to pursue music as a career on her deathbed. She became very ill when I was 21. I didn’t want her to worry about my future. I wanted her to know I’d finish my degree. But she pushed me to follow my dream, even if it wasn’t the safe option.
I’m now a dad myself (to three-year-old Demyan with my wife, Victoria) and I want to be the opposite of my dad. I love being involved with him and letting him know I’m rooting for him and will support him in whatever he does. Shouldn’t every parent?

The TV chef Michel Roux Jr has said he will scrap the the service charge on all diners’ bills from the end of January after admitting his Michelin-starred Le Gavroche used the 13% additional fee as revenue rather than sharing it among staff.
The former Masterchef judge apologised earlier this week for paying chefs less than the legal minimum wage, as revealed in a Guardian investigation, and announced on Friday that Le Gavroche would mark on bills and menus that no further payment was needed, although customers could still leave a tip if they wished.
In an interview with the Caterer, Roux said he considered tipping and voluntary service charges to be different things, but confirmed he was scrapping the latter because he was “fed up with this ambiguity”. Instead he would raise the price of dishes – a fixed-price menu with wine currently costs £212 a person – by 13%.
“For me, tipping and service charge are two different things but by removing the service charge and incorporating it into the cost of the menu then it is clear, clean and unambiguous,” he said. “And then if diners wish to leave a tip on top of that it is up to them.
“I think this is something we should do in the restaurant industry. It is not clear for the customer whether or not they should leave extra on the table or whether or not it is going to all the staff or how it is being distributed. I daresay some restaurateurs have been abusing that,” Roux said.
Earlier this week, the chef said he was “embarrassed and sorry” after the Guardian revealed he was paying chefs as little as £5.50 an hour when they were working 68 hours a week.
Chefs angered at being paid below the legal minimum wage in his Mayfair restaurant said the situation was exacerbated by its decision not to share the service charge that many diners assume supplements staff wages.
At the time, a spokeswoman for the restaurant said: “All Le Gavroche staff, front of house and kitchen, share in the 13% discretionary service charge.”
But after further questioning, the restaurant made clear that no member of staff received any of the service charge over and above their basic wages. “Wages are not dependent on fluctuating levels of discretionary service charges or cash tips,” a spokeswoman said. “Gratuities form just one part of the payroll each month. Service charge is treated as revenue, and the restaurant pays all taxes accordingly.”
She said the original statement was trying to make clear that the waiters and chefs were treated equally in the matter of service charge, not that they received any of it in addition to their wages.
One chef who spoke to the Guardian about the issue said: “Roux was fully aware that to share the service charge is what the public expects. He was purporting to share the service charge, but he wasn’t. We don’t do this job for the money, but he makes out that he shares this money and he doesn’t.”
The government said earlier this year that it believed all discretionary payments for service, after tax where applicable, should be given to the worker. A government consultation on service charges and tipping, led by the former business secretary Sajid Javid, called for service charges on customers’ bills to be clear and voluntary and said it was considering prohibiting employers from taking any cut, to provide greater protection for workers. The consultation found 61% of diners believed staff should keep 100% of service charges.
It came after some of the country’s best-known restaurant chains, including Giraffe, Zizzi, Pizza Express, Strada and Ask Italian, were accused of keeping all or part of the service charges automatically added to bills, rather than passing them on to staff.
The British Hospitality Association, of which Le Gavroche is a member, has said restaurants should be legally required to tell customers how service charges and tips are distributed among staff.
Roux said he hoped other restaurants would follow Le Gavroche and incorporate the service charge into menu prices.
“Hopefully others will join me in making it clearer for the public to understand what they are paying for, and this move will also ensure there is complete transparency for our front of house and kitchen teams,” he said.

“At Christmas time, the kitchen rejoices with reassuring smells. While a festive cotechino cooks quietly in the oven, I sometimes take a break from the boiling and chopping to sit down by the fire and peel some wrinkly, often gigantic, oranges.
As I throw the peel on to the fire, the scent of orange oil brings back memories of the cakes I made as a child. Many Italian cakes celebrate citrus, but the most splendidly citrussy of them all is pastiera, a glorious pastry pie stuffed with a symphony of soft ricotta, cooked wheat, eggs, orange-blossom water, spices and candied fruits. It’s actually an Easter recipe traditionally, but its ingredients sing of Christmas, and you can find it on Italian tables all year round.
I spent my childhood in a convent school. I was an unruly kid and was often put in the corner to “reflect”, so to speak. On a good day, my favourite nun, Suor Fortunata, would take me to the kitchen to help her cook. She was not only a teacher but took charge of the school refectory, overseeing what was served to the pupils. On Thursdays, the day before the traditional magro – a day of abstinence from all animal products and sweet indulgences – we would regularly be served pastiera. We were a rowdy lot, but just the sight of the pastiera had us goggle-eyed and orderly with anticipation.
Oranges are the essence of this cake. When eating it, I can’t help but be taken back to those childhood days when their bittersweet fragrance wafted through the air. The smell, the taste and the ritual of making pastiera makes me feel at home.
Makes 1 x 23cm cake
20g unsalted butter, plus extra to grease
30g raisins
50ml milk
200g canned cooked wheat (available in good Italian delicatessens or online)
Rind of 1 lemon, cut into chunks
350g ricotta cheese
300g caster sugar
3 eggs, separated
2 tbsp orange blossom water
1 tsp cinnamon powder
50g candied orange peel, chopped
50g walnuts, chopped
For the pastry
1 egg
250g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting
100g caster sugar
1 tsp baking powder
80g unsalted butter
30ml limoncello liqueur
Zest of 1 lemon
2 Put the raisins in water and soak for 30 minutes. Drain and squeeze dry.
3 Meanwhile, make the pastry. Put the egg, flour, sugar, baking powder, butter, liqueur and lemon zest into a food processor and mix together to form a dough. Roll into a ball, wrap in clingfilm and leave to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
4 Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Melt the butter in a saucepan. Add the milk, wheat and lemon rind. Simmer over a low heat for 10 minutes.
5 Beat the ricotta with half the sugar in a bowl. In a second bowl, whisk the yolks with the remaining sugar until fluffy.
6 In a third bowl, beat the egg whites together with the orange blossom water and cinnamon until stiff.
7 Using a wooden spoon, gently mix together the ingredients from all three bowls. Add the wheat mixture and fold in the orange peel, raisins and walnuts.
8 Unwrap the pastry and cut off two thirds. Sandwich the larger piece between two sheets of baking paper and roll it out into a 29cm disc. Place in the base of the cake tin, carefully pushing the pastry 3cm up the sides of the tin. Chill for 10 minutes.
9 Roll out the remaining pastry third between sheets of baking paper as before and cut into 10 strips measuring 23cm x 2cm. Arrange the strips on a sheet of lightly floured greaseproof paper and chill for 5 minutes.
10 Remove the base from the fridge and pour over the wheat cream. Gently place the strips on top in a lattice pattern and bake for 1 hour, until slightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Leave to cool for at least 30 minutes to allow the filling to become firm before serving.
There are some words that, when I see them in recipes, make me feel immediately suspicious and/or nervous, and “luxury” is one. For me, “luxury” food is (a) something that someone else brings to me, (b) is cooked by someone else, or (c) makes me wince when I see the bill. Nothing I make in my kitchen is “luxury” as far as I’m concerned, and that the next three words in Delia’s recipe are “smoked fish pie” only added to my unease.
Don’t get me wrong: I love fish pie. But making it for other people is one of the most stressful experiences out there. In my last year of university, I lived alone but entertained large groups regularly, partly as an elaborate con to get them to top up my flat’s supplies of alcohol. I quickly learned there were some meals that weren’t worth making, as you’d soon be inundated with requests, all of which had the same basic shape: can you make it like my mum does it? The simpler the meal – and let’s face it, fish pie is fairly simple – the greater the number of quirks that each household can add, and the more my fish pie will leave you yearning for your mum’s.
In our household, fish pie tensions revolve around the use of cheese. I dislike the stuff, while my partner loves it. The fact that I rarely cook with it has taken a heavy toll on her (something I only really appreciated a few weeks ago, when a waiter at a favourite restaurant asked me how “the cheeseboard lady” was doing). In fish pie, I prefer using anchovies in lieu of cheese – a trick I learned from Felicity Cloake. My partner tells me this is almost as good as using cheese, though whether she says that out of politeness or genuine belief is unclear.
Delia’s luxury smoked fish pie recipe is a good reintroduction even if you think you know fish pie. The run-through is very clear, and I avoided the usual moments of panic, when either none of the component parts are quite ready or they all are. It’s also a good grounding in the “theory” of a fish pie – you can change the components at will, while retaining the essential hallmarks: a white fish such as haddock for the base, an oilier fish such as salmon, plus another flavour such as kippers, depending on your mood.
My one addendum: Delia recommends putting the haddock into bake for 10 minutes while skinning and boning the rest of the fish. Although this is a tight turnaround, you will want to let the haddock cool until it is “cool enough to handle”, giving you more time than you think to get the rest of the fish done.
Delia describes her recipe as more of a party dish. You could, just about, make this on a working day, but I like it best as a weekend meal, particularly as the leftovers mature very well and make for a good packed lunch.
What about the cheese? I had planned to make this recipe without cheese and simply lie about it – but then my partner threatened to report me to the press regulator, so I thought better of it. (Now that I think about it, she was simply being polite about the anchovy, wasn’t she?)
But, as it turns out, Delia’s recipe calls on you to put the cheese on top, right at the end – an excellent compromise that allows me to make a his-and-hers fish pie that pleases everybody, and tastes delicious. Peace in our time: a fish pie to settle all arguments. If only Delia were running the world and not my kitchen.
The big smiler revisits the classics for a markedly trad family feast: a succulent bird, a tasty gravy, an exceptional spud. He’s got sprouts and carrots on the side, gravadlax for starters and chocolate puds to finish. Anyone who’s loved him since 1999 will know the value in his plain-spoken enthusiasm: he doesn’t just make things look easy, he actually does take the headache out of cooking. Even the multi-headache-inducing, multi-dish Christmas Day spectacular.
Drink: Jamie’s own “incredible mulled cider” (with pomegranate, clementine and orange).
Popcorn: topped with salt and vinegar.
Matt Tebbut does a full Felicity Cloake and trials three methods for cooking the perfect turkey (stuffing the skin, turning the bird upside-down and strapping ice-packs to the breast). In France, Kate Quilton quaffs pink champagne in Reims and Jimmy Doherty wrangles exploding chestnuts in the Ardèche. This foodie explorathon also takes in the North American lobster that’s giving our more costly crustaceans a run for their money, and a 380m2 Norwegian gingerbread city.
Drink: a classic champagne cocktail (angostura bitters, cognac, sugar, sparkling wine).
Popcorn: gingerbread popcorn (coated in treacle, ginger, cinnamon and lots of butter).
If you were one of the record 14 million who watched this year’s GBBO finale and mourned the passing of an unlikely hero of a BBC show, don’t miss its last hurrah. Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood will be joined by bakers from previous years for a yuletide two-dayer. They’ll don the requisite festive aprons and gaudy jumpers and, at Mel and Sue’s dulcet “On your marks, get set, bake!”, tackle three challenges. Baking under duress in a wedding tent has never been so watchable.
Drink: as much tea as you can muster.
Popcorn: cake batter popcorn (coated in melted white chocolate, cake mix from a box and sprinkles).
“Oh my … WHAT is that?” is how Christmas starts on Victorian Bakers. Our four ye olde bakers – all lamplit tweed and bustle – are tasked with making actual mince pies – from, you know, tongue and calves’ feet and tripe and roast beef. To get the job done, they have only their knives, a stack of dusty cookbooks and their wits. “So do you think this is going to taste better?” asks one baker to another, as real suet and tripe are finely chopped. “Personally, I think this might not … but hey. I’m open-minded.”
Drink: a Dickensian sherry flip (eggs, sugar, nutmeg, oloroso or cream sherry).
Popcorn: mincemeat popcorn (mix half a jar of mincemeat into a bowl of popped corn, spread out on a tray and bake until dry – about 10 minutes at 180C/350F/gas mark 4).
Warming tones of copper and brown were a big catwalk trend for AW16. Mix with off-white to keep the look fresh
 The cardigan is a piece of statement clothing. And the statement it used to make was, ‘My mother, with whom I still live, knitted this for me.’ It was Smiths-era Morrissey, pictured, who liberated it from this Norman Bates situation, giving it some intellectual and romantic heft. In this season’s iteration, the cardie has a shawl neck and an emphasised shoulder. It is now alpha, and only goes back to mother’s house for the occasional home-cooked meal.
For those social workers lucky enough to have their own desk, any type of storage or organiser would not go amiss this Christmas. Shops like Ikea and John Lewis have a range of basic desk tidies, but more creative options can be found on sites such as Etsy, like these wooden blocks or 3D-printed hexagonal pots. For those with a more generous budget, this wall-mounted organiser will get a desk sorted in no time.
Treat the social worker in your life to a more glamorous notebook for all their appointments, reminders and thoughts in 2017. There are thousands to choose from, but if you head over to sites such as Papier, Ohhdeer or Chroma you’ll find a range of beautiful, ornate stationery, some of which can be personalised.
And to help your special social worker organise their time – as well as their desk – next year, how about this Clare in the Community calendar? Cartoonist Harry Venning, whose weekly cartoon is a SocietyGuardian staple, has put together 12 humorous illustrations that will hopefully cheer up anyone on the more trying days.
We’ve recommended this before, but it’s still true that social workers love a good cuppa. This year, how about going gourmet with the tea selection? Sign up your special social worker to a tea subscription, such as Bruu tea, Blue Bird Tea Co. and Eteaket, that can be delivered to their desk (or the one they use the most) on a monthly basis.
Don’t forget to give them something to drink all that tea from. There are so many social worker-themed mugs out there, but this one – I’m a social worker, what’s your superpower? – is a particular favourite. We also love these colourful loose-leaf teapots, perfect for all the fancy tea you’ll be drinking.
And for something to munch on while you’re at it, it has to be cake. Why not buy a baking cookbook or two, or sign up for a day of baking classes? If you’re in London, Bread Ahead or Konditor & Cook are highly-rated, but there are schools dotted all around the country.
In fact, why not combine the two and book an upmarket afternoon tea for your beloved social worker? For all the posh cake and tea he or she could ever want, Bettys is an absolute classic.
We love the idea of administering “chill pills” in times of great stress. Sadly, this jar does not actually come with any sweets, but it does give some inspiration for a lovely homemade gift; save a leftover jam jar, sneak a sticker from the stationery cupboard and fill with their favourite pick ’n’ mix.
For those on a budget (especially after any Christmas extravagances), taking in your own lunch is a surefire way to save money. But leave the grimy Tupperware at home and take in your sandwiches and fruit in any one of these colourful lunch bags or boxes.
How about some long books to while away all the hours spent in transit? If they’ve already read War and Peace, Infinite Jest and Don Quixote, you could always turn to the appropriately-titled In Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust – at 4,215 pages it’s sure to get your social care worker through a number of tortuous journeys. All these big books might get a bit heavy though, so a Kindle or other e-reader might be in order, or an audiobook subscription (browse the year’s best buys).
All social workers could do without the onset of panic when their phone starts to run out of battery in the middle of a day full of meetings and appointments. Beat any low-battery anxiety with a power bank. The Zendure A2 is the best rated by PC Advisor and will charge iPhones and Androids.
We’re sure not many social workers will want a constant reminder of their work at home, but some cheery and motivational artwork would be welcomed in any drab council building. We like this print. A magnetic lightbox would also serve well to spread cheery and motivational messages around the office.
We know that social workers can’t be everywhere all the time, so why not make a donation in their name to a charity – such as Mind or the Samaritans – that will support vulnerable people when they can’t.

A film with myriad problems – not least its glaringly anachronistic monoracial version of London – but most were all too apparent evenwhen it came out in Christmas 2003, when Tony Blair wasn’t a political pariah and Donald Trump was just an attention-seeking casino magnate. What really stands out – especially in this year of Brexit and president-elect Trump – is that Love Actually is not horribly sexist as some claim, it’s a powerful excoriation of white, male hegemony and the terrible things men do as a result, actually.
There’s Andrew Lincoln’s creepy portrayal of a man who just can’t help but confess his love to his best friend’s new wife, played by Keira Knightley, looking younger than Lincoln by every one of the 12 years that separate their ages; Hugh Grant’s pervy prime minister seducing the No 10 household staff (Martine McCutcheon, mystifyingly referred to as fat at every opportunity); the cleaner for Colin Firth’s character falling head over heels in love with a much older man despite the fact they can’t speak the same language. Talk about a mid-life fantasy.
The film really shows its hand in the only truly moving story, told predominantly from a woman’s point of view, with Alan Rickman’s superb portrayal of a philandering husband. I ask you, is there any greater display of white male idiocy than deciding to cheat on Emma Thompson? Perhaps we should refer that question to Kenneth Branagh … If you really needed it confirming in 2016, stick this on the TV. White men suck, actually. 
John McClane flies to Los Angeles for Christmas to be with his estranged wife, only for her incredible 1980s office block to be invaded by gunmen. Unfortunately for them McClane is a cop – yippie ki yay etc. But oh, how quaint Alan Rickman’s German terrorist Hans Gruber seems now to modern audiences so used to a constant stream of “evil Muslims” from Hollywood blockbusters. Of course, it is eventually revealed that Rickman (whose death this year is just another tragedy in the long litany of awfulness served up by 2016) is using political rhetoric to disguise more selfish, financial motives. Sound familiar? Die Hard was well ahead of its time in exposing the fact that what might appear to be someone taking a principled stand to protect those in need is actually about the rich getting richer, and while they’re at it shafting the poor, represented here by Bruce Willis’s working class copper. 
The McCallister family go on holiday to Paris, but leave little Kevin behind with a house full of junk food and at the mercy of burglars. The casual disregard for child safety is shocking. To do it once is bad enough, but to follow up by leaving him in New York just a couple of years later (at the mercy of a cameoing Donald Trump no less) in Home Alone 2 should surely have been enough for the McCallister children to be taken into care. But, then again, if David Cameron can leave his kid at a pub without people batting an eyelid maybe times haven’t changed all that much.
It’s the character of Old Man Marley who rings most alarm bells in 2016. The creepy old neighbour, who the local kids think murdered his family, is eventually revealed to have a softer side when he confides in Macaulay Culkin in a church. But is he a bit too friendly with our eight-year-old protagonist? The revelation that he watches his granddaughter sing in the choir every year, but isn’t allowed to speak to her due to a mysterious argument with his own son, rings alarm bells that mean when he comes to the rescue at the end, and is rewarded with a cathartic reunion with his own family, a modern audience is left to wonder if Marley might have more malign intent than the “wet bandits” he has foiled. Cynical, perhaps. But it’s hard not to be these days.
A guardian angel comes to George Bailey, who is on the verge of being declared bankrupt and is pondering killing himself, to show him how awful the world would be without him. But while you’re weeping into your mince pies it can be easy to miss the key message of this festive staple. Bring back building societies. The mortgage crisis that caused the 2008 crash could have been avoided if we’d focused more on safe, localised lending – of the sort that rescues Bailey at the film’s denouement.
A community’s savings stored in each other’s homes instead of mortgage-backed securities and collateralised debt obligations: the message isn’t subtle – but it’s more relevant today than ever, and few have put it more succinctly than James Stewart in his speech to the loan board: “What’d you say a minute ago? They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait? Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they’re so old and broken down that they … Do you know how long it takes a working man to save $5,000? Just remember this, Mr Potter, that this rabble you’re talking about, they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath?”
What might appear to be a sweet retelling of the pinnacle of Christmas fables – as a grouchy Michael Caine is imbued with the festive spirit by the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future – is now revealed as a malevolent paean to the neoliberal economic consensus. The familiar narrative of Scrooge having his heart melted by the plight of Tiny Tim (surely Robin the Frog’s finest performance) seems to appeal to all our better instincts about what Christmas should represent. But in an age of swingeing cuts to welfare budgets, all this story really does is bolster the arguments in favour of capitalist free markets and small-state conservatism.
The Cratchit family don’t need a safety net provided by a welfare state, the film says, everything will be fine as long as the deserving rich do their philanthropic duty. It’s this kind of pervasive, paternalistic thinking from the right, which ignores the massive structural inequalities in society, that allows massive corporations to avoid paying their fair share. Why pay tax when you can hand out a few crumbs to needy causes? Et tu, Kermit? 
Joe Dante’s comedy-horror about a suburban family taking in an exotic, seemingly cuddly animal, leading to an outbreak of the eponymous, bloodthirsty critters, leans hard on postwar fears of foreigners, vocalised through Dick Miller’s Murray Futterman. But what at the time of release appeared to be a mockery of the last gasp of a xenophobic generation is now revealed to be a prescient metaphor for the dangers of cultural appropriation. Lionel Shriver might not worry about this, but in Gremlins it becomes all too apparent what damage this can do.
Mr Wing (a racist stereotype even then) refuses to sell the innocent-looking mogwai, knowing all too well this cookie-cutter American family will not be able to obey the rules, and so it proves with disastrous consequences. Even though they try to respect the ancient customs that surround this mystical creature, they can’t help but blunder, getting them wet, feeding them after midnight, and thus letting loose havoc. As the old Chinese wise man says at the end: “You do with mogwai what your society has done with all of nature’s gifts. You do not understand.” And a special shout out to Gremlins 2, a sub-par film in many ways, but ahead of its time with its critique of urban gentrification.
A second spin on the Dickens classic, this time a satire on the excesses of 1980s television that now seems almost restrained in comparison with modern reality. The thread that most resonates this year, though, is the fate of a friendly homeless man, Herman, destined to freeze to death in the cold whatever path Bill Murray’s Frank takes after his encounter with the ghosts. The number of rough sleepers in Britain is estimated to have doubled since 2010. After years of concerted effort by the Labour government, progress has been drastically reversed since the austerity programme began. Scrooged came out in 1988, but people are still dying on our streets while we tuck in to our turkey dinners. That’s a political choice, not an economic necessity. We should all hang our heads in shame. 
The Duke brothers place a bet on whether a random person off the street, Eddie Murphy, can replace their high-born protege, Dan Akyroyd, without affecting their stock-trading business. It’s a story that reveals the great emperors of capitalism really are wearing no clothes, and is as relevant now as it was in 1983. Success is still largely determined by the level of privilege people are born into. Racism is still rife. And bankers are still chancers, gambling with all our futures. Merry Christmas!
Selective mutism wasn’t a diagnosis in common usage among teachers back in the 1980s when I started school; at least, no one ever used the phrase around me. I didn’t hear it until I was an adult, when suddenly it gave a name to “the thing that stopped me speaking for around 25 years of my life”.
It certainly doesn’t feel selective if you’re stuck in it. As described on the website ispeak, selective mutism (SM) is “a severe situational anxiety disorder … [which] generally starts in early childhood but can, if not treated early enough, continue into adulthood. Children and adults with SM are often fully capable of speaking … but cannot speak in certain situations because they are phobic of initiating speech.”
I was just a quiet kid at first – very shy, very jumpy – and I can’t remember exactly why that turned into just not talking any more. There often isn’t a specific reason SM children stop talking; it just happens. I stopped on one of my first days at school, when I mimed colouring a finished picture with a crayon for about an hour, because I couldn’t make myself speak to the teacher. The pretense continued until she realised that no child takes that long to perfect a daffodil.
Physically, I was able to talk. I was fine speaking to my family at home, as soon as the front door closed, but life away from those safe spaces became almost silent, and silent kids who stare wide-eyed at the floor just creep people out after a while. Especially teachers. “She’s very shy” turned into “She won’t answer me”. “She’ll certainly never go to university” in year 2 became “She frequently has a pained expression and does not communicate” in year 5.
The problem was, as one of those kids that cared deeply about what adults thought of them, and genuinely valued good behaviour, not speaking was an Ironman challenge of self-destruction. Whenever a new adult with a wavering smile waited expectantly for me to answer them, I’d be torturing myself: “I need to answer her now – I have to, because she’s so uncomfortable, she’s worried. Stay still and she’ll leave.”
It’s difficult to explain the feeling of selective mutism to someone who’s never been trapped in it. It’s a lot like being frightened all the time and waiting for the next bad thing to happen that you won’t be able to stop. It’s not being able to force a decent voice out, even when you desperately try – a tiny whisper will emerge instead, and it hurts. For the kids at school it meant they could press their forearm against my throat in a hallway between classes if they were having a bad day, and it would be OK; they knew I’d just freeze and wait it out. Yelling, punching, stealing, touching – I’d hear my name being whispered as I went to classes, contorting me into a seven-hour school day cringe, adrenaline always raging.
Teacher after teacher would take me aside to gently ask if there were problems at home, did I get on with my parents, had anything changed recently? I’d fume, inside: “You just watched the class dipshit bounce my head off a wall because he doesn’t understand what you’re teaching him, and you’re asking me if the problem is at home?” What would struggle out was a hoarse “No” and I’d mentally file the teacher away as an idiot. Every year, every subject: “Phoebe works hard but never asks for help”, “Must try to discuss ideas more freely”, “If she were not so shy … ”
On a year 10 parent night schedule, I angrily scrawled this note for my mum: “I hate oral work, tell him to be more gentle on me when we do it! Tell him what we did with The Merchant of Venice was stupid and pointless! I get really upset and worried about performing in front of the class! Please tell him!” But teachers are there to prepare you for the world, not protect you by letting you skip reciting Shylock when it’s your turn. The message they’d instilled in me about what would happen outside, after school, had sunk in deep: I was not OK. Until I received a different message, at 17, from my English literature teacher, Mr Pearman.
He had a blank face that showed no concern about whether his classes were taking in the lesson or not. He’d calmly insult kids he didn’t like with words he knew they wouldn’t understand, and enjoy the confused look he’d get back. He told us, while turning on the overhead projector and leaving it empty, about a fun game he liked to play of turning the projector on with nothing on it to see how long the class would stare stupidly at the wall.
“I hear your other teachers saying you don’t talk,” he told me one day, after I’d been in his class a few weeks. “It’s not a problem. I’ve read your work – it’s good. So, it doesn’t matter to me what you say or don’t. You don’t worry me.” He shrugged, and calmly gazed at me; quiet.
Thank you. “Thank you, thank you,” I whispered quickly, mind whirring: “How can I sum everything up to him – he knows already though, doesn’t he? But I want to tell him. I can’t, but I want to do that for him.”
I couldn’t yet. But that was the start.
Period poverty campaigners have welcomed the news that Boots is to support the drive to help women and girls struggling to pay for basic sanitary products.
Britain’s biggest pharmacy chain will trial an in-store donation point to allow customers to gift desperately needed sanitary products for distribution to a local food bank, as well as contributing as a company. If it proves successful, Boots will consider rolling out the scheme across the country.
Boots made the announcement following a meeting with the shadow minister for women and equalities, Paula Sherriff, on Wednesday and will pilot the scheme in her Dewsbury constituency.
Una Kent, director of communications and CSR for Boots UK, told the Guardian: “Boots UK has always understood that access to basic hygiene items is hugely important for personal health and wellbeing, indeed the first non-pharmacy product we sold over a hundred years ago was a soap and sponge. Supporting the essential hygiene needs of people is as vital today as it was then and it’s these items that are often most needed by food banks.”
Sherriff is one of a cross-party group of MPs that has been raising the issue of period poverty - when women and girls struggle to pay for basic sanitary products on a monthly basis, with significant impact on their hygiene, health and wellbeing - which was highlighted by the Guardian on Monday.
Lobbying in the Commons has been led by the tampon tax champion Laura Coryton, who successfully persuaded the government to scrap VAT on sanitary products in 2015, to highlight the Homeless Period project, which aims to increase the donation of sanitary products to homeless shelters. It follows a similar campaign in the Scottish parliament lead by Scottish Labour’s inequalities spokesperson, Monica Lennon.
Following Monday’s article, Proctor and Gamble - one of the companies specifically targeted by the Homeless Period - contacted Coryton to put her in touch with In Kind Direct, an organisation which redistributes product donations to charities and gave away around 10,000 packs of sanitary products from P&G last year. Coryton now hopes to work alongside P&G to encourage similar companies to do the same.
While the demand for women’s sanitary products has been evident to food banks and homeless shelters for some time, the recent focus on the humiliating consequences of period poverty in the Ken Loach film I, Daniel Blake brought menstrual inequality into the mainstream for the first time.
Sherriff told the Guardian that she hoped the move by Boots, whose market is predominantly women of menstruating age, would encourage other companies to take corporate social responsibility seriously. But she said there was a wider need to consider whether women should be paying for sanitary products at all when items like condoms and prescriptions are free to those on lower incomes.
The Dewsbury MP added that there was also a need to look particularly at the female experience of poverty. “We often talk about people in poverty, but the latest research from the House of Commons library shows that women are disproportionately affected by the government’s tax and benefit changes by 86%.”
Supporting the Homeless Period campaign in the Commons chamber on Tuesday, Sherriff highlighted the fact that public attitudes towards menstruation continued to hinder attempts to raise awareness: “When I started campaigning in this House on the tampon tax, some honerable members recoiled, while others did not even want to talk about periods or tampons, as if the words themselves were obscene. I do not regret providing such a culture shock to this place – quite the opposite – but that reaction exemplifies why the issue of homeless women’s access to sanitary care is so widespread and terribly underestimated.”
 Its decline began before the last owner moved out in 1988 and all its period treasures have vanished inside. This could be good news for an energetic buyer because the council conservationists are happy to allow a contemporary refit provided the facade is restored. Permission has been granted for a two-bedroom eco-friendly design with an open-plan living area flowing round a circular enclosed dining room and circular bathroom upstairs. You are allowed to erect a glass-fronted, zinc-clad guest lodge with a decked terrace above the river, and landscape the steep garden into a series of terraces.
 ‘Companies spend millions of dollars developing breakthrough technology, and we were reporting on the latest “mascara war” between two of the giants,’ Posnick recalls. ‘The model’s eyes were closed for two hours while Penn photographed every possible variation... He had a picture that wasn’t especially exciting or memorable, but there was nothing that he hadn’t already tried... Our model opened her eyes, and I saw that they were completely bloodshot. Penn said, “Don’t move.” He did just two or three more exposures. Here was the shock that was missing’
Increasing interest in animal welfare means there are a range of options for where your ham comes from this Christmas. What should you look for if you want to tuck into a ham from an ethically raised pig?
You’ll find hams from four main production systems on supermarket shelves this year: conventional, sow stall-free, free range and “outdoor bred, raised indoor on straw”. But what do these labels mean?
Conventional hams come from pigs farmed in intensive systems, where sows (mother pigs) and piglets (the pigs that your Christmas ham comes from) are housed indoors.
Piglets are weaned when they are about three or four weeks old. They are then housed in group pens on slatted or concrete floors (sometimes with straw or litter) until they are turned into ham and other pork products at about four months.
Some of the main animal welfare issues in intensive pig farming relate to the confinement of mother pigs. During their pregnancy, they are housed in “sow stalls” which are about the length and width of a fully grown sow and allow little movement.
Pigs are intelligent and social animals, and this confinement can cause stress and injury. There is evidence that other types of pig housing can also lead to stress and injury.
Before giving birth, sows are moved to a farrowing crate, where they remain until their piglets are weaned. Farrowing crates are designed to prevent mother pigs crushing the piglets. The mother pig has just enough room to lie down, meaning that her movement is severely restricted.
About 75% of pig production in Australia is now “sow stall-free”, after the pork industry introduced a voluntary phase-out of sow stalls. Coles brand pork products are sow stall-free, and Woolworths has committed to using stalls for less than 10% of the sow’s pregnancy (about 115 days).
In some countries, including New Zealand, sow stalls have been totally or partially banned by law. They are also banned in the ACT.
Confusingly, “sow stall-free” doesn’t mean that sows are free of all systems of confinement. Sows can spend up to five days in “mating stalls” after they have been mated (for Coles’ own brand products, it’s less than 24 hours). Sows are still housed in farrowing crates until their piglets are weaned.
There are some free-range Christmas hams in the major supermarkets this year. However, just 5% of the Australian pig herd is free range.
In free-range systems, such as the RSPCA-approved outdoor system and Australian pork certified free range, both sows and piglets live outside in paddocks. They have access to shelters, wallows and shade.
Sows in these free-range systems aren’t confined in sow stalls or farrowing crates, and can behave naturally.
Most large-scale free-range pig production takes place in the south of Western Australia, which has ideal soil, water and climate. Free-range pig farming is challenging in many parts of Australia, because of the hot climate.
Pig farming can also have environmental impacts. These include soil and water degradation from nutrient overload in manure.
You can buy free-range hams from farmers’ markets, specialist butchers and small-scale pig producers. When you buy at a farmers’ market, ask about how the pigs are raised and whether they are free range.
There are a few hams around labelled “outdoor bred, raised indoors on straw”. These were labelled “bred free range” until the ACCC took action against some producers for misleading and deceptive conduct.
Hams with this label come from production systems where the sows live outside. They live under free-range conditions and are not confined to sow stalls or farrowing crates.
Piglets are born outside, but are moved inside after weaning and raised in group pens on straw or other litter before being butchered for products including Christmas hams.
You can vote for better animal welfare by buying the most ethical ham you can afford, whether that’s a sow stall-free one from one of the major supermarkets or a free-range one from a small-scale producer at a farmers’ market.
Supermarkets are setting higher animal welfare standards for their own-brand pork after increasing customer interest. These higher standards have the potential to influence new Australian animal welfare standards and guidelines for pigs, which are likely to be developed in the next few years.
Up to two-thirds of processed pork (including ham and bacon) is imported as boneless frozen pork. If you want to buy an Australian ham, look for ham on the bone, a label such as “Made from 100% Australian pork”, or the square pink “Australian Pork” label.
If you’re looking for an ethical ham that also scores on taste, check out the Good Food Christmas ham taste test. Seven of the top 10 hams were from free-range pigs.

The world’s first contactless payment, self-service beer pump will be put to the test by consumers during the height of pre-Christmas partying in the UK’s bars and pubs.
Pay@Pump allows drinkers to order and pour their own pint and pay with a contactless card or device touched on a pad at the base of the pump.
The technology has been devised by Barclaycard – and a prototype designed and installed in a Central London pub, Henry’s Café Bar - to help reduce queuing time for customers buying drinks during busy periods.
The average waiting time at the bar during the Christmas party season is 12 minutes per order, according to research carried out for Barclaycard, totalling 35 minutes per person during a festive night out. Almost one in four (24%) of bar-goers admitted they had considered abandoning a drinks purchase because of long bar queues, while 20% have gone elsewhere when facing a lengthy wait.
“I’m sure everyone has been stuck behind the person who orders the most complicated cocktail on the menu or a round of 10 drinks for their group of friends,” said Tami Hargreaves, the commercial director, digital consumer payments, at Barclaycard. “When people told us that waiting time was one of their biggest annoyances, we wanted to help solve a common problem with a simple solution.”
The pump incorporates Barclaycard’s contactless technology and electronics to allow the beer supply to be regulated and turned on following successful payment. It is hoped it will be rolled out nationally next year, not only in bars and pubs but also at large music festivals and concerts to help speed up service.
One in five card payments by Britons are now contactless, a technology that launched in the UK in 2007. At that stage, tap-and-go or touch-and-go was largely confined to coffee shops and sandwich chains but is now widely available in shops and bars.

TV chef who apologised for not paying minimum wage says charge at Le Gavroche in London is treated ‘as revenue’
Sharia courts are a symptom rather than the cause of the problems many Muslim women face (Sharia courts have no place in UK family law, theguardian.com, 14 December). The real problem is that most mosques do not register themselves under the Marriage Act 1949 and imams are willing to perform marriage ceremonies without insisting on the marriage being registered. Muslim wives in particular are usually not aware that their “marriage” has no legal status until the relationship breaks down, and they discover that they are merely cohabitants with few rights and in that circumstance going to a sharia “court” may be the best option they have.
It is a criminal offence to solemnise a marriage that is not registered under the Marriage Act. If the government started enforcing that provision and ensured that all Muslim marriages are properly registered, that would achieve far more for Muslim women than yet another review of sharia courts.

• I never thought I’d agree with Norman Tebbit about anything, but his comments about sharia law – as mocked in (Pass notes, G2, 14 December) – are broadly accurate. As the work of One Law for All, the pressure group campaigning against the spread of sharia law, makes clear, sharia councils and courts act as quasi-judicial authorities, and although they have no status under civil law, many Muslims regard their decisions as binding. These decisions in the field of family law are highly discriminatory against women, and children are also at risk because decisions about residence and contact are made without reference to the Children Act. Crimes under the secular law of the state, such as marital rape, domestic abuse and polygamy, are accepted or even actively promoted. Would that all this were just a “popular myth”.

Whatever happened to convalescent homes (Letters, 7 and 15 December)? I was twice sent to such a place in 1954 and 1955, aged seven, following serious illness. It was 35 miles from my home and named after Jan Smuts, the South African nationalist leader, soldier and Calvinist. The naming was appropriate: it was run by methods that were, even by the standards of the day, harsh and spartan. Up at 6am in freezing cold, forced exercise, enforced naps and compulsory medication with some vile substance called “Radio Malt” daily, as well as other substances lost to memory, too awful to recall, and physical punishment. Kindness was not on the menu.
Parental visits were allowed once a week but they were not permitted inside. My family had no car and so my mother travelled hours by bus, every fortnight and, more than once, walked through snow with holes in her shoes, to feed me pork sandwiches at the gate – a taste of home.
The experience undoubtedly marked me, and many others, for life. Their passing should not be mourned.

Although Leonard Lewis – the hairdresser known professionally as “Leonard of Mayfair” – trained in Vidal Sassoon’s London salon in Bond Street, their approaches to hair and the people beneath it were irreconcilable. Sassoon treated locks as millinery felt, to be cut and sculpted into “hats”, uniformly imposed. Lewis, who has died aged 78, understood hair as organic, sensuous as fur, and that its owners might need psychological support more than a sharp shearing. “We’d discuss how you felt, what you wanted to be,” he told the style magazine Dazed in 2008. “Then we would achieve it, together. The only way hair works is between two people.”
Lewis could do fashion – in 1966 he cropped, and his colourist Daniel Galvin bleached, the schoolgirl Lesley Hornby, and the resultant photograph, hung in the salon, was enough to start her modelling career as Twiggy. He was an early volunteer to style fashion shoots in studios and locations, which most name hairdressers would not do, since it was unprofitable; in the fashion-wig era, from the mid-1960s, his extravaganzas were the wild best.
But Lewis’s sympathy was more important to celebrities, who embodied their own and others’ fantasies; he was discreet about Tony Curtis’s toupee, patient with Elizabeth Taylor’s hairpiece, calm when Mick and Bianca Jagger ranted in his salon. He unpicked and trimmed Bob Marley’s dreadlocks. If a client was not willing, he did not attempt to persuade. Margaret Thatcher’s advisers brought her in for a cut and “she wouldn’t let me touch a strand … that was how she would keep it”.
It cost him effort to ascend. He was born in west London, the unwanted fourth child of a shady car salesman, John Lewis, and his wife, Amelia, of Shepherd’s Bush. Leonard’s education was minimal and the real flash of inspiration came from a 1952 French film, Coiffure Pour Dames, that he saw at the Curzon, Mayfair (Lewis was obsessed with the area), with the comic Fernandel as a sheep-shearer who remakes himself into a stylist adored by Parisian society.
Lewis worked at auctions with his father, who knew many noted crooks, and as a labourer and barrow-boy, and saved enough to pay for three years of apprenticeship with Rose Evansky of Mount Street, who died last month. Boys of rough background were not usually accepted in Mayfair salons — the pinnacle of the UK trade, of near-Parisian glamour — but Lewis got in, and Evansky’s pioneering blow-drying influenced him. Lewis had a year at Sassoon, then set up a small salon on a bank overdraft in Duke Street in partnership with a fellow Sassoon defector, Raphael Santarossa. His final transition was to his Upper Grosvenor Street salon, The House of Leonard. The name was a bit much. So was the venue.
Lewis’s childhood had been dingy and cramped, and to rent five Georgian floors in Mayfair in his 20s was making it. He avoided the traditional local chandelier and frou-frou decor, aiming instead for the buzz of the new bistro restaurants, like his favourite, San Lorenzo – he was more chef-patron than maître-coiffure, despite his staff retinue. Lewis would listen to a client before starting to cut, then requested silence.
The top floor was opened as a barbershop for clients’ menfolk, Galvin’s radical colour experiments were given another floor, and the in-house chemist reformulated the bright textile dyes of the young Zandra Rhodes to apply to hair. She designed the salon’s gowns. Models – Marie Helvin, Jerry Hall — brought in music people (the Stones, Bowie in his Ziggy Stardust phase), who attracted the film folk (Warren Beatty, Audrey Hepburn, Liza Minnelli, Meryl Streep).
Lewis already had a connection to the movie world, as hairdresser to the women of the Carreras family, which owned the Hammer horror production company, and had worked on the films: “I just loved the theatricality, all the lights.” So he was up for Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) – Lewis offered his wigmaker to knot the ape-suits, and styled them, no different from toupee-shaping — and confected the high-frothed, pastel-tinted 18th-century wigs for Barry Lyndon (1975).
Kubrick didn’t want artifice for A Clockwork Orange (1971), so Lewis hacked its brutal proto-punk spikes on the actors for real. Much of the charm of The Boy Friend (1971) lies in Lewis’s sweet bob for Twiggy. Murder on the Orient Express (1974) was heavily Lewis-bewigged.
Lewis lived large and was a spendthrift: town house, country house, restaurants, clubbing. He had little financial acumen, was slow to open salons he could not personally supervise and did not see the future in the name-brand products that began to dominate rivals’ businesses.
In 1986 he collapsed in a Park Lane hotel – Mayfair, of course – and had successful surgery for a brain tumour. There followed alcoholism, bulimia and epilepsy. He was bankrupted, and he survived on income support in the home of his much older sister, until old colleagues, former trainees, and clients set up a trust to fund his nursing-home care. He kept his scissors, and a few friends, including Jack Nicholson, visited for a trim.
His first marriage, to the model Ricci Wade, ended in 1977; in 1980 he was briefly married to Petra Arzberger, who encouraged him to open branches in New York and Dubai.
Dominic, his son by Wade, survives him.
With champagne being promoted at anything between £9 and £126 this Christmas, it’s almost impossible to know what’s good value. OK, I can’t imagine many of you thinking that upwards of 100 quid for a single bottle is remotely a bargain, even with 10% off, but what about £30, say? Come to think of it, is it really worth paying anything more than a tenner?
The nearest parallels I can think of are trainers and perfume. There’s no actual need to buy branded products such as Nike or Chanel, but people do. Like other luxury goods, champagne is heavily promoted, and with the big brands, that’s what you’re paying for. Is Krug at £126 fourteen times better than Tesco’s Louis Delaunay, which was recently on offer at £9? Not for most of us, no, even if we could afford it. A case of the Wine Society’s own-label Champagne (12.5 abv) is a better deal than both: like Krug, it is aged in oak and you can order until midnight on Tuesday at the equivalent of £19.67 a bottle, saving yourself £59 in the process,
I recently re-tried some of the bargain-basement bubbly out there and wasn’t impressed. If you’re going to spend only £10 on champagne, you might as well drink cava. The sweet spot this year seems to be around £16, for which you can buy some perfectly decent, and in some cases excellent, supermarket fizz. Sainsbury’s Winemaker’s Selection Blanc de Blancs (12% abv), which was recently nominated a Which? best buy, is on offer at £16 at the moment, as is their Blanc de Noirs (12% abv). Which to choose depends on whether you like a fresher, more creamy style (the blanc de blancs) or a richer, toastier one.
Tesco’s Finest Premier Cru Champagne (on offer at £16; 12.5% abv) is more than drinkable, as is the Co-op’s Les Pionniers (12% abv), which makes a regular appearance in the column at this time of year. On special offer at £15.99, there’s no reason not to recommend it again. Interestingly, the best bottle I tasted from Lidl, its Champagne Comte de Senneval Grand Cru (12.5% abv) is £3 more expensive, which just goes to show that discounters don’t have all the bargains.
In terms of reductions on big names such as Bollinger, Laurent-Perrier, Pol Roger and Roederer, it’s simply a question of shopping around. I personally like Pol, as it’s known in the trade, and could be tempted by the chance to pick up a bottle at the Co-op at its current price of £29.99 (12% abv). But look online and ring around: there are almost always discounts for a case – Chichester-based L’Assemblage, for instance, generally has some good deals.

Finally, a re-advent we can all get behind: Kim Kardashian’s arse is back! And before you say: “Oh I know, I saw him in the lobby of Trump Tower,” – I’m talking about her literal one, not her metaphorical one. The manner in which Kanye opts to recover from his breakdown is a matter as private as it is idiosyncratic.
As for Kim, you may be aware that she has observed a 10-week social media silence, following the Paris burglary in which she had a gun held to her head, before being gagged and thrown into a bathtub, while thieves robbed her of millions of dollars’ worth of jewellery. Since then, there has been all sorts of conjecture that she was totally overhauling her image as a consequence.
Happily, this distinctly censorious speculation appears to have been unfounded. Madam has this week broken her social media silence by posting some mesmeric footage of her own gyrating backside, and a still photo of what appears to be her cleavage resting on someone else’s bottom. The only text accompanying them teases: “December 16th”. I can probably wait to find out what it all means, but still: welcome back, old stick!
Needless to say, that view is not universally shared. The most toxic reaction to this comes from pointless überblogger Perez Hilton, who has always excelled at turning fluffy showbiz gossip into a form of creepy bigotry. (Possibly the only hatreds Perez is convincingly against would be homophobia and Hispanophobia, for the simple reason that they affect him personally.)
“I was expecting so much more from your return to social media,” he opines in an open message to Kim. “Sad. Sad. Sad. After your ‘traumatic’ Paris robbery, THIS is how you return to Instagram? Clearly nothing’s changed.”
And yet, what should have changed? I think Kim probably already knew that aggravated burglary was a bad thing before it happened to her. Still, it is always instructive to hear from the high sparrow of drawing cocks onto women’s faces, and we must wish Perez the compliments of the season.
If you were concerned that forced funerals for fetuses and zygotes wasn’t quite horrific enough, rejoice! In the last week, Ohio has passed a law banning abortions after 20 weeks and Oklahoma wants to mandate that businesses post anti-abortion signs in women’s public restrooms.
In the wake of Trump’s win, reproductive rights opponents have not wasted a moment in their plan to roll back access to abortion and birth control. And, as has been the case for some time, these harmful policies are being presented as wins for women.
When Governor John Kasich of Ohio passed the 20-week ban, for example, he also vetoed a six-week ban – the hope being that the move would be seen as moderate in comparison. But 20 weeks is around the time that women find out about fetal abnormalities – a leading reason for later abortions. And while the Oklahoma plan is being touted by pro-life groups as a way to offer women “alternatives”, what it’s really doing is shaming women and requiring that businesses spend money on ideological propaganda. (Also, so much for the Republicans caring about women’s privacy in bathrooms!)
The research is clear: women suffer when you deny them access to birth control and abortion. In fact, despite anti-choice rhetoric to the contrary, the only kind of negative mental health impact that abortion has on women occurs when someone seeks out the procedure and is denied.
The challenge we have in front of us, though, is not just the danger of Trump’s administration or the emboldening of Republicans. In a time when bad news for progress is around every corner – as Slate writer Jamelle Bouie put it, “what disaster to write about today?” – we have to make that sure that women’s rights don’t get lost in the shuffle.
It wasn’t so long ago that gender and race were considered ancillary or distracting topics in progressive politics – a notion still being bandied about as people blame “identity politics” and “political correctness” for Trump’s win. If history is any indication, it won’t be long before we start hearing murmurings from so-called progressives that women should sacrifice working on issues that affect them in service of “the greater good”.
It’s vital that we not forget or lose the momentum feminism has had over the last decade, especially on reproductive rights. The stakes are just too high. Hundreds of thousands of American women have already sought out illegal abortions, in part because of state-level restrictions. And as the Affordable Care Act comes under fire, it could leave millions without coverage for contraception.
These are not small things, these are not side issues or special interests. Women’s ability to control their bodies and plan their family size is a human rights issue. And while we have a tremendous amount of work to do on so many fronts, Americans cannot afford to treat feminism and women’s progress as something that can be pushed aside for a time and picked up later. Let’s not allow our the fact that we’re overwhelmed to get the better of us – not now, and not for the next four years. 
Louise Haigh, MP for Sheffield Heeley, told parliament she was targeted after calling for a debate on the banning of Britain First, the far-right group which may have inspired the murder of her colleague Jo Cox.
She told the Guardian such threats were becoming commonplace among female MPs, noting that Cox’s successor in parliament, Tracy Brabin, had received “horrific levels” of abuse.
Speaking in a Commons debate on Wednesday night, Haigh said: “I just called for the house to be given evidence and to look at the details of the group’s paramilitary activity and anti-democratic behaviour. As a result of that and of how the media covered my call, I have received very explicit death threats. I have been called a traitor and a Muslim lover.
“On Friday, an individual went through every one of my YouTube videos and said he would not rest until I was murdered. If that is not evidence that Britain First should be proscribed as a terrorist organisation, I am not sure what is.”
Haigh, who at 29 is the youngest Labour MP in the House of Commons, said she was disappointed with the initial reaction from police when she reported the abuse.
She said she first told a special police unit situated in parliament designed to deal with such investigations. “Their reaction was: ‘South Yorkshire police need to deal with this.’ We reported it to SYP and the initial reaction was pretty dismissive: ‘It is really difficult to find people on the internet.’”
The MP said SYP only seemed to start actively investigating after she told the media about the threats, though they were quick to install panic alarms in her Sheffield home and office, and to provide her with uniformed and undercover protection while going about constituency business over the weekend. The force has now put in a request to Google for IP information, she said.
“I didn’t think they were going to act until the media attention. I don’t know what it would take to make them act. The same group [Britain First] inspired the murder of Jo, one force over [the border in West Yorkshire],” she said.
Haigh said she shrugged off the threats at first. She said: “My initial reaction was to treat it as fairly usual: I get really abusive messages all the time. But reflecting on how obsessive the individual seemed, and the specific obvious threats of murdering me, it did really affect me. I didn’t really feel safe until I came down to London on Monday.
“SYP was really good at offering resources to protect me, had cars following me at roving surgery and undercover police at events. But I would really rather they put resources into investigating.”
Following the parliamentary debate, Ben Wallace, the minister of state for security at the Home Office, said he would intervene, Haigh said.
Being abused was now part and parcel of life as a female politician in the UK, she said. “For women it’s definitely depressingly familiar,” she said. “Speaking to male colleagues they just don’t seem to receive the same level or magnitude of abuse I get on a fairly regular basis. But it’s nothing compared with some colleagues, like Jess Phillips [MP for Birmingham Yardley]. I know Tracy Brabin has had horrific levels. We do become accustomed to it and we shouldn’t. I worry that it will put some women off coming into politics.”
Brabin told the Guardian she had received abuse on social media in response to her efforts to champion diversity in her constituency of Batley and Spen and had asked the members of her local Labour party to respond by retweeting the positive things on her Twitter page. She has also had abuse by post, which one of her researchers has spoken to the police in the House of Commons about.
Brabin said she would support her fellow female MPs however they chose to respond to such abuse, but she was trying not to let any of it get to her and had not made formal complaints to the police. “Everybody deals with it in their own way, but I particularly cannot afford to let it affect what I do because I wouldn’t get out of bed,” she said.
A spokeswoman for South Yorkshire police confirmed that the force received a report of malicious communication in the early hours of 9 December. She said: “The force takes reports of this nature extremely seriously and inquiries are ongoing in relation to this matter.”
The current debate about the ever-growing pressure on social care services is by no means the first, and certainly won’t be the last. But it is always predicated around the same central assumption: with increasing numbers of older people, the costs can only go up. This is to miss an important point, one well known to public health experts but strangely ignored by most politicians. The problem isn’t just about an ageing population, it’s also about an increasingly sedentary one.
That far too many Britons are not physically active is well documented, even if the sheer extent can sometimes be surprising. For example, a fifth of Scottish people say they have not walked for more than 20 minutes even once over the past year. Not once. Also well known, if less discussed, is the toll this takes on the public health. The usual estimate is that about 85,000 people die early each year in England and Wales due to illnesses caused by sedentary living, mainly heart disease, type 2 diabetes and various cancers.
But callous as it sounds, what really keep senior civil servants awake at night isn’t the mortality rate; it’s the parallel issue known as morbidity: the quality of life people can expect as they age, and thus how independent they remain. Here, the near-magical effects of keeping up even a fairly minimal regime of exercise are also well documented.
Physical activity keeps people stronger and more supple as they age. It also improves balance, gives better bone density and makes them less likely to be depressed or develop Alzheimer’s. These are all things associated with needing less social care.
The earlier people start such a regime, the better the effect into older age. One public health expert once told me he encourages people this way: “I tell them, ‘being active throughout your life is about being able to get to the loo on time in your old age’. They can get their heads around that.”
If it’s so conclusive, why is the government not pushing this as part of the solution? Here we get into the more tricky area of what is politically acceptable, and whether ministers want to embark on what is, in effect, low-scale social engineering. Decades of experience has shown that just encouraging people to exercise has limited impact. Urging people to go to a gym or walk briskly round their local park eats into what is known to experts as “discretionary time” – when they could be doing something else. Thus they tend to give up pretty soon.
One of the few exercise regimes proved to stick is active travel, more specifically making walking or cycling to work, school or the shops sufficiently safe and convenient that it becomes easier for people to do it than not. Cycling is arguably the mode that should be encouraged the most. Aside from the fact people can cover greater distances on a bike than on foot, studies have shown that the slightly greater exertion it involves brings even more miraculous health benefits.
The mechanics of how you nudge people away from cars and on to bikes is another discussion, but there is little doubt it can be done if the political will is there. The Netherlands and Denmark, for example, have spent decades very deliberately re-shaping their road environments away from the car culture of the 1960s and 70s towards mass cycling. It’s not an accident.
Yes, it would take the UK a decade or so to make similar changes. But given the vast and unquestioned public health benefits on offer, with the huge savings this would bring on social care (not to mention the NHS, which some experts predict will soon become bankrupt due to the costs of ailments linked to sedentary lives), it’s a bit depressing that we haven’t even begun the debate.
For all the occasionally hysterical media narrative on cycling, it barely exists as an issue at the top of government. In his first interview as transport secretary last week, Chris Grayling spoke of cyclists only to complain about those who jumped red lights and to suggest that bike lanes caused problems for “road users”, a group that apparently doesn’t include people on bikes.
Grayling’s predecessor in the job, Philip Hammond, now the chancellor, was reported last month to have urged London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, to rip out one of the few properly designed and safe bike lanes in the entire country. This is not to castigate the pair personally. Barring a handful of exceptions, almost all Britain’s top politicians think much the same about cycling as everyday transport.
The debate on social care shows how blinkered this is. As part of a book I’ve been writing about the beneficial effects of more cycling, I spoke to a number of public health experts about the problem of sedentary living. Several of them used the same analogy: getting people active in their everyday lives is, they said, like “a miracle pill” in the way it wards off disease and decrepitude. That miracle pill is well known. We’re just waiting for someone with the political vision to administer it.

If, like me, you enjoyed Andrew Lloyd Webber’s recent observation that the theatre is “hideously white”, you will have loved his turn on breakfast telly this week, where he mentioned that he’d almost discovered Rihanna “about 12 years ago”.
As it goes, it was almost exactly 12 years ago that Rihanna was signed to a six-album deal with Def Jam, on the rapturous recommendation of the label’s then president, Jay Z. I can’t help thinking a straight signing fight between Lord Lloyd Webber and Jay Z would be a plotline too high-camp even for Empire, the Dynasty of our day. But as it turns out, that wasn’t how Andrew remembers it all anyway.
Over to him. “I saw her singing karaoke in Sandy Lane hotel in Barbados 12 years ago,” his lordship told Good Morning Britain. “I turned to my friend and said, ‘She’s very good.’ I wondered if we brought her back, it might be like a picture you buy on holiday and then you get home and think, why did I buy that? I thought I might get her home and wonder what to do with her.”
Well now. As a side issue, I love the way Andrew thinks he’s universalising this moment by comparing it to that totally relatable rose-tinted holiday mistake: the one where you buy an adorable local painting that ends up looking naff when you get it back to Chelsea. Clearly, what he should instead have compared potential acquisitions like Rihanna to is a bottle of the spirit from wherever it is you’re holidaying. You know the sort of thing: tastes like ambrosia on those long hot nights; drink it anywhere in UK airspace and it relieves you of your epiglottis.
The main event, however, is clearly Lloyd Webber’s hilariously excruciating implication that Barbados is still a place from where a powerful British person brings back what they choose – be it a naive painting, a woman of colour, or the deeds to a sugar plantation.
I don’t want to go out on a limb here, but I can’t help feeling Rihanna had a lucky escape not being “discovered” by Andrew. Perhaps we’ll never pinpoint the exact timing of his noticing of her in relation to the moment she was in fact signed to Def Jam. Either way, it’s probably for the best that she didn’t bin them off to accompany Andrew back to the West End, presumably on the promise of starring in a yet-to-be-written period musical called something like Sugar Daddy. Even if he had assured her that the clever thing is that it turns out to be a love story about the slave liberating the owner, rather than the other way round.
I’m writing under the bedcovers, metaphorically speaking. I’m supposed to be on paternity leave but don’t like the idea of not doing this column, so I’m working in a few snatched moments between nappy changes and feeds. Nonetheless I’m keeping my promise to stay at home and so am taking a break from all the activity of the church in the run-up to Christmas. Not only that, but my mother-in-law is over from Tel Aviv to coo over her new grandchild and take charge of the kitchen. And with her arrival, the common language of the vicarage has shifted to Hebrew, with me struggling to keep up. All of which draws my attention to something that sociologists of religion often remark upon: that many of the great liturgies and festivals of Judaism centre on the home in a way that they do not with catholic Christianity – Christmas being the only possible exception.
With catholic Christianity – and that includes my part of the C of E – religion is for church. Very occasionally, I say prayers before meal times. Usually, it has to be said, when we have the bishop round for supper. And when a parishioner is too ill to make it to Sunday service, I take the eucharist to them at home. But all this is small beer compared with the wealth of liturgical and semi-liturgical stuff that goes on in the Jewish home: from the three-line whip of eating at home on shabbat, to the grand meal of the passover seder, from the ceremony of circumcision (traditionally performed at home unless too many people want to come), to sitting shiva for the dead.
When Jews fix the mezuzah on the doorpost of their home, they are declaring their homes holy in a way that Christians rarely do. And while Jewish weddings don’t commonly take place at home, they do take place under the chuppah, which symbolises the home. This year, the festival of Hanukah begins on Christmas Eve, which further emphasises the contrast. My wife will light Hanukah candles at home. I will light Christmas candles in church.
One common explanation for the catholic emphasis on church as opposed to home is that catholic Christianity maintained a firm distinction between the sacred and the profane. To be holy was to be set apart. To be a priest was not to be involved with worldly stuff. God was seen as more intensely present in special places and at special times.
What dramatically changed all this was the Reformation and the rejection of the idea that the church is the middleman between human beings and God. With the Bible in the vernacular, you could read about God at home and not have to be told about God in church. This sucks power away from the church and begins its relocation to the home.
Thus George Herbert could write, in 1633, words that became a much-loved hymn: “A servant with this clause makes drudgery divine: who sweeps a room as for Thy laws makes that and th’ action fine.” With the Reformation, the profane makes a religious comeback.
In his magisterial Sources of the Self, the philosopher Charles Taylor calls this shift in sensibility “the affirmation of ordinary life” and links it to the Protestant deification of profane work, the Protestant work ethic, and ultimately as setting the scene for capitalism. For as God broke out of his imprisonment in churches, he came to be seen not just in the profane home but also in profane work. Thus hard work, making money work, previously distinguished from God’s holy work done by religious people, came to be invested with some higher religious purpose.
But this affirmation of profane work became too successful. For even when secularisation took God out of the picture, the Protestant idea persisted that not working hard enough is some sort of secular sin or moral failing. And now we are slaves to that idea. Which is why I’m going to enjoy a guilt-free paternity leave, messing around with my son, eating my mother-in-law’s borscht and lighting our candles. My Jewish relatives are all secular Israelis – yet it is they, not I, who have introduced religious liturgies into our house. And I thank them for bringing God home. Happy Chrismukah.

To the career of Nicole Scherzinger, now, and a reminder that unlike the rest of us, actors never take jobs for a payday. They are better than that. There is almost always a desire to educate and inform the benighted public about a moral issue close to the star’s heart. How else do you think things like ABC’s sensationally unnecessary Dirty Dancing reboot get made?
It is certainly what prompted the former Pussycat Doll singer’s decision to refuse whatever other offers may have been out there – anyone? - in favour of playing Penny in the forthcoming drama. Now, if you don’t watch Dirty Dancing biannually while getting wasted with six girlfriends, I should probably remind you that Penny is the resort dance pro who gets pregnant by a no-good chancer of a waiter, and ends up having a backstreet abortion, the complications of which are eventually sorted out by Baby’s doctor father.
Alas, the offer of this role put Nicole in a corner. You see, as she is at pains to stress, she is profoundly anti-abortion. “I was like a crazy thing,” she reflects, “because my family … my papa’s a bishop and my family’s really hardcore against abortion. So I got the role and I almost didn’t take it because I didn’t want to promote abortion, because my character has an abortion.”
If you’re wondering how Nicole managed to square taking this high-profile, lucrative role that finally allows her to graduate from talent-show judging and move decisively into acting, she can explain. “I was like, hopefully they can learn from, you know, her ways, and I can be a positive influence.”
“Her ways”? Oof. Nothing says “well-rounded character” like a performance specifically delivered to remind us that with their “ways”, little tramps like Penny always end up getting what they deserve. Even so, Nicole is anxious to eliminate any last vestige of doubt you may have that she is playing someone who is 100% in the wrong here. As she puts it: “I just want to encourage everyone to, you know, keep their babies.”
Also, to cast her in things in future. That said, Nicole didn’t get to the decision without the help of her family. Her grandfather prayed on it, apparently, and got the green light from God. Though she doesn’t reveal the Almighty’s exact words on the matter, they were clearly something along the lines of: “I think Nicole should deffo take the part, which is to My glory, though can you ask them to change it so that Penny has the baby and has to marry the horrendous amoral prick of a waiter? If that’s not doable, can it be clear that at the end of the movie, Penny is cast from the Kellerman’s firmament to the moral hellfires of New York, where she maybe dies penniless, unloved, and of a her-ways-related illness at some point in the 70s?”
San Francisco after midnight is a night stroller’s dream. I lived there for 25 years and would often take a short nap and go out at midnight to enjoy a sleeping city filled with atmosphere, deserted spaces, panoramic vistas, foggy and forlorn images of trees and distant expanse of water. Time was different at night in sleeping San Francisco.
The city was so crowded during the day I could not enjoy it, I had no sense of presence. At night the real city is laid bare, seemingly forgotten and empty, even while occupying the same physical space of the daytime city. I came to think of the city after midnight as “night city” with its own culture and realities. I found it inviting. (Anonymous)
I can remember some magical late night London walks home from parties in the mid-1970s – a time of hot summers and low rainfall. These were often out of necessity as late night transport was pretty much non-existent at the time, and I was young and too impoverished to pay for a taxi or minicab. I lived off Ladbroke Grove and these walks would usually take me through the squares of Bayswater or Holland Park – the trees luminescent in the streetlights or along the edge of Hyde Park with the dew starting to fall. These walks stay with me today – probably some of my happiest times ever. (montesdeoca)
It’s a wonderful sensation, going out in the dark, and having the city gradually reveal itself. I’ve enjoyed it most in places which are crowded during the day; Venice, for example, is magical before dawn. (SuperbMeteor)
I walk miles in Athens at night and love it. Especially around the Acropolis, through Plaka and Thissio. There is a dirt track between the two agoras which hardly anyone uses at night. It’s very peaceful, and Athens is a very safe city. Walking in the daytime here can be a nightmare. I still love this city though, and walking through it at night is one of my favourite pastimes – especially in winter when the streets are so very quiet. (David Coxon)
The best part of exploring a city at night is the slight sense of being in an alternate world. The night smells different. You can sometimes hear underground streams flowing. It’s nice to be rewarded with the discovery of new places even if it’s only an all-night cafe. Wildlife is everywhere, particularly foxes but also urban owls, badgers and deer. I am something of an insomniac. My sleep pattern is very disrupted but I just embrace it. (Anonymous)
I would love to go running at night, but as a woman I’d never run the risk of going for a walk or run alone at night because I’ve just been always taught to believe I must always be vigilant and not put myself in danger. If I did go for a walk at night and was attacked, I fear the reaction from others would be that I shouldn’t have been walking alone in the first place. (koelner)
When I first moved to London, I worked as a bartender in Shoreditch, usually until 1 or 3am. The noise left my veins tingling, my head buzzing for hours afterwards. Sober, the night bus felt like a continuation of the night shift, a busman’s holiday full of late night drinkers and cans of lager. So, although it took almost an hour, I often walked home to unwind from the buzz of London’s nightlife – to decompress, to breathe.
Walking from Shoreditch to Upper Clapton, I discovered a different side to my new city, a quieter side. A London of sleeping tower blocks, peaceful parks, street lamps twinkling in the night. In its own way, the commute was actually quite a privilege. Few people are able to walk home from their jobs, and London at night is infinitely more beautiful than a view of someone’s armpit on the Tube.
Night walks are an excellent tonic for the stress and busyness of London, and a break from our increasingly digital lives. Approached with curiosity and openness, a night walk can be just as compelling as a TV box set before bed, and more nourishing than your smartphone’s news feed. Night walking gives me a fresh perspective on a city that has now become familiar, and when I make time for it, I always sleep better. (Emma Cummins)
I love that at night the city is empty (or emptier) and therefore feels like it’s yours. I love that the light is beautiful, even on a bright Scandinavian summer night; that you feel outside of the world. I have worked as a tram driver in Oslo, working until 1.30am or starting at 4.30am. I have seen the city go to sleep and awake many times. I’ve seen people going for their morning run in complete darkness, and the birds eating kebab leftovers on Sunday morning before the street cleaners arrive; I’ve seen tired people coming home from late evening shifts, watching warily out of the window. I have seen many beautiful sunsets and sunrises at wildly different times. (Anonymous)
I love the neon whirl of Shanghai during a night stroll through older parts of the city just west of the Bund, teeming with old neighbourhoods winding down for the evening. In the midst of all the activity, there is always this sense of calm. (Gordon Steel)
I fall in love with London more and more when exploring at night. In my teenage years, London at night was how I discovered it independently for the first time – how I really made it my city. At night you’re free to walk to places you otherwise wouldn’t go – because fewer people means more space, and partly because you’re not being watched. You have to find your own entertainment at night when everything is closed, and so you explore more. In some ways I can appreciate cities more once I know about them at after dark. Daytime London (or any other city) is only half of what the place has to offer. It’s a giant playground after dark – especially in the early hours. I’d hate to only know a city based on experiences during the day. (Bmorris)
After sunset at Amsterdam’s phantasmagorical Leidseplein the throngs of nocturnal revellers bask in the neon glow radiating from various bars and coffee shops. To wade into this mass, to pass through, offers the nocturnal walker solitude in a sea of strangers. One can hide in plain sight.
The night reveals a fantastical Amsterdam. If the night owl was to walk 10 minutes away from Leidseplein, to banish the bright lights to the rear view mirror, they would be greeted with canals and beautiful houses. Over water, humped bridges arch, bejewelled with delicate lights while spanning the murky straights. By day, brown, by night, black and silver, the water of Van Gogh.
The interplay of the soft light with the last vestiges of autumnal foliage drastically alters the old city’s essence, transporting the night walker to a different Amsterdam.
The night walk is a free experience, and one out of the ordinary in the environment where capital rules all. For one to turn a corner and witness the unfurling of a canal, touched by the moonlight, soundtracked by a keen breeze, is an experience that warms the soul on cold winter nights. (Will Brown)
I spent four years living in Seoul and currently live in Tokyo. I’m a writer and I find I get so much inspiration from the ebb and flow of these grand megacities in the night-time. I love wandering between districts, finding the hidden connections between stops on the subway lines of these sprawling metropolises, and all the hidden neighbourhoods and goings-on that exist in between. (Haydn Wilks)
If there was anything that defined college years in Bucharest, those were the nocturnal walks when we entered courtyards, took elevators up and down, peeked shamelessly inside the illuminated homes, explored palaces, gypsy sheds, artists’ workshops, embassies, rooftops and squatted buildings. We entered everywhere we found a door open or someone awake and weird enough to let us in. On the longest night we got sequestered in a newspaper’s office by a limp guard who threatened us with handcuffs. He ended up making us sandwiches in exchange for stories about Che Guevara. (Anonymous)
The night is the best time to walk anywhere. The deep shadows cast by overhead lamps turn the most ordinary scene into a Cartier-Bresson magical print, eerie and atmospheric. I can walk against the cold night air, becoming a character from a movie; my high heels click and echo against the closed doors and windows, my thoughts my own. I can become anyone, anywhere, observing, reciting poetry in my head, looking at the stars. I don’t have to be cold and lonely inside. At night I can walk by myself and be anyone. (Anonymous)
Prague is a safe and well-lit city with little crime or major safety issues, but one of the great highlights of walking my dogs at 1am in Vinohrady just above the main train station is the wonderful terrifying vibe of the panthers on Italska Street. Yes, among the tenements, villas and the large Riegrovy Sady Park, reside two large panthers beside a tennis court. Sometimes you can meet them on the street being walked and at other times, in the pure still of the night, just a few hundred metres from the centre of the town, the silence is ripped apart by a large throaty panther scream. Got to love that! (Andrew Mann)
I continue to wander the streets of my city at night, despite warnings that I could be putting myself in danger. I feel absolutely safe by myself in the darkness. On the rare occasions I do come across another nocturnal wanderer, we seemingly glide past one another, each in their own safe and soft cushion of darkness. The darkness is kind to me and my anxieties. It is not ostentatious, but subtle and unobtrusive. (Anonymous)
Cities reveal themselves differently at night than they do during the day. The day brings cities and their full agglomerative forces out to bare, and can overwhelm as much as fascinate. Details get lost in the fullness of the city. At night, the city is clothed, austere, and, in some ways, just as we are at night, more playful and imaginative. The stillness of the post-bar, pre-cafe hours amplifies the scale and ambitions of urban life. Only when absent of population can one understand cities truly are mankind’s greatest invention.
I lived for sometime in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. There – outside of a few drinking dens – the nightlife revolves around roadside food and tea stalls, roaming men with guitars, and motorbikes. Strict residential gender segregation forces amorousness into the city’s public spaces. Food can be found throughout the night, and any local student has a thick mental map of what time, and how spicy, the food stalls open at 3am are.
Last summer, I delivered the weekly alternative newspaper from the hours of 2.45am until 6am on Wednesday mornings in downtown Portland. Using my nauseous and sleep-deprived body in the crisp summer air, I would work myself into a strange funk of constant menial mental calculations, routing strategies, and memory excavations. For those few hours, the world was just the city and me and my memories. In our distracted and efficient and busy city life it’s amazing how many memories we all have across urban landscapes that get lost under posts, emails, and Google map suggestions. And how much can shine through, come out of nowhere, and smack you – if you let it.
Working at night made me see the city in a way I hadn’t since I begrudgingly accepted other people existed, at about age seven. Cities excite me in their vibrancy, diversity, density, and exaggerations of human capability. But, I love most their potential for fleeting and totally thrilling, solitude. (Braden Bernards)

Mistletoe is, as National Geographic remarked last year, “everyone’s favourite parasite”, although the pedant in me has to point out that it’s actually a hemiparasite, because as well as ligging nutrients off its host plant via a connecting organ known as the haustorium, mistletoe does provide some of its own energy via photosynthesis.
The term mistletoe is a catch-all for a number of different plants around the world - many related, some not - but the UK native is Viscum album. Don’t be alarmed if you’ve never seen any where you live; its geographical spread across the UK is patchy and it is absent from some areas altogether. If you want to seek some out, mistletoe favours apple trees, limes, maples and poplars, although it can be found on other trees too. If you can’t find any real mistletoe, you could invest in the mistletoe cactus (Rhipsalis baccifera) as a hanging houseplant and steal a snog under that instead.
For a whole host of information on mistletoe myth and legend, plus practical details of how to grow it in your own garden, go to Jonathan Briggs’ Mistletoe Pages site. And for more on mistletoe and other (hemi)parasites read our rare plant blogger Robbie Blackhall-Miles’ latest post. And I recorded a podcast about festive plants last December, which includes a segment on mistletoe. Listen here.
Unlike mistletoe, ivy is not a parasite, despite its bad reputation among many gardeners: it photosynthesises and gains nutrients from roots buried in the ground, not from a tree. As Rosemary FitzGerald writes in A Gardener’s Guide to the Native Plants of Britain and Ireland, “it is considered to be the home-owner’s enemy and undesirable in gardens”.
And yet it is a fantastic plant for wildlife, a wonderful evergreen screen and a powerful symbol in art and culture, although its role as a festive decoration has been fading in the last few decades. It has many advantages over holly, though - it’s more widely and freely available, doesn’t spike you as you try to arrange it, and is easy to manipulate into swags, wreaths and any other shape you can think of. If you want to delve into the meaning of the popular carol The Holly and the Ivy, start with this piece in the Financial Times by Jan Dalley. And you can read our columnist Alys Fowler’s defence of ivy as a garden plant here. (We’ll look at the holly in part two of this series.)
In her book The Green Tapestry, Essex plantswoman Beth Chatto recommends ivy as ground cover in dry, shady spots; under a dense tree, perhaps. She writes: “I had a long bare bank of clay at one end of the long shady border which I have completely buried beneath shawls of different forms of ivy.”
Or should I say Helleborus niger, for as anyone who grows this plant in their garden knows, it very rarely flowers at Christmas, and isn’t a rose. Those pesky common plant names, eh? The wonder of this plant is that it boasts the biggest flowers of all the hellebores; pure white blooms that push up from the soil ahead of the leaves from January on.
Despite its reluctance to flower at Christmas in gardens, it is easily obtained as a pot plant in bud now, so you can enjoy the flowers on December 25. You can risk bringing it inside into a cool environment for a few days, but don’t leave it too long to send it back to its preferred habitat outside; or just place it on an outside table you can see from a window, or by the front door.
Growing H. niger in a large pot isn’t such a bad idea, as it prefers fertile but well-drained soil that doesn’t get boggy over winter; it also means the petals won’t get splashed with mud.
We all love a few Brassica oleracea Gemmifera Group on our plates at Christmas, don’t we? I may be stretching the theme a little here, but sprouts are foliage, after all. Sprout “stalks” have become the trendy way to buy your sprouts in the last few years, which has at least educated people about what part of the plant brussels sprouts come from (they’re buds, but you knew that, right?).
They aren’t the easiest vegetables to grow for yourself, either. Like most members of the brassica family, they are long-season plants that need to be sown in February or March and planted out in early summer to limber up for a winter harvest. Sprout plants take up a lot of room, and if the tall stalks aren’t firmed into the ground sufficiently, the sprouts can “blow” - in other words, fail to form the tight balls we expect. If this is a problem - or perhaps you just don’t like sprouts, give kalettes a try - these kale-sprout hybrids were bred by Tozer Seeds as an alternative to the sprout, and naturally grow in a loose formation.
Not only is sage a vital ingredient of the Christmas classic, sage and onion stuffing, its fragrant, evergreen leaves are also a wonderful addition to a homemade Christmas wreath, a table centrepiece with candles, or simply stuck in a vase with some silvery eucalyptus leaves, bay branches and rosemary. I’d also urge you to try herb guru Jekka McVicar’s wonderful crispy sage, apple and walnut salad from her book Jekka’s Herb Cookbook.
Sage is also reputed to have health-giving properties - you name a condition, and there’s probably an anecdote that Salvia officinalis treats it, although you should bear in mind that not all of this is proven scientifically. As Caroline Holmes points out in her book RHS Herbs for the Gourmet Gardener, this reputation is the origin of the Arab proverb “How can a man die who has sage in his garden?”
In the garden, sage likes full sun and well-drained soil; the best way to promote fresh growth is to prune it right back every spring, rather than letting it get too leggy and woody. Purple sage, Salvia officinalis ‘Purpurascens’ is particularly pretty, especially if grown alongside its green relative. If you don’t want to plant it in a dedicated herb bed, it looks lovely underplanting roses along with lavender.
Roman citizens have been willing to give their mayor, Virginia Raggi, the benefit of the doubt throughout her short and rocky tenure, fully aware that hers is probably one of the toughest jobs in Italy.
But even patient Romans could not contain their ire following the unveiling of the city’s official Christmas tree, a sad-looking fir in the centre of Piazza Venezia that was dubbed the “austerity tree” for its minimalist decor. Lacking even a star on top, let alone a shiny bauble or two, the pitiful spectacle drove Romans to express their disappointment on social media.
One person wrote on Rome’s Facebook page: “It would have been better to not put anything up rather than that horror. Then you wonder why tourists choose other cities.”
For some, it was a sign of the times. Raggi is a member of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), which is a vocal opponent of wasteful spending and any appearance of using taxpayer funds for vanity projects.
One news report suggested that even the children who excitedly joined Raggi in a countdown when the tree was lit last week were disappointed by the sparse decorations. On Facebook, a mock eBay ad for the fir priced it at €15,000 (£12,500) and joked that it had not been viewed by anyone except two dogs.
To add insult to injury, a video surfaced online comparing Rome’s tree to its majestic rivals across Italy, from Turin to Naples. Of these, none was more painful to behold than the glittering and towering tree in Milan, which was sponsored by Pandora, a Copenhagen-based jeweller.
Much closer to home, the 25-metre-tall tree in St Peter’s Square was – in keeping with Pope Francis’s ecological views – decorated by ceramic ornaments made by children in hospitals and lit by 18,000 environmentally friendly LED lights.
The anger in Rome was so palpable that Raggi was forced to respond this week. On Wednesday night, she addressed the furore on Facebook, even as more serious issues – including an abuse of office investigation into a top city councillor who has just resigned – dominated the headlines.
“The Romans want a more beautiful Christmas tree in Piazza Venezia. And they will have it,” she wrote, saying she had ordered more lights and decorations for the tree, although she added that it would still reflect a mood of “sobriety”.
“In past years, there has been a lot of waste … on the backs of citizens,” she wrote. “We have decided to change course: the tree was a gift to the city of Rome, which only cost us transportation and installation.”
By Wednesday night, the tree had been spruced up, with a large star now fixed on top.
However, not everyone was happy. On the Roma fa schifo (Rome is disgusting) Facebook page, a dedicated chronicler of the city’s decay, one post complained that, before the upgrade, Rome at least had the honour of hosting the “ugliest tree in the world”.
“Now we have a normal tree, as if it were Civitavecchia,” it said, referring to the gritty port city not far from Rome.

Lady Gaga has told how she was raped at the age of 19 by a man 20 years her senior. “I suffer from PTSD,” she said in a Today show interview on the US network NBC. “I’ve never told anyone that before.” On Saturday, on Twitter, Piers Morgan tweeted a CNN piece headlined “Lady Gaga: ‘I have PTSD’” with his response: “No, soldiers returning from battlefields do. Enough of this vain-glorious nonsense.” He followed this with another tweet to his 5.3 million followers – “I come from a big military family. It angers me when celebrities start claiming ‘PTSD’ about everything to promote themselves” – before casting doubt on the experiences of sexual assault described by both Lady Gaga and Madonna. The two performers “have both made ALLEGATIONS of rape many years after the event,” he wrote. “No police complaint, no charges, no court case.”
These comments and their trickle-down effect are dangerous for many reasons, and they need to be addressed not just with dissenting voices, but with facts. Because on the subject of PTSD – post-traumatic stress disorder – Morgan seems to be bafflingly ignorant.
This is a complex condition, as Lady Gaga has pointed out. (She has agreed to an interview with Morgan to discuss the issue, but has suggested she will pull out and speak to someone else, if he continues to publicly shame her.)
We can infer from Morgan’s comments that he believes PTSD to be specifically – perhaps solely – a condition affecting those in the military. This is not even within whispering distance of fact. “PTSD is a form of mental distress that can affect all sections of society,” says Sue Baker, the director of Time to Change, a UK campaign that aims to end stigma around mental health. “People of all statuses, ages, genders, sexualities, or any other variable, can suffer.”
PTSD was first recognised in first world war soldiers, though often as a mysterious, poorly managed condition referred to as “shell shock”. Many were discharged from the military in severe psychiatric distress. It was only in 1980, after the traumas of the Vietnam war, that the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) in the US recognised PTSD as a diagnosable entity, defined by highly distressing symptoms such as intrusive memories, flashbacks, nightmares, persistent fear and dread, anger, guilt, shame, sleeplessness and many physical manifestations of anxiety such as increased heart rate, sweating, dizziness, nausea and diarrhoea.
The National Institute of Mental Health, part of the US Department of Health and Human Services, states that the trauma that causes the distress is actually not always “dangerous”. For example, some people develop PTSD after someone close experiences harm, or after the death of a loved one. Women sometimes experience it after childbirth. And, in fact, women are more likely to develop PTSD than men. Why? The high incidence of sexual violence.
The World Health Organisation states that the prevalence of sexual violence faced by women and the correspondingly high rate of PTSD renders women the largest single group of people affected by this disorder. In England and Wales one in five women aged 16-59 have experienced some form of sexual violence since the age of 16; and 31% of women aged 18-24 report having experienced sexual abuse in childhood. It is suspected that these figures might be an under-representation due to a lack of reporting fed by our culture of disbelief – a culture Morgan illustrated and fed with his tweets. By extension, many women may not be seeking help for symptoms of PTSD.
The military takes sexual assault very seriously. The US Department of Veteran Affairs says that sexual assault is “more likely to cause PTSD than many other events”. Of course, within the military this is not just a women’s issue. In the US one in four women and one in 100 men who were screened reported experiencing military sexual trauma. Rates are higher among women, but because there are more men than women in the military, though there are significant numbers of victims of both genders.
The intersection of sexual assault and PTSD cannot be refuted by anyone. Striking gender differences are found in the patterns of mental health problems across the world, including, as we know, in the prevalence of PTSD, but no one benefits if sexual trauma is somehow banished from our perceived parameters of “proper” PTSD. It is thought that 12,000 men are raped in England and Wales every year. Painting PTSD as something only military veterans live with is a callous dismissal of the pain many of these men, and by extension their families, are likely to be living with.
We frequently see on social media how celebrity provides a prompt for conversations about sexual assault. Last month the former darts champion Eric Bristow lost his role as a pundit for Sky Sports after firing off a series of offensive tweets on the football child abuse scandal, and while many vilified him, his comments nonetheless amplified the shame and stigma that have so often prevented victims from speaking out.
In the wake of Morgan’s comments about Lady Gaga, it’s easy to feel impotent. What we can do, when we encounter these subjects, is to be committed to challenging both our own and others’ ideas of what mental distress or trauma looks like. Being ill-informed might be provocative, but it is certainly not productive.
The Christmas decorations sum things up. There are things I have brought back from Britain, Vincenzo from Sicily, and then bits from Rome – some sacred, one rude. A few are old and significant, but most twinkling and cheap, and one – my favourite – a huge pom-pom, I found. Most years a new decoration is added, and at least one lost or broken. This collection is put up differently every year: on a tree, on shelves, or dangled from the inherited candelabra-style light fitting (in which case they may stay up for the rest of the year, the pom-pom bonking tall people on the head).
Our Christmas food and traditions are much the same as the decorations: lots of things, from three places, that we arrange differently each year, hopefully without getting too precious. In the past I have made a traditional English Christmas lunch in Rome: faithful recipes, mostly from Jane Grigson’s English Food, adding fresh bread sauce smudges to page 237 annually. But these English meals have always had Roman and Sicilian trimmings, and vice-versa.
Last Friday morning, as a neighbour hammered a Babbo Natale (Father Christmas) figure to her front door as if he had offended her, Vincenzo’s parents dropped by to talk about this year’s arrangements. I’d planned to open the last jar of 2014 mincemeat – now so seasoned it is boozy – and make mince pies. Instead we worked through a bottle of prosecco and a family-sized bag of crisps while we made plans.
This year for Vigilia – Christmas Eve – as is traditional in Sicily, we will have baccalà (salt cod), but also Roman-style fritti – artichokes and anchovies. Then on Christmas Day, after mushroom paté on hot buttered toast, we’ll have another Sicilian family tradition: a big baked pasta. In essence, this pasta will be rather like Cinzia’s recipe published earlier this year, only enriched for a celebration with more sauce, tiny meatballs, peas and hard-boiled eggs, their yolks glowing richly.
There will be Christmas cake and its Roman counterpart pangiallo (yellow bread), a dense mass of dried and candied fruit, nuts and spices, painted with saffron glaze and baked. It looks odd, but is delicious – an ode to dried, wrinkly fruit, and excellent with sharp cheese.
At some point in the holidays I am going to put on Radio 6, pour myself a large sherry (cheers Grandma Roddy) and make my friend Carla’s pumpkin ravioli, a pasta case around a soft, blazing pillow of roasted pumpkin, ricotta, parmesan and crushed amaretti – so it is both savoury and sweet – served in a pool of sage butter.
We are also going to make porchetta: a piece of pork belly seasoned vigorously with salt, rosemary and fennel seeds, then rolled, tied and roasted until the meat, protected by swirls of fat, is incredibly tender and the skin ruptured into crackling that could cut your lip. Porchetta isn’t traditional in Italy at Christmas, but it’s straightforward to make, celebratory and generous, either feeding a crowd or lasting for days. Braised lentils are a happy sidekick, mellow and earthy. Lentils are traditionally eaten on New Year’s Eve in Italy, their shape reminiscent of coins, the idea being the more you eat, the more prosperous a year you’ll have. Sicilian-style spinach (with raisins and pine nuts), and Roman sweet and sour onions, like shiny baubles, make good companions.
Like decorations, the recipes included here are hung all over Christmas, but you could string them together into a single feast – in which case I would like an invite.
Of course, in all these plans something will get lost or broken. As a wise friend of my father’s used to say: “Keep expectations flexible.” It is sound advice – especially in times of joy and sorrow. I say: you can always buy the cake. However you hang your decorations and whatever you eat, I hope your Christmas is as happy as can be.
Once made, this paté will keep for several days in the fridge.
125ml white wine
Salt and black pepper
2 tbsp parsley
A pinch of dried thyme
A grating of nutmeg
Bread, to serve
1 Melt the butter and fry the onions and garlic until soft. Add the mushrooms, stir, add the wine, season, and cook until very soft. Drain the liquor from the mushrooms, reserving the mushrooms and onions, into another pan, and then reduce this liquid to a thick syrupy texture.
2 Pass the mushrooms through a food mill or chop finely, then add back to the thick liquor. Add the herbs and nutmeg. The consistency should be firm. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Serve on top of crostini, slices of baguette or toast.
You will need a pasta rolling machine. The secret is rolling the pasta as thin as you can, and then easing the air from each pillow as you would air from a hot water bottle.
Serves 4
For the filling
1kg pumpkin or butternut squash, peeled and sliced
300g ricotta
80g parmesan
4 amaretti biscuits
Salt and black pepper
A grating of nutmeg
1 Make the filling by roasting the pumpkin or squash until soft and ever so slightly caramelised. Mash with the ricotta, parmesan, crushed amaretti, salt, pepper and nutmeg
2 On a clean work surface, make a mountain of the flour, then swirl your fist in the centre to make a wide crater. Break the eggs into the crater, use a fork to whisk them and then start mixing the flour into the egg. Once half the flour is mixed in, use your hands to bring everything into a rough ball. Knead the dough using the ball of your hand, rotating as you go until the dough is smooth and soft as a baby’s bum – about 8 minutes but maybe more. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes under a bowl.
3 Cut the dough into 4 pieces. Set the pasta machine to the widest setting, pat one quarter into a flat patty and pass through the machine, twice, then lay on a floured board, rubbing the sheet with flour. Do the same with the other three quarters. Reduce the setting by one, and pass all four sheets through again. Repeat until you have passed all four sheets through all settings – for ravioli you want the thinnest dough. You want sheets 10cm wide and a manageable length so cut them if necessary.
4 On a work surface dusted lightly with flour, lay out the pasta sheets. Using a teaspoon, put acorn-sized mounds of the filling mixture at 3½cm intervals until you have covered half of each strip of pasta. Fold the other half of the pasta sheet over to cover the heaps of filling and then firmly press your fingertips between and around the mounds to seal them. Cut the ravioli apart with a wheeled cutter, then put them on a clean tea towel or flour-dusted tray, making sure they don’t touch each other or they will stick.
5 To cook the ravioli, bring a large pan of water to the boil, add the salt, stir and then carefully drop the ravioli into the pan a few at a time. Depending on the thickness, ravioli takes anything from 4–6 minutes. Test for doneness by eye, pinching the edge of the pasta and tasting. Don’t leave it unattended.
6 While the pasta is cooking, melt the butter in a small saucepan or frying pan over a low heat. Increase the heat and add the sage leaves and allow to sizzle gently. Pour over the ravioli.
Make sure you rest the meat according to the instructions – rest is key here.
Serves 6 generously, with leftovers for sandwiches
1 x 3kg porchetta joint – a rectangular piece of pork belly (with skin)
Salt
1 tsp black peppercorns, crushed
1 tsp peperoncino (dried chilli flakes)
2 tbsp rosemary, chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 tbsp ground fennel seeds, or fennel pollen if you can find it
1 Put the pork skin-side down on a clean work surface, season it generously with salt, then massage the salt into the flesh with your fingertips. Sprinkle over the black pepper, chilli flakes, rosemary, garlic and fennel and massage again. Roll the pork up as neatly and tightly as possible. Tie it at 2cm intervals with kitchen twine. Prick it all over with a larding needle or the tip of a very sharp knife. Cover the pork first with greaseproof paper, then with foil, and leave it to rest for at least 12 hours in the fridge.
2 Remove it from the fridge at least 1 hour before roasting and preheat the oven to 160C/325F/gas mark 3. Use a clean, dry cloth to pat the meat very dry, rub vigorously with a handful of coarse salt, and put it on a rack over a large baking tray. Slide the pork into the middle of the oven and roast for 4½ hours. For the last half an hour, crank the oven up to maximum to crisp the skin, so that it almost ruptures into deep golden crackling. The meat inside will be soft and succulent. Leave the meat to rest, uncovered, for at least an hour before eating.
Serves 6
500g small brown Italian lentils
2 bay leaves
An onion, peeled and finely diced
A carrot, peeled and finely diced
A stick of celery, peeled and finely diced
6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to finish
Salt and black pepper
A handful of parsley, finely chopped
1 Rinse the lentils and check for stones. Bring a pan of salted water to the boil, add the lentils and bay leaves and cook until the lentils are tender, but not mushy. Drain.
2 In a large, deep frying pan over a medium-low heat, fry the diced vegetables in the olive oil, with a pinch of salt, until very tender.
3 Add the lentils, season boldly, and stir. Leave to rest for at least 30 minutes. Just before serving, reheat gently and add the parsley and another couple of tablespoons of olive oil for shine.
You only want the leaves to wilt initially, and lose some water. In the second pan, stir until each leaf glistens.
Serves 4–6, as a side
30g raisins or sultanas
500g spinach leaves (not baby spinach)
2 garlic cloves
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
20g butter
30g pine nuts
1 Soak the raisins in warm water for 10 minutes. Rinse the spinach well, discard any wilted or bruised leaves and trim away any thick, woody stalks. Put the spinach in a large pan with nothing but the water that clings to the leaves, cover the pan and cook over a low heat until the spinach has collapsed. This should take about 3-5 minutes, depending on the freshness and age of the spinach.
2 Drain the spinach in a colander and press gently to get rid of excess water. Peel and crush the garlic cloves with the back of a knife. In a large frying or sauté pan, cook the garlic gently in the olive oil over a medium-low heat until it is fragrant, then remove and discard it.
3 Add the butter, let it foam slightly, then add the pine nuts and turn them in the oil before adding the spinach and a pinch of salt. Cook for 2 minutes, or until the leaves glisten. Drain the raisins and add them to the pan, turn the ingredients a couple more times and serve.
Sticky and delicious, these onions also make an excellent antipasti.
Serves 4–6, as a condiment
600g very small onions or shallots
1 garlic clove
3 tbsp olive oil
Salt, to taste
2 heaped tbsp sugar
Red wine vinegar
1 Peel the onions. Chop two of them very finely along with the garlic and cook them gently in the olive oil in a heavy-based frying pan.
2 Once the onion and garlic are soft, golden and translucent, add the rest of the whole onions, stirring so that they are all well-coated with oil. Sprinkle with salt and sugar, then almost cover them with a mixture of half water and half vinegar – the amount will depend on the size of your pan.
3 Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Half-cover the pan and leave it to bubble gently for about 1½-2 hours, turning the onions every now and then. They’re ready when all the liquid has evaporated and they are very soft, sitting in dark, shiny, sticky sauce.
Elizabeth David’s introduction to these oranges in Italian Food is as delightful to read as they are to eat.
1 Using a vegetable peeler, carefully pare away the zest from 2 oranges, taking as little pith as possible. Cut this zest into matchstick-sized lengths and cover it with cold water in a small pan. Bring to the boil and cook for 7 minutes to remove the bitterness, then drain.
2 Now, working with a sharp knife, pare off the white pith from the zested oranges, and remove the peel and pith from the other ones. Set the oranges aside.
3 Make a syrup by dissolving the sugar in about 250ml water over a low heat, then increasing the heat and boiling until it reduces and forms a syrup that coats the back of a spoon. Roll the oranges in the syrup, then let them sit for about 5 minutes, turning and rolling from time to time so they soak up as much as possible. Arrange the syrup-soaked oranges on a serving plate.
4 Put the blanched zest matchsticks in the syrup over a medium heat, bring to the boil and cook until they are translucent and just beginning to caramelise. Arrange a little pile of zest on top of each orange, pour the syrup over each one, then chill before serving.
Use wet hands to shape the pangiallo, moulding and pressing it into a flattened ball. Pangiallo gets better with time, so, if you can, make it at least a few days in advance.
Makes 2 small cakes, or 16-20 slices
100g sultanas
100g dried figs
150g candied fruit or peel
200g mixed nuts, such as almonds, pine nuts, hazelnuts and walnuts
100g plain flour
½ whole nutmeg, grated
A pinch of cinnamon
½ tsp black pepper
150g honey
80g icing sugar
For the glaze
A few threads of saffron
2 tbsp warm water
2 egg yolks
1 tbsp flour
1 tbsp icing sugar
1 Soak the sultanas in a little hot water for 10 minutes. Chop the figs into eighths and dice the candied fruit if it is in large pieces. Once the sultanas are plump, squeeze out any excess water.
2 In a large bowl, mix together the dried fruit and chopped nuts, then add the flour, nutmeg, cinnamon and pepper and stir again or toss with your hands so that each piece of fruit or nut is well coated.
3 Preheat the oven to 170C/335F/gas mark 3½ and line a baking tray with baking parchment. In a small pan over a medium heat, warm the honey with 1 tablespoon water, add the icing sugar and stir until it bubbles at the edges. Pour the honey mixture over the fruit and nut mixture, then use a spoon to mix the ingredients until you have a lumpy and sticky but consistent mass. Divide the mass in half, then shape it into 2 round loaves about 3cm deep and 15cm wide. Sit them on the prepared baking tray.
4 Make the glaze by dissolving the saffron in the warm water, then add the yolks, flour and icing sugar. Beat well until they form a yellow paste, then brush over the tops of the loaves.
5 Bake for 30 minutes, or until they are firm and golden at the edges, and the glaze is bright yellow.

Of course it makes sense that Alessandro Michele would have a wild-animal fetish: the Gucci demigod’s aesthetic persona is equal parts cowardly lion, Victorian dandy and Kings of Leon four albums ago.
The spring/summer campaign shot by Glen Luchford is no Kenzo-lite; instead, it’s a beautiful diorama of hipsters with added wild beasts. The moodboard here is very “Mowgli from The Jungle Book moved to Brooklyn and brought his furry friends with him”.
Stylewatch did a bit of a double-take, we have to admit, when we realised that the sleek tiger and giraffe prints existed on actual tigers and giraffes. The clothes are peak-Michele, with a soupçon of 80s about them: sweatshirts in Molly Ringwald pink, T-shirts emblazoned with retro logos and Freddy Krueger-cut suit jackets. And if there is a sense of the familiar about it – Gucci, like Westworld, is stuck in a narrative loop – we want to go there.
Q I have a genuine problem which is causing a problem in my marriage. I married my wife over 20 years ago. When we met, she already had three children by a previous marriage, and we had one more together.
I have always treated them all the same, and my current will leaves everything to my wife, or in the event of her death, a straight four-way split between the kids. I have no intention, or plan, to revise this, my wife’s will is a mirror-image.
Over the last few years my wife has become concerned that if she pre-deceases me, I may subsequently remarry ‘some old scrubber’ and if I subsequently die, the joint estate would pass into the hands of such a woman, to the detriment of our children.
We have had several ‘rows’ about it, and divorce is now being mentioned in order to prevent me leaving the kids’ inheritance to this non-existent woman.
As I really don’t want to have to get divorced in order to prevent me doing something that I actually have no intention of doing I was wondering is there any sort of legal device whereby my wife can change her will to prevent her hard-earned money going to some ‘gold-digging slut’, that would not involve me being left homeless after her death? I am hoping you may be able to suggest something.
AN
A Your wife has reason to be concerned. But not because you are likely to fall for and marry someone unsuitable after her death. The possible cause for concern would be that if you did remarry, the remarriage would automatically revoke your current will. This would mean that if you died after remarrying without making a new will – or without making a new will ‘in anticipation of’ your next marriage (ie before you did the deed) – what your child and step-children would get would be decided by the rules of intestacy rather than by you.
Since the new rules introduced in England & Wales in October 2014, if you die leaving a wife, husband, civil partner and a child or children, the married or civil partner gets the lot if your estate is worth £250,000 or less. If your estate is worth more than that, the surviving wife, husband or civil partner gets £250,000, all personal possessions plus half the remaining estate, while any children (including adopted children) get whatever is leftover split between them. Another thing that may worry both you and your wife is that the term ‘children’ under the rules, does not include step-children unless legally adopted. (The rules are different in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and you can find out exactly who would get what if you live in England or Wales)
You may be relieved to hear that divorce isn’t the answer either because the same scenario as above would apply if you remarried after divorce rather than death and failed to make a new will in your children’s favour.
But you are right in thinking that your wife could guard against your children missing out on what you would like them to inherit by making a new will. For example, she could leave her half of the house plus whatever else to your children while giving you the right to live in the property until your death. You could do the same with your will. Whatever you do, it should be to seek expert legal advice as this is a complicated area – especially where step-children are involved.
 ‘I think of all these women like the Wizard of Oz,’ Carroll says. ‘This feared being behind the green curtain who’s pulling all the strings and making all the noise, when in fact it’s just this lonely little guy who’s made up this whole thing. But at the same time, behind the curtain, he has all this power and he still is making all this stuff happen. And a lot of women actually have a huge amount of power by controlling their homes’
A new campaign that aims to counter images of an “all white” Christmas is to be launched on Thursday to increase the number of black and ethnic minority families portrayed enjoying the festive period.
A series of images of black and ethnic minority families doing things such as wrapping Christmas presents or decorating a tree will be made available on social media platforms under the hashtag #ChristmasSoWhite in a bid to increase the diversity of holiday images.
Nadya Powell, an advertising consultant, was inspired to start the project when looking for images for a school website project on favourite things at Christmas. She was searching for snowball fights to reflect the choice of her six-year-old daughter’s friend, Sara. “I looked at white family upon white family and then looked at Sara, who is black,” said Powell. “I asked her to choose a picture, and she chose the backs of the family’s heads.
“She was not seeing anything that looked like her and I realised she never did. This beautiful little girl is growing up in a world where on a daily basis she doesn’t see people like her in any media, where a perfect Christmas is a white Christmas.”
Powell believes that Christmas has somehow become linked with the idea of white people and snow. Online searches for families wrapping presents or throwing snowballs produce results that are almost entirely white models.
Powell teamed up with Looks Like Me, a modelling agency that was started because the founder’s daughter wanted to be white “like all the girls in the magazines”, to add balance to the overwhelmingly whiteness of most Christmas images.
The group is also talking to photography distribution platforms about access to the images. Shot by the photographer Helen Marsden, the images of families will also be available on the website www.christmassowhite.com from Thursday.
The campaign has been financed so far by eight large media and marketing groups including Google, MediaCom, Saatchi & Saatchi and Edelman. In an email Karen Blackett, chairwoman of MediaCom, said: “This campaign is long overdue and is so needed.”

Letter: Far from the circuits of local bands and musicians dying out in the late 20th century, this Christmas tradition thrives in Dorset
It’s Christmas time, and there’s plenty of reasons to be afraid if you’re a retail worker, according to a musical protest by Labour MPs.
MPs including Dan Jarvis, Angela Rayner and Mary Creagh have recorded a Christmas single to the tune of the 1980s Band Aid hit Do They Know It’s Christmas, accusing companies of cutting workers’ perks after the introduction of the “national living wage”.
Mitcham and Morden MP Siobhain McDonagh, who directed the chorus, said she wanted find a catchy way of drawing attention to the issue, which she said had seen firms cut overtime pay rates, free lunches and bonuses after the introduction of the national living wage which requires employers to pay staff over 25 at least £7.20 an hour.
“We know that they have plenty/ But still they give us less and less/ Stand up against the greed this Christmas time,” the MPs sing. The chorus of “Feed the World” is now “Keep the perks, don’t be Scrooge this Christmas time.”
The song is a trademark of the Band Aid Trust, which will receive all the profits from the single.
Several political songs are aiming to reach the charts this Christmas, with the chancellor Philip Hammond agreeing to waive VAT on sales of a Christmas single in memory of late Labour MP Jo Cox.
The special recording of the Rolling Stones’ hit You Can’t Always Get What You Want features cross-party MPs and musicians including Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson, Cockney Rebel’s Steve Harley, KT Tunstall and David Gray. Money raised from the single will go to the Jo Cox Foundation which supports a range of charities, including the Royal Voluntary Service and the White Helmets.
A Jeremy Corbyn-themed Christmas song called JC4PM has also been recorded by Robb Johnson and the Corbynistas, with has a video featuring actor Maxine Peake.
Martin Johnes, the author of Christmas and the British: A Modern History, and John Mullan, who reviewed it (10 December), need to do their homework: far from the circuits of local bands and musicians dying out in the late 20th century, this tradition thrives in Dorset.
I sang carols in Hardy’s birthplace last Christmas, took part in Going the Rounds through Bockhampton and Stinsford only last year, and regularly sing out with the Ridgeway Singers and Band. Thanks to the tireless energies of Furse Swann, Tim Laycock and Phil Humphries, the Hardy Society, New Hardy Players and the Artsreach rural touring organisation, traditional entertainment is alive, kicking and magical here at this time of year, and well supported by the public.

Boohoo, an online fashion retailer, has taken control of PrettyLittleThing, the fast-growing website set up by the children of Boohoo’s co-founder Mahmud Kamani. “This is a very good deal for shareholders,” said Boohoo’s chairman, Peter Williams, before adding that it was a “natural fit” for the company.
PrettyLittleThing (PLT), aimed at 16-24-year-olds, was founded by Kamani’s sons, Umar, Adam and Samir, in 2012. Boohoo is paying £3.3m for the 66% owned by Adam and Samir, while Umar and other senior managers will continue to speak for 34% as part of a five-year performance-related deal agreed with the board.
To avoid accusations of a conflict of interest when Boohoo listed on the junior market in 2014, the prospectus included the option to acquire PLT for £5m within three years.
Last year PLT sales jumped 400% to £17m in the 12 months to end of February 2016. Like Boohoo, PLT is based in Manchester with its headquarters housed in a former mill in Ancoats that was once operated as a knitting factory by Umar’s uncle.
Williams said Mahmud Kamani, Boohoo’s joint chief executive, was not involved in the PLT negotiations. “We went through an independent process to arrive at this deal,” he said. The outcome, he added, struck a balance between exercising the option to buy PLT and retaining the talents of the executives who were running it so successfully.
The deal was announced as Boohoo upgraded its sales and profit forecasts for the current financial year, sending its shares up more than 12%. It expects sales to rise by between 38% and 42%, an improvement on its previous guidance of 30-35%.
PLT describes itself as offering “killer affordable style to female fashion breakers and makers”.
The Femicide Census report launched earlier this month provides important insights into the epidemic of women killed by men in England and Wales, but it was disappointing to see Karen Ingala Smith of Nia using this to further an agenda about the criminalisation of sex buyers (Why does a woman stay with a violent man? Sometimes, to save her life, theguardian.com, 7 December).
Violence against women is one of the factors at play when female sex workers are killed. But large amounts of evidence from around the world have shown that another major factor is the criminalisation of those involved in the sex industry. Ingala Smith isolated the death of Daria Pionko here in Leeds as a reason why the purchase of sex should be criminalised. Pionko was murdered since the development of a new approach to street sex work – women can work in a designated area of the city without being prosecuted for soliciting. What Ingala Smith didn’t mention was that four sex workers have been killed in Leeds since 1990, three under a policy of criminalisation of sex workers and buyers. Pionko was a migrant sex worker. Of 18 UK sex workers murdered since 2013, more than half have been migrant women, indicating a targeting of vulnerability exacerbated by criminalisation and stigmatisation.
Under the new approach we have seen a 10-fold increase in crimes against sex workers reported to police, and have secured convictions for violent crimes never achieved before. The Femicide Census is all about understanding the killings of women in context. It was a shame to see the context of sex worker murders stripped away to argue for the criminalisation of sex buyers, a policy that has such a weak evidence base.

“We continue to push VW to take action to compensate the UK consumer,” says the Department for Transport (Report, 12 December). But why is it that comment on the “dieselgate” scandal focuses on compensation to owners? It is city residents in general that suffer the health impacts, and it is the NHS that bears the costs of caring for them. VW should make payments that reflect these costs, and city leaders (including London’s mayor) should be holding Chris Grayling to account for achieving this.

• “Whatever happened to convalescent homes?” asks Mary Conn (Letters, 7 December). First we need to ask “Whatever happened to the concept of ‘convalescence’?” I haven’t heard this word used in decades. Perhaps there’s been the odd PhD about its demise; if not there ought to be. Its bizarre disappearance coincides to some extent with the ever-increasing brutality (and short-term stupidity) of government policies and practices that oblige people to function fully before they are recovered (whether being prematurely discharged home before they are ready, and/or prematurely forced back to work).

Not even notice because you've got the whole house lit by candles already ​
Spend hours getting wound up on the phone trying to get an electrician
I was given the book A Day at elBulli a couple of Christmases ago and have opened it exactly once. I found that David Thompson’s Thai food cookbook made a good tray for a TV dinner. I have sent dozens of encyclopedic, clever, well-researched cookbooks to the charity shop. When it comes to cookbooks, my tastes are … unconventional. I love books with overstyled glossy photos, gratuitous cleavage shots and chatty rambling prose. I love recipes interspersed with lengthy personal digressions and flavoured with a good splash of healthy narcissism. I love celebrity cookbooks.
Celebrity cookbooks are strange. To a degree, they’re just an extension of a person’s brand: they come right after the syrupy perfume and the clothing line for Peacocks. Attach a big name (anyone from Fearne Cotton upwards will do), throw in a behind-the-scenes “recipe developer” or two and fill the pages with cheery snaps of the personality with their food and you’re on to a cookbook winner that will defy the general downturn in sales of print books. The inevitability of it all is as comforting as ITV2 showing The Mummy again, or your weekly Tuesday-night spag bol. But there’s something incongruous about the dizzying heights of celebrity and the messy, ugly reality of cooking and eating, and all the humanity that entails. Celebrities know all about this strangeness. They know how their fame sits uncomfortably against a backdrop of domesticity, home cooking and family. So, every celebrity cookbook is a reminder that these big names eat, sleep and shit like the rest of us. It’s just that they look great while they do it, and they’ll be damned if they’re going to let you forget that. I can’t get enough of them.
My first celebrity cookbook was Kris Jenner’s In the Kitchen with Kris. I bought it in a fugue state after a marathon four-hour Keeping Up with the Kardashians session, dizzy on the wholesome visions of family that I had just mainlined. The Kardashian-Jenner tribe may be all about the drama, but it’s steady, familial love that underpins the whole operation, and that family unit finds its heart in the Kardashian kitchen. The cookbook draws inspiration from that homeliness. There’s a recipe for Cream of Wheat – just a box of Cream of Wheat, sugar to serve and some milk – in memory of Kris’s late husband and the Kardashian sisters’ dad, Robert Kardashian. (It was the only food he could stomach in the late stages of his cancer.) There are Armenian recipes that celebrate the family’s heritage, and anecdotes woven through the recipes.
This is what celebrity cookbooks do so well. When Kris Jenner, or her ghostwriter, opens a lemon chiffon pie recipe with a story about how nostalgic it makes her for the chaos of her full house, before the kids flew the nest, it puts the food into context. And when food is put into context, it becomes far more interesting than any Michelin-starred meal ever could. In model and presenter Chrissy Teigen’s book Cravings, the recipes are seasoned with Teigen’s trademark irreverence. There she is, the Sports Illustrated cover star, in a swimsuit with a fried chicken wing; here I am, in my pants with a Tesco sandwich. We have a connection, I think, as I pick prawn from my teeth.
These cookbooks aren’t perfect, of course, and the recipes can be uninspired, tricky, even downright bad. There’s a walnut loaf recipe in Stanley Tucci’s The Tucci Cookbook that I had to play around with a few times before I got a dough that worked; Kelis has a recipe for Japanese sweet potato samosas in her debut cookbook, My Life on a Plate, which – to the best of my knowledge – are neither Japanese nor samosas. These books are no different to any po-faced “real” cookbook in this respect, though: take the infamous River Cafe chocolate cake, or the notorious naffness of cheffy cookbooks, haphazardly transcribed for home use from the chaos of the restaurant kitchen. Make any recipe to which Delia hasn’t given her no-nonsense stamp of approval, and you run the risk of cooking up a disaster. But that’s all part of the fun.
In research carried out last year, it emerged that almost half of women over 55 no longer use cookbooks, preferring instead to turn to the internet. Consider, too, the outcry earlier this year when the BBC threatened to close its recipe site. Online recipes are more popular than ever and, in the face of this, print cookbooks need to be able to offer something more. Anyone can find instructions for a passable lasagne with just a Google search and a click or two. When we buy cookbooks, we want something personal, rich and exciting; something that tells a story about food and people, rather than just a manual. Something like the Ziggy Marley and Family cookbook, or Freddie Prinze Jr’s Back to the Kitchen. Give me them over the Noma cookbook any day.
This is the only time of year when it is acceptable to wear something sparky and glittery to work. Or the pub. Or dinner. Or a walk. Here is our pick of the best pieces to buy now
The UK’s first pop-up village in south-east London, which houses 24 formerly homeless families, is a novel attempt at helping tackle Britain’s housing crisis and will serve as a blueprint for factory-made accommodation across the capital and in other cities.
The 96 residents of the brightly coloured Ladywell development in Lewisham previously lived in B&Bs or private rented accommodation and started moving in from August after it was built in eight months.
Mariatu Turay moved from a noisy flat above a 99p store on the main shopping street in Catford with her two daughters. She said her new home was far nicer and quieter than where she lived before.
The Ladywell flat costs Turay £1,061 a month. She is able to pay the rent since becoming a health science student at the University of East London.
Ceyda Eray previously lived in a damp house in Brockley with her two daughters, then aged nine and 14. “I went to the doctor and he gave them asthma pumps because my oldest one, when she was doing PE, after five to 10 minutes she was breathless, and my youngest one had eczema,” she said.
“But after we left that place she was fine and now she doesn’t have anything. No asthma pumps, no eczema creams, nothing.
“My husband says: ‘I hope these flats stay and we’ll be there permanently.’”
The two-bedroom homes are temporary and will stay in Ladywell for up to five years while Lewisham council finalises its long-term plans for the area. They were designed by Richard Rogers’ architectural practice, Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners (RSHP), which worked in partnership with the council, the construction company AECOM and insulation company SIG.
When the residents moved in, rents were generally paid through housing benefit, but most now pay at least part of the rent. Lewisham council expects to find them permanent accommodation within 18 to 24 months and stresses that no one is going to be homeless when the project ends.
RSHP believes its concept for high-quality accommodation, made in factories and designed to last for 60 years, could help achieve the government’s target of building 100,000 modular homes out of a planned 1m homes over the course of this parliament.
Each flat in the £5m Ladywell development consists of two units made in a Derbyshire factory, put on lorries and lifted into place by cranes. They can be taken apart and rebuilt elsewhere up to five times.
Lewisham council said each home cost £156,000 to build, about 20% cheaper than a typical council home.
The flats are bright, spacious – 77 sq metres (829 sq ft), above the London space standard of 75 sq m – and well insulated, costing about £500 a year in utility bills. There are shops, a cafe, a community cinema and co-working spaces for small local businesses on the ground floor.
Another resident, Christelle Kapeu, said: “When we came in, my second son actually didn’t want to sleep at all – he was so excited about the place and the balcony. You usually have houses with balconies, but it’s huge.
“When you are outside, you can’t even imagine what is inside. You think, oh, this must be a small place, but when you come in, oh my God. I put all my stuff in and there is still some space left. It’s so spacious.”
Roger Harding, the director of policy at the homelessness charity Shelter, said: “This scheme is a great way of helping homeless families get back on their feet and it’s really positive to see Lewisham borough council looking for new ways to tackle the housing crisis.
“We would encourage other councils to look at this model as a cost-effective way of keeping homeless families in good-quality homes in their local borough, close to friends, family, schools and jobs.
“Ultimately, what’s most important to avoid families needing this sort of urgent support in the first place is to make sure we are building homes that are genuinely affordable to buy and rent for the long term.”
Councils across the country are struggling to get people off their housing lists and into permanent accommodation, faced with rapidly rising property prices and rents, and the loss of social housing through the right-to-buy scheme.
Lewisham council has 9,422 households on its waiting list for homes, 526 of them in nightly paid temporary accommodation, such as B&Bs.
The council is drawing up plans with RSHP for more modular housing in the borough, which will be permanent, and another project is at the design stage.
The Ladywell scheme has attracted a lot of interest and the company hopes to build similar housing, either temporary or permanent, elsewhere in London and in other cities including Manchester.
Mistletoe brings green life to the bare trees of winter and is a symbol of fertility and renewal in the darkest days of the year.
Mistletoe gains part of the nutrition it needs through stealing nutrients and water from its host plant. In the case of the european Mistletoe (Viscum album), apple, hawthorn and poplar trees are the preferred hosts, but it is known to grow on many other species too. It gains the nutrients and water it needs by both photosynthesising and by sending specialised roots called haustoria deep into its host tree’s vascular tissue.
In the garden mistletoe is not the easiest plant to establish, but if you follow certain rules you may be able to get some going on an apple tree or hawthorn.
With more than 4000 known parasitic species of plants, mistletoe is certainly not the only parasite worth trying in your garden, and some are easier to grow. In particular, there is an amazing family of plants called the Orobanchaceae that contains more than 90 different genera (only three of which are not parasitic). Some of them make excellent garden plants if you can provide the right conditions and hosts to allow them to establish themselves.
Yellow rattles (Rhinanthus sp.), eyebrights (Euphrasia sp.) and Indian paintbrushes (Castilleja sp.) are all hemiparasitic (like mistletoe), but they attach themselves to the roots of grasses, not trees They are important in helping to create those longed-for wildflower rich meadow landscapes that have become so popular in gardens. By weakening the grasses on which they live, they allow other flowering plants a chance among the sward, while adding their brightly coloured flowers to the overall tapestry of the meadow. Louseworts (Pedicularis sp) are also worth trying to find, although only a few have ever been offered by UK nurseries. With well over 300 species to choose from, they are an incredible and rewarding genus to try to grow. I first encountered Pedicularis sylvatica as a child on the upland moors of Wales and it has remained one of my favourite UK native species ever since.
A seemingly much more sinister group of plants, the holoparasites, get all their nutrition from their host plant, producing no chlorophyll themselves. Sometimes they can even live out their entire life inside their host, only showing themselves when they flower.
Purple toothwort (Lathraea clandestina), also in the Orobanchaceae, prefers to attach itself to the roots of willow and alder but will grow happily on a range of hosts. It can take 10 years to flower if grown from seed but can also be introduced to a garden by being transplanted if you are quick about it. To see a mat of this plant in full flower at the base of a tree is quite a sight to behold.
But true broomrapes (Orobanche and Cystanche sp) are in my opinion the most seductive of these vampires of the plant world. Looking like tatty orchids, they come in the most unusual range of colours from bright yellow through to muted burned tones and the most crystal clear of whites. As they lack leaves, they seem to stand out in a way that few other plants do in a garden. Some, like the ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae), are little trouble to grow, but be careful with others, as some species can be problematic for agricultural crops and while not killing their host (as this would kill themselves) they can cause severe reduction in crop productivity.
It is with this warning that I leave you to mull growing some of these most unusual of plants, whose lives are so attached to the lives of others, and to think about the mistletoe above your heads and the incredible feat of evolution that allows some plants this strange strategy for survival.
Christmas is a time of tradition for many families, but the word “tradition” can sometimes feel synonymous with routine and repetition, like a month spent listening to the chorus of Paul McCartney’s Wonderful Christmastime. This is true of movies, too. There are holiday standards old and new, from It’s a Wonderful Life to Home Alone to Love Actually, and harder-edged alternatives for when the kids are in bed, such as Die Hard or Bad Santa. But returning to the same standards year after year leaves a lot of gems sitting in the snow, especially for more adventurous viewers who might be on the lookout for lesser-known Christmas fare, not all of the feel-good variety. For them, here are 10 titles ranging from extreme horror to Hollywood flops to high art to blink-or-you’ll-miss-it indie fare from the US and abroad.
Forget the 2006 remake, one of the most shameful attempts to revive a past horror classic. Bob Clark’s original is the pinnacle of Canadian horror, a proto-slasher movie about a serial murderer making his way through a sorority house on Christmas Eve. Black Christmas originated the first-person killer-cam that was popularized by Halloween four years later, but it’s equally memorable for its sophistication and psychological depth. Among its many virtues is an early Margot Kidder performance as a hard-drinking queen bee who tries the vanquish the threat with boozy sarcasm.
Bad Santa was not the first movie to conceive of a malevolent mall Santa pulling off a lucrative heist – and it’s not the nastiest, either. That distinction belongs to a psychopathic Christopher Plummer in The Silent Partner, a Canadian thriller that starts with Plummer casing a bank branch in a Santa costume and continues with instances of blackmail, decapitation, and Norman Bates-style cross-dressing. It’s all in service of a gripping cat-and-mouse game between Plummer and Elliott Gould as a mild-mannered teller who anticipates the robbery and tucks away $50,000 for himself.
Touchstone Pictures released Ted Demme’s enthusiastically vulgar black comedy in the spring to keep from spiking the eggnog, but the Christmas-in-Connecticut setting wraps a shiny red bow on the acrimony. A throwback of sorts to classic screwball comedies and home invasion thrillers like The Desperate Hours, The Ref casts Denis Leary as a thief who holes up with a couple (Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis) in the middle of a bitter marital dispute. As their bickering turns the crook into a counselor, the film turns into a verbal pie fight with Leary – very much on brand as the exasperated crank – catching it from both sides.
“Only morons are nice on Christmas,” scowls Billy Bob Thornton in this noir-tinged hybrid of a heist thriller and a black comedy, which plays like a seasonal twist on the heartland morality of Fargo. Thornton and John Cusack play a crooked businessman and a lawyer, respectively, who team up to steal $2m from their mob boss (Oliver Platt) on Christmas Eve, but cannot get out of Wichita due to the ice-covered roads. Director Harold Ramis (Groundhog Day), along with ace screenwriters Richard Russo and Robert Benton, treat the holiday with a certain dark irreverence, but they also see the greed and mayhem as a needless violation of the Christmas spirit.
Christmas in LA is an auteur stamp for Shane Black, who has been setting films during the holiday season since his breakthrough script for Lethal Weapon. Jack Frost never nips the sunny-and-75 sameness of Black’s Hollywood and the backdrop suits the scuzzy ironies that pepper his work, especially Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, his directorial debut. Robert Downey Jr plays a petty thief who gets whisked into a fake acting career and an unlikely method partnership with a private investigator (Val Kilmer), but none of it would have happened if he hadn’t tried to rob a toy store on Christmas first. Or encountered a childhood crush (Michelle Monaghan) in a devastating Santa suit.
This extreme French horror movie about a predatory stranger (Béatrice Dalle) trying to snatch a soon-to-be-born child from its expectant mother (Alysson Paradis) could have been set at any time of year. But writer and co-director Alexandre Bustillo and co-director Julien Maury stage the action on Christmas Eve for practical and thematic reasons: there are fewer cops and neighbors around to help the victim, for one, but there are also the added stakes of a lonely, widowed woman clinging to the only family she has left. For her and her baby to see this and many Christmas mornings to come, they have to survive the night.
It’s Christmastime and a mother (Catherine Deneuve) needs a bone marrow transplant. The heartwarming ending writes itself, like the third-act treacle found in many holiday dramas, but Arnaud Desplechin’s A Christmas Tale is much bigger, messier, and pricklier than its premise suggests. Over 150 minutes, Desplechin gathers a sprawling family under one roof and watches as their rivalries and conflicts pop off in minor detonations, all while keeping an eye on a complex family dynamic. Yet, at bottom, A Christmas Tale is every bit as uplifting as its sentimental counterparts: Desplechin and his superb cast – including Mathieu Amalric, Anne Consigny, Melvil Poupaud, and Emmanuelle Devos – argue for the strength of contentious families. They fight because they care.
Santa has always been interested in finding out who’s naughty and nice, but in this thoroughly bizarre fantasy-horror-action-comedy from Finland, only the naughty side draws his interest. When a team of researchers excavate a dark Christmas secret from deep within the Korvatunturi mountain range, it unleashes what could gently be referred to as Old Testament Santa. That leaves local residents to improvise a fight against this evil entity and the hordes of old, naked, wispy-bearded “elves” who serve as its faithful, head-lopping guardians.
Photographed in beautifully textured 16mm, this ultra-low-budget indie, from first-time director Charles Poekel, follows a Brooklyn Christmas tree salesman (Kentucker Audley) as he grinds out the night shift in a 24-7 corner operation. There’s drama in his world – the heartbreak of a relationship that ended after the previous season, a connection with a young woman he finds passed out on a park bench, the threat of losing money if he doesn’t sell enough trees – but Christmas, Again subtly underplays all of it, creating a lovely, perfectly proportioned slice of life.
As befits Christmas in LA, there aren’t many overt signs of yuletide cheer on the Sunset Strip in Tangerine, which follows two transgender prostitutes (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez and Mya Taylor) across the city as one of them tracks down her unfaithful boyfriend/pimp. But Sean Baker’s electrifying low-budget feature, shot entirely on iPhones, turns Christmas into a poignant marker of their disconnection from family and society at large. Some drama involving a frequent client reveals the lie of a “straight” family during Christmas dinner, but mostly, Tangerine is about a holiday lived on the margins and the tenuous refuge of friendship.

I should have known we couldn’t handle the wave. Far from the beach, my four-year-old daughter and I clung to each other in water up to my chest. Swimmers around us screamed in anticipation. I backed up and stumbled as we braced ourselves to meet the wall of water that was now a whitecap above our heads.
“Look away!” I shouted at the moment of peak pointlessness. The water shot into our nostrils, scouring sinuses with a chlorine burn. We gasped and rubbed our faces before staggering to the vinyl-clad shoreline, laughing like the fools we clearly were for having paid roughly £55 to (almost) drown in the world’s largest indoor wave pool.
World Waterpark is one of the many super-sized attractions in my local shopping centre – which happens to be the largest mall in North America, and was once the biggest in the world.
Recently, I have questioned whether time spent at West Edmonton Mall is time well spent. Only a five minute drive from my home in the Alberta capital, and with a car park that can accommodate 20,000 vehicles, I used to be embarrassed that my hometown’s reputation could depend so heavily on it. I sniffed at the culture of consumerism it represented – and what it took away from the character of the community.
My mother offers the best example of the mall’s effectiveness as an insulator. On 31 July 1987, Edmonton was hit by a tornado that killed 27 people and destroyed 300 homes. My mother, who adores West Edmonton Mall, was shopping there with her sister, who was visiting from England.
“When we came out all the streets were flooded,” she recalls. “We missed the whole thing. We had a fabulous day, but we were shocked when we came out.”
The North American enclosed mall emerged to make the onerous tasks of domestic hunting and gathering convenient and enjoyable. Since opening in 1981, Edmonton’s mall has strived to add “wondrous” to that list, landing somewhere between grand and garish.
In an era when about a third of US malls are expected to close because of failing department stores and lapsing consumer interest, West Edmonton Mall appears to thrive.
Thirty years ago, it drew roughly 20 million people a year, about twice the number who visited Disneyland, California. Today, its 800 shops draw 30 million visitors a year, and it sees almost 10 times the traffic of Banff – Alberta’s most popular Rocky Mountain park – making it the province’s top attraction. But then, wilderness isn’t our natural habitat anyway ... thanks to climate control and myriad spectacles for our shortened attention spans, maybe the mall (and West Edmonton Mall in particular) still is.
“There’s something about the formula they’ve created that warrants it’s going to be busy,” says Renee Williams, director of Edmonton Tourism. “It’s not just shopping, right?”
After more than three decades, West Edmonton Mall remains one of the defining features of my city. Despite having two toddlers who get as much fulfilment from the mall as I once did by getting as far from it as possible, this surprises me.
The biggest reason is that enclosed malls don’t align with the tenets of modern city building. They’re destinations that amass people, but not exercises, in “placemaking” – that activity city planners deem essential to creating community. As Mack Male, a prominent Edmonton blogger on local affairs, has said about such efforts in the city: “It’s not just about filling a space with people. It’s about connecting people with one another. That’s what turns space into place.”
Generally, malls struggle to make the transition in two significant ways. Firstly, shopping doesn’t promote unity; it’s a form of personal fulfilment that requires no collaboration other than with a sales clerk (or, when online, no one). By nature, the mall cuts us off from one another by encouraging the individual pursuit of stuff.
Secondly, enclosed malls cut us off from the world. Or in the case of West Edmonton Mall, it can seem to become that world (its owner, TripleFive, calls it an entertainment and retail “city”). I would even argue that it undermines placemaking efforts beyond the 48 city blocks it occupies.
When it first opened at a mere 1.1m sq ft, “the new mall was just considered another suburban shopping centre”, according to a 1987 report by the city of Edmonton in response to public concern over the mall and “its impacts”.
That naivety was remedied by – among other ill effects – an 8% economic decline in the downtown core, only now recovering thanks to a recently built National Hockey League arena. A mall actually opened downtown in 1987 in answer to West Edmonton Mall, with the hope it would pull people back to the core.
Today, revitalisation efforts tacitly focus on drawing people away from both malls, and on encouraging the proliferation of street level, independent cafes and businesses that “inject the gaiety, the wonder, the cheerful hurly-burly that make people want to come into the city and to linger there”, as Jane Jacobs once wrote. Of American cities’ new breed of self-contained civic centres, she was scathing: “They banish the street. They banish its function. They banish its variety.” That was 1958. Now we’re beckoning all of that back.
I love downtown with its growing collection of patios and the way people waste time doing little but watching each other – in summer, at least. As I write, however, the wind chill is driving the temperature to -28 C, and I can’t imagine a worse place to be than the city’s currently icy heart, especially with children.
So, there’s the mall. For many local parents (including my wife, who mall-walked the kids during two maternity leaves), West Edmonton Mall can resolve the terrifying uncertainty of what to do in Alberta’s cryogenic mid-winter. I remember my mother turning to it for salvation, bringing us in from the nearby small suburban city where I grew up. “I can’t believe that you’ll take the girls there now,” she says now. “Because you hated it.”
The fact is, West Edmonton Mall fulfils a need in the city as a vast expanse of quasi-public space. It is, at certain times of the year, an easy access biosphere in inhospitable terrain. Apart from the rare treat of a visit to the water park, the kids and I rarely spend a penny on the attractions; there’s no need.
Instead, we watch skaters glide across the Olympic-sized rink, visit forlorn-looking puppies at the pet store, eat cheap doughnuts. We merge in and out of a meandering crowd of shoppers, and participate as fully as one can in a community united only by big name brands and the bizarreness of the surroundings.
“The mall is, at heart, just another ancient organising principle that hasn’t yet outlived its usefulness,” writes Paco Underhill in Call of the Mall, the consumer-habit expert’s look at the culture of shopping.
In the effort to build better cities, West Edmonton Mall may not qualify as a maker of “place”. But is it more than just space? It’s popularity suggests it might be. “It’s not dying,” Williams says. “It’s got a good long life ahead of it.”

The British Film Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) has announced a number of changes designed to boost diversity in its membership, and thereby have a knock-on effect on its high-profile awards programme.
The most direct change is in the eligibility criteria for two of its award categories: outstanding British film; and outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer (won in 2016 by, respectively, Brooklyn, and Naji Abu Nowar and Rupert Lloyd for Theeb). Bafta has now instituted a requirement that, from 2019, films put forward must conform to the BFI’s Diversity Standards, which were established in 2014 to increase participation and representation of minorities and socially disadvantaged in British film.
In a statement, Bafta said: “[We believe] they are a flexible and achievable model, which the whole industry can adopt as a shared language for understanding diversity.” To qualify for award nomination, film-makers will have to show they have “worked to increase the representation of under-represented groups” in areas including “onscreen representation” and “industry access and opportunities”.
At the same time, Bafta is announcing changes to its membership process, in the wake of an anonymous survey in January 2016 that aimed to understand the diversity makeup of its membership. Bafta says that 45% responded, of which 41% were female, 13% minority ethnic, and the median age was 52. In the calendar year following the survey, Bafta says it has admitted 375 new members, of which 43% are female, 18% minority ethnic, and a median age of 44. The list of new members on its website includes actors Idris Elba, Emily Blunt, Sophie Okonedo and David Oyelowo, directors Andrew Haigh, Paul King and Lone Scherfig, and writers Phyllis Nagy and Jonathan Nolan.
The third change is removal of the requirement for a proposer and seconder to apply for membership from 2017. According to a statement, this has “the aim of ensuring that it’s only talent, and not also who you know, that enables Bafta membership”.

If you’ve got a physicist in your life, why not consider giving them one of the 20th century’s greatest minds? Or at least the next best thing – socks sporting Einstein’s face. These cheerful likenesses should keep feet toasty, and there surely can’t be many more inspirational ways to start the day than popping these on in the morning. Available from Chatty Feet (£7.50).
There’s a short answer and a long answer to this. The short: if you’re of a certain age (generally 40-58, average 51 in the UK) and you’ve not had a period for 12 months or more, then you’ve reached menopause, which is technically a retrospective diagnosis of your last menstrual period.
The longer? Well, “menopausal” can also encompass the build-up (or perimenopause), which can last up to four years, and the aftermath (generally another four years or so – though in extreme cases a decade or more). It’s not always easy to define where to draw the line of entry into the menopausal state. There are lists – long lists – of symptoms to look out for, but not every woman will experience every one, and they can come and go, just to add to any confusion. But take your pick from hot flushes, night sweats, thinning hair (in places where you actually want hair) and sprouting hairs (in places where you generally don’t), mood swings, moustaches, weight gain, fatigue, loss of libido, memory loss, aches and pains …
The perimenopause might almost be a dress rehearsal, a chance to experience the joys (I use the term loosely) while coming to terms with everything that menopause means in terms of womanhood, fertility and ageing. Like many, I had somewhat glibly dismissed it simply as “the bit before”, underplaying something that can truly take over your life for years on end. Nonetheless, I confess that I had given it little thought, and my in-depth scientific research (or, at least, a poll of friends on WhatsApp) suggested I was not alone.
And yet now the perimenopause is upon me, it appears that I might have been a little hasty in writing it off as something and nothing. Especially the nothing bit. True, there’s not been a doctor’s visit in years that hasn’t involved a less than subtle scrutiny, and an “ah yes, perimenopausal” verdict, though what relevance this might have to a request for a typhoid vaccine is hard to say. But it still took me completely by surprise.
Maybe because, in my head, I’m still 35 (tops). Maybe because the menopause is so much the end of an era – so farewell, then fertility, take my youthful dreams and see if I care – that it’s simpler to remain firmly in denial. Or perhaps it’s because up to this point there had been no physical signs to herald this, the surest sign of middle age.
So I found it all too easy to keep my head buried in the sand and skip along as if I had the hormones of a 20-year-old. Until the night, on holiday, that I woke up glowing like the Ready Brek kid, despite the fact that the air conditioning kept our room slightly cooler than the average fridge. Two nights of melting from the inside out, and then a break long enough to lull me into a false sense of security before it started all over again.
For many women, dealing with flushes is one of the major challenges of menopause. I knew about fans, of course, and black cohosh and the various other suggested remedies for combating the all-encompassing heat. I hadn’t heard about the magnet that you clip into your pants to keep the boiling sweats at bay. I imagined some teeny, tiny thing rather than what looks startlingly an enormous sparkly fridge magnet that you keep fastened in the front of your underwear by a (marginally) smaller sparkly fridge magnet. Long tops can be useful to hide them.
It’s still early days, so the jury is out on how effective it actually is. But a word of warning for anyone who is tempted to follow suit: don’t stand too close to a kitchen cabinet with a metal handle. (I was welded there for a moment). Or a giant stapler in the office (a friend). Another acquaintance walked around with a teaspoon stuck to her belly all day. “I’m assuming, since nobody mentioned it, they all thought it was a fashion choice.” Perhaps another reason to stick to the long tops. Oh, and it’s probably wise to steer clear of induction hobs while you’re at it.
Another thing to be wary of is a premature conclusion that your periods have actually stopped. Indeed, they might have gone awol for months on end, but then Aunt Flo can come a-calling without so much as a flowery notelet to warn you of her impending visit. And she’s back with a vengeance. As one friend mourned: “That was the end of my favourite trousers.”
Perimenopause is generally a gradual process that takes you into a fully menopausal state. But don’t underestimate its potency or effects. No one is pretending it’s going to be a barrel of laughs – but it’s not necessarily just doom and gloom.
In the words of someone who’s very recently been there: “It takes a bit of getting used to and you do get forgetful and angry and wider, but it’s not so bad in the winter months as the hot flushes keep you warm. Once you are through it (and try not to kill anyone) and start HRT you will feel like you again, but a better you.”

When death was represented in the neolithic age, it took the form of vultures feasting on headless human corpses. It may be a mark of how far we have come as a species that it can now be represented by Helen Mirren in blue beret and feather boa giving Will Smith a pep talk on a park bench. This is how death manifests itself in Collateral Beauty, a sentimental feel-good drama that will be a grislier proposition to some viewers than any amount of corpse-munching vultures. Mirren provides counsel to a grieving Manhattan man whose life has been hit by tragedy. Her get-up is a cross between Willy Wonka and Roxy Music-era Brian Eno, but then a cowl-and-cape combo is a real mood killer, and who has room in New York to carry a scythe?
Personifications of death in cinema have been predominantly menacing, from the Grim Reaper harvesting an entire dinner party’s worth of guests in Monty Python’s The Meaning of Life – pointing his bony finger at the iffy salmon mousse by way of explanation – to the shovel-faced, multi-eyed Angel of Death in Hellboy 2: The Golden Army and the scarlet-clad figure in The Masque of the Red Death.
Mirren’s interpretation, though, is hardly the first radiant image of mortality to stalk the screen. A Grim Reaper figure mingles backstage at the recording of a radio show in Robert Altman’s final film, A Prairie Home Companion, though with the effervescent Virginia Madsen in the role, wearing springy vanilla curls and a crisp white mackintosh, the reaping was never going to be that grim. Death becomes her.
In the 1962 Twilight Zone episode Nothing in the Dark, it falls to a 25-year-old Robert Redford to convince a terrified elderly woman that there is nothing to fear in crossing to the other side. “You see?” says Redford, glowing handsomely and gesturing to the woman’s dormant body as he leads her spirit away. “No shock. No engulfment. No tearing asunder. What you feared would come like an explosion is like a whisper. What you thought was the end is the beginning.” 
Brad Pitt serves a similarly anaesthetising function in Meet Joe Black, pitching up at the home of dying billionaire Anthony Hopkins to escort him to the afterlife. It’s all remarkably painless for Hopkins, though not for audiences, who may need to check their vital signs after enduring three hours of inspirational waffle just to see him stroll across a symbolic bridge. Death Takes a Holiday, the 1934 romantic comedy on which Meet Joe Black is based, got the job done in less than half that time and with a good deal more charm. 
It also inspired a killer sketch from the 1990s comedy show In Living Color, where Jim Carrey as the Grim Reaper is spotted by star-struck celebrity-spotters who ask him whether Lee Harvey Oswald really acted alone (“That’s for me to know and Oliver Stone to find out,” quips Death). They then implore him to bump someone off for their entertainment.
Carrey’s white-powdered face and swishing black robes owe everything to the dominant image of Death – as played by Bengt Ekerot – in Bergman’s 1957 masterpiece The Seventh Seal, where Max Von Sydow is a knight playing chess against Death in an effort to delay his own demise. That enduring scene was spoofed gloriously in the 1991 comedy Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey, in which Death, played by William Sadler with a strangulated eastern European accent, offers the deceased goofball heroes a chance to win back their lives through a game of their choosing — cue a joyful montage of Death being beaten at Battleship, Cluedo and Twister. 
Sadler had originally tried out this version of Death on a short-lived 1985 sketch show, Assaulted Nuts, which brought together US comic actors with British talent such as Emma Thompson and Tim Brooke-Taylor. “I pulled this funny Czechoslovakian accent out of my butt,” he tells me. “It made the character sound so easily bruised. All you have to do is look at him sideways and he starts to unravel.” In the original sketch, he is disappointed to find that the woman he has come to collect isn’t perturbed in the least: “Aren’t you a-fred juss a leetle beet?” he asks plaintively.
Both Christopher Lloyd and Christopher Walken had been considered for the part in Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey — Walken would eventually get his chance to play Death in the Adam Sandler comedy Click — but Sadler thinks it was his accent that swung it. “I had this character right there in my pocket. He was silly, he was funny, he mangled the language and when he lost at games he became this petulant little boy. You see those cracks in him and he starts to lose all his authority.”
Given freedom to ad lib, Sadler came up with the choice moment when Death spooks a smoker by telling him: “See you real soon.” The actor believes that personifying and ridiculing death is a natural way of coming to terms with it. “It makes it a little less scary. We’re all frightened of death and maybe we need to poke fun at it sometimes, to let the air out of that particular balloon.”
It’s a belief shared by Julian Richings, who played Death in five episodes of the hit TV series Supernatural. “To humanise death, to turn it into someone recognisable and even sympathetic, reduces its power,” he explains. Richings is first seen on Supernatural emerging from his 1959 Cadillac Eldorado (licence plate: BUH-BYE). We can’t help but warm to him from the moment he kills, with one casual flick of the wrist, a mobile-phone-user who bumps into him onto the pavement.
But Death also turns out to be an urbane, chatty, fairly ordinary guy with a penchant for junk food and a nice line in understatement. “I always play against the power of Death,” says Richings. “I never have to show how tough I am. I play up the humorous and wistful qualities instead.All I have to play is my delight at eating this crappy food while everyone knows what I’m really there for.”
There is a tradition of Death as an upper-class Englishman in films such as the 1939 weepie On Borrowed Time, with Cedric Hardwicke coming to claim the elderly Lionel Barrymore, and The Last Action Hero, where Ian McKellen explains he has no dominion over the movie tough-guy played by Arnold Schwarzenegger: “I don’t do fiction. Not my field.”
Richings knows that his own British accent is a boost. “I grew up watching Hammer films so I feel very much in that Peter Cushing tradition.” He played Death again in the Canadian short film Dave vs Death, which borrows the chess-game conceit from The Seventh Seal. “When you look like I do — gaunt, craggy, let’s say ‘interesting’ — you do tend to fall into a certain category of roles,” he sighs.
What these portrayals of death represent ultimately is our defiance in the face of oblivion. Stephen King once noted that Stanley Kubrick regarded horror as essentially reassuring: “He thought that any vein of the supernatural story, whether it is horrifying, or whether it is pleasant, is inherently optimistic because it points towards the possible survival of the spirit.”
The same must be true whenever death is personified. The mere appearance of the Grim Reaper, whichever form it might take, is evidence that there is something on the other side: we wouldn’t need an escort if there were nowhere to be escorted to. Collateral Beauty proves that we aren’t quite ready to stop telling ourselves that story. There’s life in death yet.
Margaret Thatcher has topped a Women’s Hour list of the most influential women of the past 70 years, a choice that even the judges admit was the source of “enormous contention”.
One panel member, Ayesha Hazarika, a former adviser to the Labour MP Harriet Harman, said she felt “uncomfortable” with the choice of Thatcher, but said the list was about celebrating impact “both positive and negative”.
For the past two years, Women’s Hour has compiled a list celebrating the global impact of women on other women. But this year, to mark the BBC Radio 4 programme’s 70th anniversary, the remit of the list was expanded to cover female achievement over the past seven decades.
The panel was made up of seven women, including businesswoman Karren Brady, screenwriter Abi Morgan, former Women’s Hour editor Jill Burridge, and Julia Hobsbawm, the founder of Editorial Intelligence. It was chaired by the journalist Emma Barnett.
Speaking about the decision to put Thatcher, the UK prime minister from 1979 to 1990, in the top spot, Barnett said that, no matter what your view of her politics, “she redefined power”. “Thatcher was one of the most iconic leaders of the 20th century, regardless of gender,” she said. “These are all things you can’t deny. She shaped how women viewed what it was to be a woman in power, from the way people articulated themselves to the way people dressed.
“She shattered the glass ceiling into tiny splinters and just by having a woman in power, little girls knew they could do it – even if it’s not the power you would have wanted.”
Barnett stressed that impact did not always have a positive meaning and pointed out that even for those who viscerally dislike the late Conservative politician, she politically galvanised a new generation of women in opposition to her.
“It would be easy to put seven really worthy women who make you feel warm and gooey inside on this list, but that isn’t what impact means,” said Barnett. “Thatcher spawned a whole other generation of feminists in complete opposition to her and so in some ways her impact was to provoke huge change from the left and beyond.”
Hazarika said that she had “lost the argument about Thatcher” but conceded: “Whether you loved her or loathed her, hers was a very significant achievement. Thatcher shaped a generation and shaped a period in British history.
“I think she had a massively negative impact on society and on women but she was important because she showed that just because you [have] a woman in Downing Street does not mean you have a feminist prime minister or a feminist government.”
The list of seven spans a broad spectrum of women, dead and alive. And not all are household names. Second on the list is Helen Brooks, who set up contraceptive services for women in the UK and – in the words of Barnett – “gave women the key to controlling their own bodies”.
“She changed the lives of unmarried single women. When I went to get the pill for the first time, I didn’t know Helen Brooks’ name and I feel like I should have,” added Barnett.
Also included is the former Labour MP Barbara Castle, who brought in the Equal Pay Act, polarising feminist Germaine Greer, and the performer Beyoncé. Perhaps the most unexpected name on the list is Bridget Jones, Helen Fielding’s hapless fictional character, who burst on to the scene in 1996. The decision to feature Jones caused such disagreement among the panel that Hazarika joked that they almost called the supreme court to arbitrate.
Barnett said that even though Bridget Jones was fictional, she had had an undeniable and valuable impact on the way women were perceived, and could publicly express themselves, over the past two decades.
“Bridget is Marmite on this list, and believe me, it was not an easy discussion – the judges were completely split,” said Barnett. “It’s very easy to pack a list like this with people you should, and people you ought, to have there, but I think we forget that Bridget Jones is our Sex and the City. She’s our flawed heroine, that character which enabled women who didn’t have children, didn’t have the perfect life, to laugh at themselves and feel unashamed of who they are.”
Hazarika was also among those who had voted in favour of the character. “We wanted the good, the worthy, the brave, the liberating, the fierce – but we also wanted a bit of the fun on our list,” she said.
Hazarika said the blow of Thatcher topping the list had been softened by the inclusion of her wildcard suggestion, Jayaben Desai, the prominent 1976 Grunwick strike leader who campaigned against low pay and poor conditions.
“Jayaben was this tiny 4ft 8in woman in a sari who had dockers and postal workers from across the land coming to support her on the picket line,” said Hazarika. “She made trade unions realise solidarity was not just for white working-class men, but spanned right across immigrants and women as well. So it was great to be able to shine a bit of light on her and her story.”

Loneliness at Christmas: how are you tackling it?
Sometimes parenting is a survival game and, like our evolutionary predecessors fending away wolves with burning sticks, we’ll take just about any tool at our disposal. For me, bleary-eyed and exhausted, my five-month-old son asleep in my arms at four o’clock in the morning, that tool was an exercise ball to bounce him back to sleep (we later graduated to a rocking chair).
It’s not perfect. I still need to be awake and somewhat attentive but it does the job, especially as he’s a relatively good sleeper anyway.
But recently, while trying to settle him, I stumbled across a better solution online: the Snoo baby crib rocks an upset baby back to sleep and then slows down to keep him or her soothed and snoozing. It picks the ideal white noise for the situation. A combination of sleep deprivation and the angelic glow of my smartphone screen gave the crib a nearly Messianic quality. At last, a tool to give all of us some sleep.
By this stage I’d been settling for two hours. Through the delirium my mind started racing: it’s all well and good to be able to rock a baby back to sleep – what if you could put them in fully awake and have the crib do all the work? Could artificial intelligence work out how to feed a bottle? It’d need a refrigeration unit but that shouldn’t be too difficult …
In my desperate madness, I proceeded to design a machine that would effectively make me redundant in my son’s life for the next few months.
The logic of technological entrepreneurship is the logic of progress: once we’ve found a way to technologise something, we want to know how far we can push it. Cars can double as chauffeurs, phones as personal assistants, cribs as parents, the list goes on.
There’s nothing intrinsically wrong with technological innovation. Engineering is precisely the art of providing tools to allow humans to get on with the business of being human without being impeded by unnecessary inconvenience.
But technology always primes social values in particular ways. It’s unlikely that technological disruptions of parenting will be any different. Just as global access to information has changed our appetite to pay for news, technologies that make parenting easier can prompt unexpected behaviour.
For instance, with parents able to get a good night’s sleep quickly and easily, there may be less pressure for secondary carers – often fathers – to take additional time off work to help care for their partner and child. Might this surreptitiously displace working parents from the home earlier than they otherwise might have chosen? A number of new families I’ve met have joked about how eager the mother was to send their partner back to work to have them “out of the way” – technology like this might expedite the process.
On the bright side, it might also provide much-needed relief to single parents and those working multiple jobs to make ends meet; providing them the opportunity to rest, explore other opportunities for income or take some time for self-care. Yet those who need to work two jobs are also those with the least discretionary income to spend on robotic cribs for their children. Although good in theory, the crib might not be available to those who need them most until they can be produced cheaply at scale.
There is also a question as to how this and similar technologies could alter our conceptions of parenting itself. When I contemplated fatherhood, part of what I was committing to was bleary-eyed, sleepless nights trying to wrestle a little one back to bed. This wasn’t a necessary evil, it was a defining aspect of being a parent – an exercise of self-sacrifice, presence and solidarity with my partner. If, as Snoo promises, “exhaustion is optional”, will manually settling your child move from an essential part of parenting into a fringe activity done by purists? If so, there might be unforeseen consequences.
Once I returned to work after my paternity leave, settling my son back to sleep was on some days the only time I had with him. LED–illuminated cuddles were the only moments I had with my boy; but I was exhausted and, if presented with another option, I might have been tempted – a decision I might have regretted knowing what I do now. For me, giving up my sleep was the only tangible way I could connect to my son and my new role as a father.
Perhaps our baby wouldn’t have been any worse off soothing in a crib – though I suspect there’d be fierce debate on that point. But I have a feeling my parenting might have. Until recently, sleep rituals, nappy changes and burping weren’t menial tasks that distracted from the real business of parenting; they were the defining experiences of it. In many ways, they still are.
Maida Lynn Chen, director of the Pediatric Sleep Center at Seattle children’s hospital, thinks similarly. She told the Washington Post, “There are certain triumphs to parenting, such as figuring out your child’s cues and being able to soothe your baby in some shape or form. Really developing and growing, as a parent, your skill set to try to figure out [why the baby is crying], I think that’s part of the parenting process.”
Andy Warhol advised people to allow the things that bore them to become thrilling instead. I’m not sure if he had parenting in mind but he may as well have. Technology can make our lives easier but to pursue ease and comfort merely because we can might also make them emptier.
I feel a thrill when my son falls asleep in my arms. In my better moments, I feel a thrill when he grunts to announce he’s awake. With the wisdom of perspective, they aren’t thrills I’d trade for smaller bags under my eyes. And I’m not sure what kind of a dad I’d be if I did.
Richard Layard is promoting the idea that better provision of mental health services is more important than reducing social inequalities in promoting human happiness (Happiness depends on health and friends, not money, says new study, theguardian.com, 12 December). This is a false dichotomy. Evidence suggests that austerity damages our collective health. Deepening economic and social divides, bullying, abuse, misogyny, racism, dehumanisation and consequent insecurity, trauma, social exclusion, neglect and despair underpin the current tsunami of desolation in the UK and beyond, especially in our children. These are largely economic and political matters, requiring cultural, social and political solutions. Psychological therapies, humanely delivered to those who want them, have a part to play in ameliorating human suffering, and we do need more flexible, kind and supportive services. But we must not pathologise those who are damaged by the injustices they experience. Degradation by the benefits system is now devastating many with long-term illnesses in the UK. To imagine that therapy, rather than social transformation, can address or prevent the conditions that lead to despair is to be wilfully blind.

• Workplace happiness is not about the trivial (The cult of compulsory happiness is ruining our workplaces, 12 December). Micromanagement, being told what to do and blame cultures are the kind of things that make people unhappy at work. Instead, enable people to do work they are good at, give them the trust and freedom to do it well, have managers who coach rather than tell, and create a no-blame environment. The result will be happier staff and more productive organisations.

The “Orwellian” schmoozing of young people in schools along the proposed HS2 route (Report, 12 December) pales into insignificance alongside the efforts of the nuclear industry to ingratiate itself with the community around the Magnox nuclear power station at Bradwell-on-Sea in Essex. Some 20 or more years ago Girl Guides staged an enrolment ceremony while standing on the pile cap of the then active nuclear reactor.

• The inhabitants of Mata Hari’s home city would not be pleased to read that they live in “Friesland, Holland” (Mother, dancer, wife, spy, G2, 6 December). Friesland, one of the 12 provinces of the Netherlands, has its own language, literature and proud history. North and South Holland are merely two other provinces of the same country. My Frisian husband, having lived in London for over 40 years, recently acquired a second passport. He became a British citizen – not an English one. It’s pretty much the same difference.

• Challenging times for small-scale poultry keepers (Owners told to keep poultry inside amid bird flu alert, 8 December). Our solution, for normally free-range hens, is a trampoline draped in pegged-down fruit netting, attached to the small chicken house. At least they can still have dust baths and peck around. How are others resolving the situation?

• I’m 62 and not sure if I count as an older woman, but my two daughters, now 30 and 26, played with Barbies and had pink rollerblades when they were little. They also played with snails, climbed trees and surfed. Most importantly, they had inspirational science teachers and are both now scientists themselves. There’s more to bringing up children than toys, whatever colour they are (Letters, 12 December).

Aside from its quality, there is one key reason Fawlty Towers hasn’t aged as badly as its contemporaries: the edits. Its producers doubled the average number of cuts per episode, to something approaching what’s common today. So rather than proceeding with the creak and tedium of, say, Bless This House, it whips along – despite stagey blocking, despite farce roots.
But the reason it still feels culturally distant – as testified by the repeat last week of the brilliant Communication Difficulties to commemorate the death of Andrew Sachs – is that its primary preoccupation is class. Sitcoms in the 70s were fixated on the thwarted social ambitions of middle-aged men. The first ever Fawlty Towers episode in 1975 sees Basil hoodwinked by an upper-crust conman; two months later, in an episode of Rising Damp, Rigsby falls victim to the exact same scam. The achilles heel of these two and numerous others was a desperation to rise above the riffraff.
Last Saturday saw an airing, without obvious peg, of the last ever episode of Dad’s Army – immediately identifiable as such by the baggy pace, heady sentimentality and genuinely immense age of the cast (you don’t see wrinkles as distinguished as John Le Mesurier’s on primetime any more). That series hinged on the tension of Mainwaring’s attempts to assert authority over the polished public schoolboy Wilson. Made in 1977, the episode includes a beautifully played heart-to-heart in which Mainwaring explains how he himself battled snobbishness to marry the daughter of the Suffragan Bishop of Clegthorpe [sic], whom he’d had to introduce to ketchup. “Marrying you must have opened up a whole new world for her,” nods Wilson, winningly.
Today, class tension is not a live issue in anything like the same way. The departure of David Cameron has loosened the Eton stranglehold a little. The rage of the squeezed middle, more than the squashed poor, is credited for Brexit. Quietly, the inequality gaps have become about wealth itself, as well as gender, race and sexuality – not class. Accordingly, today’s acclaimed British sitcoms – Fleabag, Motherland, Mum, Catastrophe – are not about a 50-year-old property owner failing to better himself. They’re about women struggling with sex, rent, men and children. And sometimes they’re almost as funny. Sometimes.
Magazines at the moment are chocka with frocks for this year’s festive dos. The slinkiest heels to take you from work to party to A&E, the best clutches to leave on the bus. Pregnancy relieves you of such concerns: whatever you wear you’ll just look whopping, yet people will feel the need to not be too bitchy.
But, in fact, such sartorial loopholes are available to all, for the dominant aesthetic of Christmas secretly conspires against the dress code dictated by the Sunday supplements. Turn up at a party wearing oversized pullover featuring gurning turkey, and people will applaud your seasonal cheer. Hair is granted a particularly free pass, with everyday outfits allowed to be capped with a bobble hat. Even at posh suppers, the wearing of a paper crown from the cracker is actively encouraged. If you look a tip, Christmas is truly a gift.
I’ve been given a couple of nice watches for Christmas, and proved horribly adept at losing them. They were lovely but, I hope, not massively expensive. Investing an inordinate amount of money in something not only that you’re likely to take off a lot, but that is so conspicuous, so eminently stealable, has long seemed strange to me.
So it’s good to see the world’s super-wealthy are cottoning on. Not only have sales of Rolexes plummeted this year, but the incidence of them being returned for a refund has skyrocketed. The credit crunch is thanked, but I think it’s more down to the eventual emergence of common sense. Plus, of course, nobody needs a watch any more.
The most influential outfit of the year featured no clothes at all. When Kim Kardashian posted a hotel-bathroom nude selfie on Instagram back in March, she kickstarted a row over how this peculiarly narcissistic form of self-expression squares with its advocate’s self-proclaimed feminism. Should you doubt the impact this image had on our fashion psyche, consider this: shopping site Lyst reported a 400% rise in searches for black bandeau bikinis that would recreate the effect of the black censorship bars. Yes, censor-bar chic is a thing. At Paris fashion week, a few weeks later, Kim’s sister Kendall wore a minimalist black bandeau top that echoed Kim’s look. With it, she wore a black ribbon choker, a trend that has been worn by every female celebrity under 25 this year, and is now all over the high street. If you are a teen girl, you are so getting a Claire’s choker in your stocking. Which is odd, because a choker is as rude as jewellery gets. The meaning of the choker is, basically, nudity: see Manet’s Olympia.
A year is a long time in social media. I mean, an hour is a long time in social media, so where to start? But, the topline is: 2016 was the year Instagram became a competitive sport. In fashion, “winning” at Instagram is now a thing. It turns out that the whole of 2015 was the equivalent of that bit before the Wimbledon final when Andy Murray and whoever that other man was knocked balls back and forth across the net, before the umpire called time and the match actually started. If you still think Instagram is for, I dunno, drunken taxi selfies, then you need to up your game. Instagram is now LinkedIn for the beautiful people. If you don’t believe me, take a look at Selena Gomez, who has 104 million followers on Instagram and is cleaning up on the fashion pay cheque front – with a Louis Vuitton campaign under her belt, Gomez just signed a $13m (£10.2m) deal to be the face of Coach. That may not be an attainable goal for everyone. But next time you take a back-of-the-cab selfie, maybe FaceTune it at least, OK?
From Bardot tops on summer holidays to cut-out knitwear for autumn, with off-the-shoulder wedding dresses and cold-shoulder blouses in between, shoulder-exposure has been this year’s standout detail. If you ever find yourself adrift in the aforementioned space time continuum and needing to find your way back to 2016, you can reorientate yourself by following the clavicles. The cold shoulder hit the spot this year because it encapsulates our love-hate relationship with nudity: the spotlight is on skin, but the whole point of the look is that the rest of you is covered up. The perfect look for a messed-up year.
You will recall that in Back to the Future (1985), Doc explains that if Jennifer comes face to face with her older self, “the encounter could create a time paradox, the results of which could cause a chain reaction which would unravel the very fabric of the space-time continuum”. This is exactly where we are now, in fashion. In the year of the Timelapse and Boomerang video trends and of Stranger Things’ Upside Down, fashion has disrupted its own timeline with the arrival of see now buy now. See now buy now means that the status quo, whereby clothes arrived on the catwalk six months before they arrived in shops, has been hijacked. Some catwalk collections, such as Burberry’s, are available in stores hours after the show; others get looped back to a season later. (To add a layer of complexity, Christopher Bailey themed the Burberry collection around Virginia Woolf’s time-travel classic, Orlando.) For people in fashion, this is all very discombobulating, similar to when the post stopped coming at breakfast time like clockwork, and started randomly arriving mid afternoon. The upside is: you can start wearing a trend during fashion week or wait six months, and either counts as being on trend.
Fashion’s big moments are no longer the domain of fashion week and the Oscars, and as many of the key style moments of 2016 have happened in state rooms as they have on catwalks. Case in point: Tina Fey rocked Versace on the Oscars red carpet and Zayn wore bespoke Versace armoured sleeves at the Met Ball, but no one rocked Versace in 2016 like Michelle Obama did in goddess sequins at her last state dinner. Likewise, the streets of Paris and Milan were literally swarming with wannabe street-style stars doing a dressed-up pyjama look during the last fashion month, but none of them came close, for cuteness, to Prince George meeting the president in his fluffy dressing gown. From Melania Trump’s pussy-bow blouse to Theresa May’s leather trousers, this was a year when the biggest fashion news happened on the actual news.
If you had to put one piece of 2016 in a time capsule to represent this year in style, it would be Vetements sock-boots with the unicorn heel. Except it would be impossible, because those boots sold out months ago and are only available online for double their original retail price, and if you find a pair in my size I will wrestle you to the ground for them. Vetements, the cult Paris brand that turned the DHL into a style icon, has turned fashion upside down by subverting every rule of what’s haute and what’s not. After Vetements put a Justin4Ever T-shirt on their catwalk, Bieber brought out Vetements-inspired tour merchandise that became this summer’s hottest look whichever after-party you were at. What does it mean? Who can we believe, in a world where Tom Hiddleston responds to accusations that loved-up photos with Taylor Swift are staged by wearing an I ♥ TS vest in what look even more like staged loved-up photos with Taylor Swift? Reality is so last year. Snuggle up in your mermaid blanket and dream of Santa coming down the chimney with size six unicorn boots.
Do I need to spell it out? In 2016, we worshipped the Hadids. The new holy family of fashion are models Gigi (21), Bella (20) and their mother Yolanda. For the benefit of those who – bafflingly – perhaps don’t follow such things in granular details, the narrative arc of 2016 developed when Gigi, having established a power base via a strategic alliance with Kendall Jenner (scion of the Kardashian sex-tape and lip-gloss fortune) repositioned herself in the celebrity firmament alongside her sister. To consolidate the in-house brand, if you like. The scope of ambition of the Hadids can be seen in the increased visibility of Yolanda, who accompanied Gigi to the Fashion awards, because you are no one without a momager.
The skinny jean entrenched itself in power a decade ago and hung on doggedly longer than anyone would have predicted. But now a crazy new generation of denim has succeeded where more low-key new looks have failed. We had the boyfriend jean, the girlfriend jean, the skinny boyfriend jean, the Mom jean – a whole extended family of jean shapes attempted to oust the skinny, without real success. But this year, along came a whole new beast in the Frankenstein jean, as invented by Vetements, which remade jeans by chopping and patching. (Look for the distinctive mullet-stepped hem.) If you are not wearing them yet, you will be.
If Barbie is in the market for a seasonal spinoff that would sell like hot cakes at the close of 2016, it should go for Meaningful Beyoncé. Meaningful Beyoncé slayed all comers this year. At the Superbowl, she reinvented the leotard as Black Panther homage. With Lemonade, she rocked the world with a visual essay on the inner lives of black women. As living proof of the fact that a female celebrity can use her image and her beauty to say something more interesting and more genuinely empowering than “women are beautiful – like, just look at my breasts!”* Beyoncé is, to use the most overused word of 2016, an inspiration.
*paging Emily Ratajkowski
Such is the primacy of the Kardashian clan in popular culture that no recap of the year would be complete without them. But this year was different. It was season 12 in Keeping Up With the Kardashians, but it is best viewed as Act three of The Kardashians. The connection (via Kim’s father, Rob Kardashian) to the awful deeds behind spring’s TV hit The People v OJ Simpson felt prescient at Paris fashion week, when Kim Kardashian was held hostage in her apartment. The story that had been a diverting soap opera became genuinely horrifying. Weirdly, the most high-profile outing for any of the Kardashians in the period since was Kendall Jenner at the Victoria’s Secret show, where she won the hard-fought prize of Most Tasteless outfit on the catwalk by wearing lingerie with what appeared to be a neck-brace.
The latest Pirelli calendar, shot by Peter Lindberg, is a landmark moment. It represents fashion coming to terms with the fact that the world has moved on from an aesthetic landscape peopled only by young, slim, heavily made-up and then even more heavily Photoshopped women. The calendar features older women – Uma Thurman, Helen Mirren, Julianne Moore – and there is more knitwear than swimwear. Lindberg’s comment that the photos were “a cry for beauty today against the terror of perfection and youth” echoed the launch a week later of Reebok’s #PerfectNever campaign, which purports to question images of body perfection (while, confusingly, putting Gigi Hadid onstage in a crop top, but there you go.) This year, the No Make Up selfie was more aspirational than any amount of contouring.
“Millennial pink”, “not pink pink”, “rose quartz” – call it what you like. It’s the colour of now. See: the limited-edition windowpane blanket made for the Gentlewoman magazine by Paul Smith; the cape-fronted pink dress from Céline’s most recent collection.
In 2016, Paris lost its style pre-eminence. Rio had the Olympics, and a futuristic Louis Vuitton Cruise catwalk show. But Cuba, where Chanel staged their Cruise show, had a serious style moment. Karl Lagerfeld’s decision to use the streets of Havana as a shabby-chic theatrical backdrop for eyewateringly expensive clothes may have raised a few brows, but it has brought the chic tourists flocking.
Is it a girl, is it a boy? In 2016, the only appropriate answer is: who cares? That gender neutrality is now solidly embedded in fashion could be seen in Jaden Smith wearing womenswear for Louis Vuitton, and in the many brands that have merged their mens and womens’ collections on the catwalk. But never mind that, look at the shoes. The Gucci loafer – iconic gender-neutral shoe – was everywhere this year. As for where this will go next, well, Alessandro Michele, Gucci designer and mastermind of the loafer revival, has taken to wearing pearl-buttoned Mary Janes.
Subtext: “My usual Saturday? Oh, you know, a juice before Pilates. Then brunch, of course!”
One name in the long, long list of extraordinary people we lost in 2016 is photographer Bill Cunningham, the godfather of streetstyle, who more or less invented the genre with his spreads in the New York Times. But streetstyle means something different these days: essentially, sponsored clickbait designed to flog blue shirts/Frankenstein jeans/cold-shoulder tops.
Better than a white shirt in 2016 – and going strong into next year. Not everything has to be complicated, thank goodness.
How does the advent of velvet as this year’s fabric fit with the continued ascendancy of athleisure? It doesn’t, obviously. But in the words of Karl Lagerfeld: “Fashion is about two things – the evolution and the opposite.” The forces of physics are in play here. Which is good news, because no one wants to eat Christmas dinner in a crop top and sucky leggings.
In 2016 it’s not where your coat is from, it’s how you wear it. Specifically: falling back off both shoulders, as modelled on the Balenciaga catwalk in March and by any celebrity with access to the internet ever since. The point of this look is that it separates the act of wearing a coat from such pedestrian concerns as keeping warm. Wearing your coat like this denies the existence of winter. It is a style tic that would drive your mum crazy, and would likely snub the Paris agreement on climate change. But, y’know, it does look good.
What ingredients are required to make an ultramarathon runner? In Boulder, Colorado, Scott Jurek has concocted quite the recipe that has kept him going the distance for the past two decades. He runs anywhere between 50 miles to over 150 miles, and in his lifetime has won over 20 ultramarathons, smashing records along the way. His passion for running kickstarted his morning regimen in 1997, when he cut out meat completely. In 1999, he transitioned to a plant-based diet, which has since fueled his long-distance running career. On an average day, Scott runs about 10 miles, and this is typically before the sun rises over the beautiful Boulder Flatirons.
What we do when we wake up in the morning sets the tone for our days and ultimately shapes our lives. In this new series, we take a look at how the hyper-successful among us have leveraged rituals to create the trajectories they want.
The work of rock band AC/DC may not be an obvious festive choice, but for wily board game players it could come to define the sound of every Christmas to come. Research by Imperial College London and the Royal College of Music found that rock music can distract men (but not women) “undertaking complex surgical procedures” in the game Operation. In the experiment, 352 volunteers with no previous surgical training were given either a Mozart piano sonata, Thunderstruck by AC/DC or a recording of operating theatre sounds to listen to while removing the patient’s wishbone, Adam’s apple and that weird plastic horse; those listening to AC/DC fared the worst. But what else could put off your opponents and ensure you are board-game champion this Christmas?
You can see why games such as the life-or-death Operation (or the lower-stakes Buckaroo) require hush – you need concentration and a steady hand. So, playing loud rock music might deter your opponent, but this wouldn’t work with, say, Hungry Hippos, where a bit of Highway to Hell may aid play. Choose wisely.
If the person you’re playing against is the type who gets irritated at someone going 20mph in a 30mph zone, draw inspiration from snooker’s Peter Ebdon. He is notoriously slow and appears fond of lengthy loo breaks. Although he denies it is deliberate, it can rile his opponents. During one match, Ronnie O’Sullivan pretended to go to sleep while Ebdon was taking his time (Ebdon won). Would work well for Scrabble.
Take advantage of the one day when it’s socially acceptable to have booze for breakfast. Alcohol impairs judgment, coordination, speech and other essential gaming skills. It would be totally wrong to get someone drunk before suggesting a bout of Carcassone, but it’s fair to choose favourable timing. “When the enemy is relaxed, make them toil,” as military strategist Sun Tzu famously noted about the game Twister in The Art of War.
Cricketers are known for their often deeply personal, and occasionally witty, barbs. Sledging is the art of chatting to your opponent in an effort to destroy their concentration. You may choose to deploy taunts about your relations’ debts or weight gain during a game of Boggle. “Sledging can work to distract your opponent and get them thinking about something other than the game,” says Paul Davis, associate professor in the department of psychology at Sweden’s Umeå University, who has researched sledging. “It raises people’s emotions; it might get them angry and out of their ideal performance state, rather than thinking about strategy. Emotions also have a physiological impact, in terms of raising heart rate and affecting muscle tension. If you are playing a game that requires dexterity or coordination, anger, anxiety, frustration and guilt can all have an effect on physiological balance.” You’d have to be ultra-competitive to use it, however. “You have to ask yourself: how important is it to win the match, or would you prefer to come through the festive season successfully, without any family blow-ups?”
My mother, Jennifer Jones, who has died aged 82, devoted her life to helping others in humble ways. Hers was a life of privilege – she was born into the famous Pilkington glassmaking family – but it was not without the severest of tests, with her mother and sister both dying young.
Daughter of Rosalind (nee Rowan) and Sir Harry (later Lord) Pilkington, she was born in St Helens, Merseyside, and educated at Cheltenham Ladies’ college. At Bristol University, her moral compass was set and she became a prominent member of the Student Christian Movement. On graduating with a first in history, philosophy and theology, she was given a job with the movement. At her graduation, her father remarked that he did not realise he had a genius for a daughter – to which her tutor replied, “You don’t. But you do have a daughter who works incredibly hard!”
On a work visit to Bolton Teacher Training College, she met Dennis Jones, a student there: they were engaged within a week and married in 1958, before moving to Leicestershire when Dennis took up a teaching post at the technical college in Hinckley.
Despite the workload of three children early in the marriage, Jennifer felt compelled to become a teacher. She trained at Leicester University and taught locally at Huncote junior school, moving to the junior school in Burbage, a suburb of Hinckley, in 1974. There she remained involved in various roles until a few weeks before she died.
But it was in her commitment to the community that Jennifer shone. As a member of her local church, she led weekly Bible study groups and undertook herculean amounts of bereavement visiting – at one time supporting more than 80 families. And for more than 25 years, she collected and delivered laundry for elderly people, volunteering for the WRVS.
Jennifer was a keen activist on environmental matters, going on marches in the UK and overseas. She was a parish councillor and campaigned for the Liberal Democrats for many years. She was a non-executive director of the George Eliot hospital in Nuneaton, where her children had been born.
Jennifer displayed the same commitment in her own pastimes, singing in the local choral union for more than 40 years. She was a dedicated cyclist and even in the last year of her life cycled more than 3,500 miles. Every year, she would pedal to visit more than 40 elderly people at Christmas time – giving each a homemade mince pie. But she was never happier than in the garden that she tended expertly.
Dennis died in 1996. Jennifer is survived by her children, Andrew, Penny and me, six grandchildren and her brother, John.
 Platt adds: ‘We keep them until the week before Christmas, kill them, pluck them, hang them for two or three days, dress them and they’re gone, no hanging about. We’ve had orders from the same families for 50 years. My dad did it and we’ve still got the same orders he had so they must be good turkeys’
Wipe a couple of large sweet potatoes and put them in the oven to bake. They should take between 45-60 minutes at 200C/gas mark 6.
Trim 250g of brussels sprouts, discarding any discoloured leaves and removing any dry stalks. Cut each sprout into four. Warm 3 tbsp of olive oil and a thin slice of butter in a shallow pan, add the sprouts then cook them over a moderate heat for about 10-15 minutes until they have softened and are light gold in colour. Pour in 200ml double cream, then stir in 1 tbsp each of smooth Dijon and whole grain mustard. Finish with a generous grinding of salt and pepper.
Let the cream simmer for 3 or 4 minutes until it starts to thicken. When the potatoes are done, split them in half and spoon the Brussels and mustard cream sauce over them.
Nothing complicated here, but when you have poured the cream into the hot pan then watch carefully as it reduces. Let the cream bubble gently over a moderate heat, stir occasionally, regularly checking its consistency. When the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon it is ready.
A large celeriac, in place of the sweet potato, will bake sweetly enough if wrapped in buttered foil and cooked at a low temperature. Any of the brassicas will be happy in the cream and mustard sauce. Shredded cavolo nero, black cabbage, could be substituted for the spouts, as could dark green savoy and chopped long-stemmed broccoli.

With stories of tragic deaths, riots, audacious escapes, drug-fuelled violence and chronic staff shortages increasingly prevalent across the prison system, and the former head of the service claiming that the current crisis will take years to sort out, it might seem a strange time to call for more fruit and veg to be introduced into prisoners’ diets. But the way we feed prisoners has never been more important.
Last year an inmate at HMP Northumberland staged a protest on a high railing after being served a cold meal, while a report released by HM Inspectorate of Prisons a few months ago concluded that poor nutrition is contributing to the current state of disorder, from Bedford to Belmarsh.
“Studies have found that nutritional supplements reduce disciplinary incidents, aggression and violent behaviour,” the inspectors noted. “In other words, prisoners eating well is not just a matter of prisoner wellbeing but is also of practical and financial concern to the prison service.”
Recently I spent some time talking to prisoners and former prison staff about this, and came away convinced that food is even more important than the inspectors claimed.
I spoke to one woman who served a short sentence of seven weeks earlier this year. She contacted me to talk about her experience of prison food (or, in her words, “the lack of it”) as a pregnant woman who was also lactose-intolerant. The prison kitchen was notified of her diagnosed intolerance and the fact she was six months pregnant. Soya milk was promised to substitute the dairy milk received daily by all prisoners in their breakfast pack. Additional calories were also promised.
Four and a half weeks later, she had received no form of milk that she was able to drink and spent most of her time chasing up staff members who continually assured her they would rectify the situation. Coupled with carb-heavy meals lacking fresh fruit or vegetables (“No one wants to eat pasta and chips in the same meal. It’s just not normal,” she told me) and none of the extra calories she was promised, she went on to lose half a stone. Another pregnant inmate cried herself to sleep every night because she was so hungry.
“Your punishment is to have your freedom taken away from you – not to be starved or have your health compromised,” she said. And I couldn’t have put it better myself.
Another woman I spoke to found that prison had the opposite effect on her weight. She put on five stone during her three years in prison. She and her cellmates took daily doses of Laxido (a powdered form of laxative) to help pass the food and worked in the prison vegetable patch – only to find the produce grown there went to local restaurants, not the prison kitchen.
With 46% of adult prisoners reconvicted within a year of release and prison deaths and self-harm at record levels, we are feeding some of society’s most vulnerable and mentally unstable individuals food that is damaging them further. Prison, of course, is a place of punishment – but is also meant to change the people serving time in them for the better. How are they meant to leave prison in a healthier physical and mental state of mind, when they aren’t properly fed?
Of course food is far from the only problem in prisons, but that doesn’t mean improving it is not important. When Jamie Oliver campaigned against chicken nuggets and Turkey Twizzlers in school meals in 2006, viewers watched children’s behaviour improve and classrooms become calmer, more civil places. Something similar could happen in prisons, if we only stopped ignoring their kitchens. For starters, how about justice secretary Liz Truss joining prisoners for a meal?

Imagine you’re a mother arriving at court, fighting for the right to keep your baby who was removed from you just after birth. Your local authority now says your child should be adopted. Despite everything your barrister has told you about the rigour of adoption law, you will arrive in front of the judge today with even less trust than you had before.
And the reason you have lost your last shred of faith is because your council is one of 12 in England that have been shown to set targets for the number of children they aim to have adopted. As a result of several years spent reporting on care and adoption cases, I’m now a committee member of the Transparency Project, a Bristol-based charity dedicated to increasing understanding of family law. It was this charity that made the freedom of information requests that led to councils confirming that percentage or numerical adoption targets were being operated for children in care.
Some councils were open about it. South Gloucestershire’s answer, for example, stated clearly that its adoption target for 2014-15 was 12 children – up from nine the year before. Some denied using targets, but then sent – perhaps inadvertently – internal documents that demonstrated that they did. Cambridgeshire council, which said it didn’t set targets, emailed over a document stating that if its target of 40 adoptions was exceeded, it would need to recruit more staff.
Nottingham said it worked to a variety of benchmarks, and didn’t mention numerical targets: however it also sent a progress report submitted to the Department for Education that said: “NCC has set an ambitious target of ensuring 55 children exit care with an Adoption Order by 31 March 2014.” The East Riding of Yorkshire sent documents showing that the government had imposed targets during the year 2012-13 by way of an improvement notice.
The ultimate decision to place a child for adoption is always taken by a family court judge. But local authorities influence what happens in court, and councils having targets for the number of children to be adopted is ethically repugnant. The right to a family life – where this is safe – is a human right enjoyed by both parents and children. The decision to place a child for adoption must be focused solely on what is the right outcome for that child. Every professional involved should be driven by this motivation alone. Put simply, our laws mean that 100% of children in care being adopted could be the right number – or none at all.
This is not a matter of dry legalese: if you believe in human rights, targets in adoption are dangerous. One risk is that children are earmarked for adoption very young, even when their mothers are pregnant when, if priorities were different, alternative solutions might be found. There are also obligations in case law for councils to put in place support enabling families to stay together. But a number of published judgments have made it increasingly clear that those resources are often squeezed reluctantly out of council coffers, which are down to their last few pennies due to successive rounds of cuts.
Unlike the days when there was enormous social stigma attached to being an unmarried mother, virtually no parents these days voluntarily give up a child for adoption. The most recent figures nevertheless show that 4,690 children were adopted in the year ending 31 March 2016. While the UK is far from the only European country to allow adoption without parental consent, research shows that it is unique in pursuing it so vigorously. In the Netherlands, for example, the average number of adoptions annually is 28.
When the latest adoption statistics showed a drop, this prompted agonised hand-wringing from the government and pro-adoption charities which insist that more adoption, done faster, is the right way to go. In the context of cuts, combined with a sustained government push for more adoption, it is worth remembering that adoption is far cheaper for a council than a foster placement, costing around £35,000 per year – because once adopted, that child is off the council’s books for good. Adoption is cheaper too than providing services that might ensure vulnerable parents can care for their children safely within their birth families.
Compounding the ethical problems of numerical targets are indications from some of the FOI responses that children’s services departments have on occasion been judged by Ofsted inspectors on whether they meet them.
The Catholic church in England and Wales recently apologised for its role in removing children from their unmarried mothers for adoption in the period between the 1950s and the 1970s. Imagine that you, 20 or 30 years from now, found out that your adoption might have been the result of a council target. How much trust would you have in the quality of the decision-making that changed your life?
Earlier this year I received the following email from a family lawyer: “Many in Europe believe that in the future, the UK government will be apologising to a generation of children who were swiftly and forcibly adopted through our family courts.” The lawyer believes such concerns to be justified. So do I.

Your choice of verb (NHS crisis exiles children to Scotland for specialist care, 12 December) must have made many Scottish readers sigh. “Exile” is an emotive way to describe a journey to the top third of our island. It shows an attitude all too commonly found in articles about anything from national house prices to public transport, where “the north” turns out to mean nothing further north than Newcastle, and where “national” maps are sometimes cut off at the Borders. Your headline could just as well have read “Scotland’s specialist care units welcome children denied beds in England”.

• Ho ho ho? No no no! Far from being “false news”, as Kevin Meethan asserts (Letters, 12 December), the existence of Father Christmas is a superb contemporary example of profound myth. The good news is, there is more than one kind of truth; the false news is that “existence” is limited to certain physical forms. Christians believe that Christ is, in some sense, the “logos” truth; this casts no doubt whatsoever on the fact that Father Christmas is the “mythos” truth in which so many “millions” of us are currently (merrily) “colluding”.

All the huffing and puffing by the English Premiership about its protocols regarding the pitch-side assessment of a rugby player who might have been badly concussed (Report, 9 December) amount to a dereliction of duty. Protocols are frankly worthless unless there has been an established baseline recorded on each player in the off-season. Rugby players, footballers, boxers, jockeys, polo players, bikers et al need to have their brain scanned.
When a player comes off or falls off having had a bang on the head, he or she should stay off. He/she should have a second scan and these two records should then be compared. They should also be kept so the player has a continuous record of his/her brain in case in later life he or she develops dementia. It is important that all sporting bodies recognise their duty of care to their players and performers. This lasts even when they have retired.

I see that there is a bit of to-do in the papers about Nicky Morgan’s criticism of Theresa May’s trousers. What’s going on?
Tchuh, women! Can’t live with ’em, can’t return them to Asos.com either. So while the global political world burns, with Putin now the president of America, and a quasi Vichy regime creeping ever closer to the Élysée Palace, the big political story in Britain is Theresa May’s leather trousers versus Nicky Morgan’s Mulberry handbag. And to think, some of us thought a post-Brexit Britain would become a political irrelevancy.
The story, as it currently stands, is that May wore some leather trousers when she was photographed for a newspaper. These trousers, it later transpired, cost £995, and Nicky Morgan duly seized that predictable bait and snorted, “I don’t think I’ve ever spent that much on anything apart from my wedding dress.” After all, she added, while possibly patting a young local ruffian on the head, “My barometer is always, ‘How am I going to explain this in Loughborough market?” I think this was Morgan’s clueless way of saying she keeps it real, but it didn’t really work because those trousers looked exactly like the kind of thing sold in my local market, which, just this weekend, alongside the £1 Christmas crackers, was selling leather bustiers and disgusting, studded leather jackets. Hot shopping tip to the leather fan at the back, Theresa! But I digress.
Anyway, May’s joint chief of staff, Fiona Hill, was so outraged by Morgan’s fashion critique that she pettily disinvited “that woman” from 10 Downing Street, “so there!” The leather worm then turned further for Morgan when it was pointed out that her Mulberry handbag cost almost exactly the same as May’s trousers. Morgan insisted the bag was “a gift”, because expensive stuff is totally fine as long as you don’t pay for it, apparently. But this in itself raised several questions, not least, “Who is giving Nicky Morgan £950 handbags?” Someone in Loughborough market, no doubt, out of gratitude for her longstanding policy of being so condescendingly real to them.
So the first thing to say, obviously, is, again, tchuh women! The sight of the second woman prime minister and the former secretary of state for education spatting away about trousers and handbags seems pretty much the right way to end a year marked by the resurgence of misogyny in western politics. That’s right, ladies: you keep behaving like the worst possible stereotypes of women, and don’t let all that leather slow you down. That’ll show ‘em.
The second thing is, it really is impressive how ignorant both Morgan and the media seem to be about how much men’s suits cost. Sure, a grand is a lot to spend on a pair of trousers or handbag, but a fair few male MPs own suits that cost at least as much, and I have never heard anyone suggest this proves those men are modern-day Marie Antoinettes (“Let them wear Austin Reed!”). I get that it’s easier to spot when a woman is wearing expensive clothes, but singling out women’s wardrobe expenditure while ignoring men seems a tad – oh what is the word? What is it? Sexist.
And let’s talk a little more about expenditure. Because no doubt it’s because my ladybrain is soft and can only cope with things like leather trousers, but I don’t understand the snottiness around money and clothes. Would it have been more acceptable if May had spent that money on home improvements? On a holiday? On taking friends to the opera? Because it’s extremely easy to spend that on any of those things, and I don’t see any of them as more beneficial to the greater good than May’s trousers, or Morgan’s handbag, for that matter. Yet because fashion is seen as frivolous, because it is associated with women, we end up with the situation we have right now, with women forced to apologise for spending their own money on themselves. Well done, Nicky Morgan.
And the third thing to say is, let’s please admit that no one is outraged that May spent so much money on trousers, we’re outraged that she spent any money on literally the ugliest, trousers of all time. These aren’t just leather trousers, which might have had a kind of racy-in-Maidenhead appeal, but LOOSE leather trousers. Leather palazzo trousers, for God’s sake, the most nonsensical garment, like a denim raincoat, or a cashmere bikini. No, it isn’t fair to focus on female politicians’ clothes, as I’ve written in this column before. But, May does not make it easy by wearing clothes that were clearly forged in hell, and then getting all defensive about them.
So who’s to blame? Well, May, clearly, for buying these hellish trousers, and for, allegedly, then being so petty. Who’d have thought a woman could be so loose in her trousers and so tight in her arse? Take a tip from your trousers, Theresa, and loosen up. But Morgan is at least as culpable for having got on her leather high horse and honked on about how much the trousers cost, and how she’s clearly the better person because she weaves her clothes out of the hair of Loughborough peasants, or something. To paraphrase George Michael, sometimes the clothes do not make the Tory MP. But sneering at and squabbling about them does tend to reveal the person beneath.

Mills & Boon is best known for what is euphemistically described as “escapist fiction for women”, a genre it first embraced in the 1930s. The company is reported to account for almost three-quarters of sales of romantic fiction in the UK. In 2008, a Mills & Boon paperback was sold in a UK bookshop on average every 6.6 seconds.
However, far from being universally beloved, Mills & Boon novels have been attacked by the feminist movement over the years for everything from misogyny and reinforcing gender stereotypes to repackaging rape as romance. Titles from the past decade have included The Greek Tycoon’s Unwilling Wife and The Billionaire’s Captive Bride. The recent title A Mistletoe Kiss With the Boss tells the story of a woman whose superior demands a date as a condition of making an investment in her charity. Hardly the stuff of feminist fairytale.
So it might come as something of a surprise to see Mills & Boon apparently trying to stake a claim in the feminist literature market with a new series, called Modern Girl’s Guides. The company describe these as “funny, feisty and feminist” – although the latter claim is arguably undermined by the decision to describe women as “girls” in each title.
It’s clear that the books, while setting out to show a new, modern side to the brand, have a firmly tongue-in-cheek tone, following hot on the heels of recent novelty titles such as the spoof Famous Five and Ladybird guides. They have more in common with Five Go Gluten Free than The Second Sex.
The four short hardbacks are each dedicated to a specific topic, such as relationships, 21st-century life and self-improvement at the office. They consist of short vignettes, most only a sentence or two long, designed to contrast with accompanying vintage photographs. Attempts to tap into the modern feminist zeitgeist are overt – the books are liberally peppered with references to mansplaining, Blurred Lines, feminazis and smashing the patriarchy. But readers will be unsurprised to find the focus is more on poking fun at a concept than unpacking it. “Simone and Rosetta are worried about their biological clocks,” begins one passage. “But they’re more worried about how close they are to killing the next person who reminds them that time is not on their side.”
Other content takes aim at the idiosyncrasies of 21st-century life, with topics ranging from Tinder to Netflix and chill, rather than specifically gendered concerns.
Although each book reads a bit like a series of greetings cards, they generally steer refreshingly clear of the tired sexist tropes we’re used to seeing in such a context. They riff on well-trodden feminist discourse around rejecting unwanted advances, or analysis of the disturbing “pick-up artist” trend. But there are also fairly tired references to eating doughnuts, rejecting “detoxing” and ditching exercise fads as subversive acts of female rebellion.
These books aren’t setting out to redefine modern gender relations and they don’t so much smash the patriarchy as wave an ironic middle finger in its general direction. They are more whimsical stocking-filler material than ideal gift for your feminist friend who wants to stab out her own eyeballs when she hears the word “feisty” being used as a marketing tool.
Online fashion retailer Asos has unveiled plans to hire 1,500 staff at its London headquarters and to double domestic manufacturing of its own-brand clothing.
The company, which employs 2,500 people at the site in Camden, north London, said it expected to spend about £38m on additional specialists in technology, marketing, editorial content and retail as it aims to double sales over the next five years.
It is investing another £40m in building an additional 40,000 sq ft (3,700 sq metres) at its base at the art deco Greater London House, formerly the Carreras cigarette factory, to house the extra workers.
Nick Beighton, the chief executive, said Asos expected to open several more manufacturing facilities in the UK over the next three to four years, in order to double capacity from the two factories which make about 4% of its own-label products at present.
The move is good news for UK fashion manufacturing, which was decimated in the 1990s when work moving abroad but has begun to see a renaissance in recent years amid rising costs in China and increasing demand for high fashion made quickly.
Asos has been investing in training workers in the capital for more than five years at a factory in Haringey, north London, which employs about 100 people, 40 of whom are stitching dresses for Asos, Marks & Spencer and online specialist Finery.
Asos’s UK investment is the latest financial commitment to the UK by a major digital business. It follows significant investment announcements from Facebook and Google, which plan to increase their staff numbers in the UK, despite fears that Brexit would make the country a less attractive place to invest.
Alongside a number of British online retailers, Asos has benefited from the drop in the value of the pound, because almost 60% of its sales are outside the UK.
Asos said the renovation of its HQ would include new staircases and light wells, a health club, training academy and “quiet zone library”, plus a tech bar and concierge service for staff.
Beighton said: “Our people are what make Asos special. We are creating a workspace that fosters creativity, where they can enjoy what they do.”
Asos is one of the companies that have come under scrutiny over working practices at their warehouses in recent months, after the Guardian’s disclosure last year that temporary workers at Sports Direct were being paid less than the minimum wage.
Neil Derrick, the Yorkshire regional secretary of the GMB union which has led protests against conditions at a warehouse near Barnsley which handles distribution for Asos, said: “We welcome the announcement of 1,500 new jobs at Asos but not when GMB’s concerns for the workers in Yorkshire have been completely ignored.
“The company’s growth is on back of workers in their Yorkshire warehouse, yet there seems to be a huge disparity between how Asos staff in London and workers in Yorkshire are treated. Conditions in Barnsley are frankly shocking and have caused the GMB grave concern over the past two years.
“If Asos want to provide ‘fashion with integrity’ as they claim, working with us to make their Yorkshire site a decent place to work would be a start.”
The Football Association has revealed its innovative ideas for attracting more girls into the sport, which include pink whistles, nice-smelling bibs and allowing girls breaks to stop and check their phones.
The plan, hosted on the Sussex FA website, also advises advertising “in places where girls go”, such as “coffee shops or the backs of toilet doors”, and suggests using discount clothes vouchers as an incentive. Possible slogans to attract girls include: “You won’t even notice you’re getting fit!” and “Who needs Facebook friends?” Today’s allegation that reform of English football is being blocked by “elderly white men” perhaps makes the approach on offer here a little less surprising.
While the drive to think about making the sport more accessible to women is welcome, some young female football fans have already made their thoughts on the list clear, writing to let the FA know that “we aren’t all brainless Barbie dolls”.
As the debate continues, how about similar guidelines for helping women and girls get ahead in other tricky, male-dominated areas?
Insert small cosmetic mirrors along the back of each bench in the House of Commons.
Slip a discreet handbag-sized brochure of eligible male MPs into the graduation packs of female politics students.
Encourage even more media coverage of the great shoes female MPs get the chance to wear.
Suggested slogan: “You might be told to ‘Calm down, dear’, but it’s the taking part that counts!”
Launch an all-female office snowboarding trip so the organisation can technically claim higher numbers of “women on boards”.
Suggested slogan: “You’ll be having so much fun you won’t even notice you’re being paid 15% less!”
More competitions about makeup and hairdryers. They’ve worked so well in the past!
Run a blind-date night where each girl has to come as a different element of the periodic table and find an attractive atom to make a compound with.
Free tissues in the lab for when they start crying everywhere.
Suggested slogan: “Science: it’s really just all about perfume!”
Create glittery tools that female engineers can buy for a bargain 150% more than the mainstream versions.
Specifically advertise roles where hairstyle isn’t likely to be affected by working conditions (and similar perks).
Target potential recruits in places where women go, such as Topshop and Bridget Jones’s Baby screenings.
Suggested slogan: “We’re only 9% of the workforce and that’s before we get pushed out by sexism, but by golly our hair looks good!”
Free manicures to be performed by male colleagues during re-entry to Earth’s atmosphere, in preparation for media coverage on landing.
A small but well-stocked shoe shop on board the International Space Station.
Suggested slogan: “There’s no washing-up to do in space!”
Calculator displays that show flowers instead of numbers.
Seat girls next to male students in the classroom so they can easily learn by peeking at the boys’ answers.
More exam questions about working out VAT on chocolate and the rising price of women’s underwear.
Suggested slogan: “It’s as easy as one, two … ooh a pretty flower!”
Raise girls’ aspirations by increasing the breast size of female characters in computer games just a notch more.
Distract attention from sexual harassment at conferences using flashing lights and loud music.
Create some kind of international online mob that can shut down any women who mention sexism in gaming, thus making women feel much safer and attracting them to the industry in hordes.
Suggested slogan: “Equal opportunities means women can be harassed in virtual reality too!”
Of course, increasing funding and media coverage for some of our excellent women’s football teams might arguably be a good way to encourage girls into the sport. But where’s the feminine fun in that?
About a year ago, the performance artist H Plewis began collecting her own menstrual blood. She then mixed it with jelly and let it set into the form of a rabbit. “I thought jelly was a good substance as it reminded me of the plasma in your period,” she says. For Plewis, her own blood had become a piece of art.
“When I first had my period, I didn’t want to tell anybody,” she says, about what inspired her. “I kept it secret for quite a long time until my father found out. So I wanted to turn that shame into something quite visceral and visual. Get close to my blood, feel it and handle it.”
The rabbit will feature in her act in the show Dr Carnesky’s Incredible Bleeding Woman, which premieres tomorrow at the Soho theatre in London. The cabaret show intertwines politics with entertainment; there will be illusions, sword swallowing and hair hanging. And lots of blood.
“It’s up to the audience to figure out which blood is fake and which isn’t,” says Marisa Carnesky, the show’s director. Women are scattered around the chilly basement rehearsal room. Plewis is lying on the floor writing a monologue, lighting designer Nao Nagai is gently rocking a sleeping baby, and performer Molly Beth Morossa is on her way to buy some mugs. All are in the midst of planning and rehearsing the upcoming show.
“We are playing with the idea that menstruating is magic,” says Carnesky. To her, there is more to the idea than mere entertainment value.
The show’s thesis is based on work by the radical anthropologist Chris Knight, who, drawing on the ideas of Friedrich Engels, claims that the transition from primate to human culture was through the discovery of female solidarity. As women supposedly synchronised their menstruations to the 29-day cycle of the moon, men were, in theory, able to go hunting knowing their women wouldn’t be harassed by other men for sex.
“Looking at this research, you can come to the conclusion that the idea of witches came from these events, where women came together on the dark moon to seclude themselves and menstruate,” Carnesky eagerly explains. It’s a theory she’s so passionate about that it has inspired not just her show but also an activist movement, named the Menstronauts. “We recreate menstrual rituals, teaching our bodies to run in tandem with the planets,” she says.
Since the 1970s, many art forms have touched on the subject of menstruation, attempting to subvert societal discomfort with a physiological experience most women have. Coinciding with the women’s liberation movement, pieces such as Judy Chicago’s Red Flag, a photolithograph of a woman’s hand taking a bloodied tampon out of her vagina, provoked both awe and disgust.
The concept of using menstrual blood to create art has gained even more prominence in the past few years. Vanessa Tiegs coined the term “menstrala” in 2000 to describe her paintings that used menstrual blood. She echoes what Carnesky says about the importance of menstrual cycles. The phrase rhymes with “mandala”, which fits well with the idea of menstruation making us whole, she says, hoping that the name will become a way to unify menstrual artists.
For Jen Lewis, a more recent convert to the menstrala movement, it was using a menstrual cup that changed things. “The first time I poured out my menstrual cup, I noticed how the thick fluid interacted with the water. As someone who studied art, I started thinking about Jackson Pollock, so I asked my husband if he could help me photograph it,” she says. The result is an ongoing series of photographs of her period creating bloody shapes in toilet bowls. She calls it Beauty in Blood.
Lewis wants her photographs to be the starting point for people to confront the stigma that has surrounded menstruation for decades. “The female body is leaky; it has breast milk and menstrual fluids. These are all things that are in opposition to the male body,” she says. Our culture’s shame has become profitable, Lewis believes. “The easiest way to sell a product is by making it taboo. It’s easier to pin us to these menstrual management products if we continue to believe that it isn’t normal.”
Menstrala art is often interwoven with activism, which is the case for both Lewis and the Carnesky crew. “Generally, menstrual activism strives to resist menstrual shame, and expand knowledge and care options,” says Chris Bobel, author of New Blood: Third Wave Feminism and the Politics of Menstruation. She believes art is an important medium to initiate change. “Art of this kind provocatively challenges the viewer to assess their assumptions about menstrual taboos. It can upend what is taken for granted, and that’s powerful.”
Bobel also mentions Gloria Steinem’s 70s essay If Men Could Menstruate, where Steinem argues that, if the shoe was on the other foot, men would deem the experience worthy of pride. “Menstruation is a biological process, but its meaning is gendered. And because it’s largely a woman’s experience, it’s devalued,” she says.
Back at the rehearsal space, Carnesky says she believes art and subcultures are key to challenging norms. “As women, we’ve internalised a misogynist culture that has tabooed menstruation and said it is dirty. Reclaiming it is so important because it’s one of the most powerful things the body goes through and we should celebrate that.”
I saw a heap of damp duvet, a suitcase and bit of carpet in some bushes in the park this morning. It has been there for two days now. Somebody’s winter bedroom, probably, but where is that somebody? Impaled on nearby pavement spikes while trying to rest? Or perhaps they were hosed down by security guards while napping in a doorway, got pneumonia and ended up in A&E, or dead. Because where do you go when your clothes are drenched, it’s freezing cold and you have nowhere to dry out and nothing clean and warm to wear?
Will that person ever come back to the park for their suitcase? Last time the police found someone’s bedding and suitcase in our park, a couple of years ago, the wardens saved it all, because they knew whose it was, and that he was at work, still trying to hold down a job. No wonder he chose the park, because where else was he meant to go? And now “defensive architecture” is on the rise across England and Wales: spikes and huge pebbles in doorways and on pavements, or lumpy benches, perches instead of seats in bus shelters, all to stop the homeless from sleeping or resting.
I suppose it’s a bit more subtle than the 18th-century method of getting rid of “vagrants” – summarily whipping or rounding them up and moving them on “from parish to parish”, but it’s still painful and humiliating. What are our homeless people meant to do, if there are no homes for them? Jump off a cliff?
There’s no point trying to bully or hose all this misery out of sight. There’s too much of it. It’s bound to spill on to the pavements. In town, Fielding passed a woman yelling and begging with a dog, and a man sitting shouting at the night, both maddened by circumstances, within yards of each other. Now there are “shock figures” showing that Tory cuts have made social care worse. Shock? Couldn’t anyone see it coming? And this is the festive season of light and love. Just not for anyone living on our city streets.

We all know the pain of a dodgy cut and blow-dry, or the hairdresser who never shuts up (or who never says a word, if that’s your thing). Less known is beauty parlour syndrome – or vertebrobasilar insufficiency – the term for a stroke thought to be caused by getting your hair washed at a salon. Experts believe that the process of tilting the neck backwards over a basin can, on extremely rare occasions, tear the artery, leading to blood clots and strokes.
This is what happened to Dave Tyler, who collapsed in 2011 two days after getting his hair cut at a Brighton salon and has just won £90,000 in compensation. At London’s National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, he was reportedly asked by a consultant if he had had his hair cut recently. Beauty parlour syndrome was coined in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1993 by Dr Michael Weintraub after he saw five women who had developed serious neurological symptoms following shampoos at hair salons. Complaints included severe dizziness, loss of balance and facial numbness. Four out of five suffered strokes.
“I have never heard of it,” admits my Edinburgh hairdresser, Lesley Moses, who has been in the business for 25 years and has been washing and cutting my hair for nearly 10 of those. “I suppose it has to do with your basin: cheaper ones don’t give the right support. Mostly it’s about the consultation with the client. That’s the point where I assess what needs to happen at the basin and beyond.” Has he ever known anyone to get ill or injured after coming to see him? “No,” he says. “I have had the odd client who has made me aware of neck problems, but then we change the washing position.”
Hairdressing remains an unregulated industry and the UK is one of the only countries in the world that does not have a system of compulsory registration. Hairdressers do not need a formal qualification to shampoo hair. Put that together with sharp instruments, high heat and powerful chemicals and the salon starts to look less like an oasis of calm and more like a barbershop of horrors. Examples given by firms specialising in salon injury claims include chemical, electrical and heat burns, allergic reactions and anaphylactic shock, and poor application of chemicals. One spiel begins: “Did you know the peroxide used to bleach your hair in a high-street salon is the same chemical that was used to propel early rockets?”
On extremely rare occasions, effects can be fatal. In 2012, Julie McCabe died a year after she developed a severe allergic reaction to L’Oréal hair dye, fell into a coma and never regained consciousness. At the inquest, the coroner said he believed it was only the second death in the UK resulting from the use of hair dye. The Guardian’s beauty columnist Sali Hughes has also written about being admitted to hospital with a potentially fatal reaction after her hair was dyed at a salon.
“Clients can become allergic to products that they have not been allergic to before,” Moses explains. “All colour clients should have a regular skin or patch test every six months.”

When, just a few weeks before the 2015 general election, the Conservative party announced that it would be introducing 30 hours of so-called free childcare for working parents in England – promptly overshadowing Labour’s own 25-hour pledge – parents rejoiced.
In a country where parents can spend more on childcare than they do on their mortgages, this offer was seen as a lifeline for many families. Unfortunately, the closer we get to the September 2017 rollout of the extended offer, the clearer it becomes that this policy has been rushed through, is ill thought out, and crucially, is massively underfunded.
Earlier this month the government published a disappointing response to the long-awaited consultation on early-years funding. Despite repeated warnings from the early-years sector that the 30-hour offer is not being properly financed, the Department for Education confirmed that it is ploughing ahead with its “ambitious” plans.
What makes this so frustrating is that the problem of early-years underfunding is not new. For years the amount that the government pays providers (nurseries, schools, pre-schools and childminders) to deliver early-years places hasn’t come close to covering the actual cost, meaning that providers lose money on every “free” hour they provide.
As it stands, all three- and four-year-olds, and the most disadvantaged 40% of two-year-olds, in England can receive 15 hours of government-funded early education and childcare a week, but independent research commissioned by the Pre-school Learning Alliance (PLA) in 2014 found that for every five children currently accessing funded places as part of the 15-hour offer, government funding only covers four.
So you can imagine our frustration when, instead of addressing this problem, the government – in a fit of pre-election pledge-making – decided to exacerbate it. A 2015 government review of the cost of delivering childcare places prompted a small increase in average funding rates, but nowhere near enough to plug the funding shortfall. In fact, in its consultation response the government confirmed that 20% of local areas will actually see their early-years funding decrease when the new funding rates come into effect in April 2017.
Worse still, the government has confirmed that these new funding rates – rates that so many have warned are insufficient – will be fixed until 2020, even as national minimum and living wages, mortgages, rents, utilities and other business costs inevitably rise. Last week the government admitted that it has no plans to formally review the costs of delivering childcare and early-years education.
In what world is this an acceptable approach to policymaking, especially for the delivery of a flagship manifesto pledge? The government cannot shut its eyes and hope this problem goes away. Without sufficient funding, we’re likely to see more and more early-years providers restricting the number of funded places they offer, if not opting out of the scheme completely in order to stay in business: and, consequently, more and more parents struggling to find a “free” place for their child.
The simple fact is that the 30-hour offer can only work if government funding actually covers the costs of delivering early-years places, something that the PLA’s Fair Future Funding campaign is calling on the government to ensure. This is not about asking for endless investment. It’s about the government committing itself to properly funding a pledge that it chose to make.
And it’s not about taxpayers paying for other people’s children to be looked after. It’s about investing in quality early education, just as we do for state-funded primary and secondary education.
Either the government can afford to fund this policy properly or it can’t – and if it can’t, it needs to come clean and admit that the childcare it is offering parents isn’t free after all, but merely subsidised.
This is a government that has talked a lot about life chances, about closing the gap and ensuring that all children get the best start in life. And yet, somehow we are in a situation where its childcare policy is falling apart at the seams, children’s centre closures are on the rise, and no one seems to be willing to admit there’s a problem.
If the government is truly committed to supporting children and families, its actions need to start matching its rhetoric.
I know I ought to be sad about the news that climate change may spell the end of the great British fish supper as we know it – that human greed is sounding the death knell for cod stocks in the North Sea is not something to celebrate, and that’s the least of the problems rising sea temperatures will cause.
But, although it is something we should all be seriously worried about (you too, Donald), it’s hard not to feel a small and very selfish pleasure in climate change’s tiny silver lining: while cod are moving north out of UK waters, Mediterranean species such as sardines, anchovies and red mullet are increasingly taking their place. Most excitingly of all, as far as I’m concerned, squid numbers are positively soaring.
The British have always been suspicious of these strange-looking cephalopods, willing to tolerate calamari on holiday but not in our own kitchens. I hope increasing availability will signal a change in attitudes, because squid has the potential to be a real crowd-pleaser if only we’d let it – mild and sweet, when properly cooked it is wonderfully tender with a slightly springy texture (done wrong, of course, it is second cousin to a rubber band).
Cooking squid is blessedly simple because there are only two ways to do it: low and slow, or fast and hot. The first follows the same principles as any braised dish, with the added advantage that squid softens far more quickly than most meat – make a base sauce (soften some onions and garlic, for example, sprinkle in some herbs and splash in a bit of wine and a tin of chopped tomatoes), add the pieces of cleaned squid and simmer very gently for about an hour and a half. Easy, cheap and very delicious.
The second is even quicker – cut the cleaned squid into rings or triangles, lightly score any large pieces to help them cook more quickly, season, and cook in a couple of tablespoons of very hot oil, or on a smoking-hot griddle until they curl up. You can flour them lightly if you’d prefer more of a calamari-like coating; or indeed batter and deep-fry them and serve with chips and mushy peas, with extra tartare for those super crispy tentacles. Suddenly a world where Squids In replaces the Codfather doesn’t sound so bad.
Dreading your work Christmas party this year? You’re not alone. It has been reported that some of us hate office parties so much that we’ll invent a “social sickie” – a convenient minor illness – to get out of them. As a chronic sufferer of social sickies (I’ve managed to dodge all work Christmas parties since 2011), allow me to pass on any and all symptoms of this terrible condition:
1. The first symptoms of a social sickie will often knock you sideways when you receive your invitation to the party. However, they may also strike you down when you’re dressed and at your front door, when you suddenly realise that you’re going to miss something quite good on TV.
2. Social sickies can be brought on by any of the following: a realisation that you’ll be expected to dance, seeing the words “till late” on the invitation, fear of being trapped in a corner by the world’s dullest man like you were last year, or a sudden understanding that you only put up with these bloody people because you’re paid to.
3. If you primarily communicate with your employer in person, your first symptom will involve looking sad and holding your head whenever you meet their eye on the day of the party.
4. If you primarily communicate with your employer by phone, a social sickie will affect your speaking voice on the day of the party.
5. If you primarily communicate with your employer by email, a social sickie will make you type everything in lower case, because that makes it look as if you’re so ill that you can’t hold the shift key down.
6. If you really must go out on the night of your Christmas do – maybe to see a friend in a pub for medical advice – make sure the pub is nowhere near the party venue. Otherwise, you will definitely be spotted.
7. It is important to remember what illness you have, so that you can describe it later. Failure to do so may result in you blurting out: “I fell asleep,” in a panic when your boss asks where you were. As someone who used this excuse for missing the Guardian Christmas party in 2013, I can promise you that this doesn’t work.
8. The day after the Christmas party, expect to receive treatment in the form of nobody even noticing that you didn’t show up. Secretly, this will hurt.
“It’s quite something when you give somebody a box of tampons and they break down in tears.” Nigel Webster, the project manager of the Bestwood and Bulwell food bank in Nottingham, says he has been warning for years about “period poverty” – when women and girls struggle to pay for basic sanitary products on a monthly basis, with significant impact on their hygiene, health and wellbeing.
“I first became aware of it when a middle-aged man asked in embarrassment for his teenage daughter,” Webster recalls. “A young father came in recently asking for maternity pads for his wife who had just given birth. If you’ve got no money to feed yourself then you’ve got no money to wipe your backside either.”
This is the hidden side of poverty, says Webster: struggling to feed your kids, heat your home, but also keep yourself clean. “I remember one woman said: ‘It’s not the hunger that gets us, it’s the lack of basic hygiene.’”
While the demand for women’s sanitary products has been evident to food banks and homeless shelters for some time, the recent focus on the humiliating consequences of period poverty in the Ken Loach film I, Daniel Blake, and by politicians in the Scottish parliament and now Westminster, is bringing menstrual inequality into the open for the first time.
This week campaigners have been joined by a cross-party group of MPs – including Paula Sherriff, the shadow minister for women and equalities, – to press Procter & Gamble, one of the country’s largest manufacturers of sanitary products, to donate a small proportion of its output to homeless shelters across the UK, following anecdotal evidence of women forced to use newspapers, socks and toilet rolls instead.
Sherriff also plans to raise the issue at a meeting with Boots on Wednesday.
Led by the tampon tax champion Laura Coryton, who successfully persuaded the government to scrap VAT on sanitary products in 2015, the lobbying will highlight the Homeless Period project, which aims to increase the donation of sanitary products to homeless shelters.
Coryton is hopeful of a positive outcome, pointing out that P&G already operates a number of similar donation programmes, and has form in adopting proposals that provide poorer families with everyday essentials.
She also believes such campaigns are changing public attitudes towards menstruation. “When I started on the tampon tax campaign, people were so weird about it, and when it was first brought up in parliament no politician wanted to say ‘period’ or ‘tampon’. People are definitely becoming less squeamish,” she says.
The Scottish parliament held its first debate on period poverty in September, tabled by Monica Lennon, Scottish Labour’s inequalities spokesperson, who has championed the issue since her election last May as the MSP for Central Scotland.
“It is an uncomfortable truth that not every woman and girl in Scotland can afford to buy essential feminine hygiene products when they need them,” Lennon told the chamber, detailing evidence from Barnardo’s Scotland, Scottish Women’s Aid and the Trussell Trust, as well as from private conversations with volunteers at food banks, churches and teachers across her constituency.
“What use is a free prescription for period pain relief if low pay and insecure zero-hours contracts are forcing menstruating women to stuff their pants with toilet paper? What difference will the ‘attainment challenge’ make if you are a girl sitting in class with the embarrassment of a saturated sanitary towel between your legs?”
Since September, Lennon has continued to press the SNP government to undertake a comprehensive assessment of the accessibility and affordability of feminine hygiene products, as well as investigating the potential of free provision in the same way that free condoms are offered in a variety of public outlets but tend only to be taken by those most in need.
Lennon’s campaign has attracted the support of Paul Laverty, the screenwriter of I, Daniel Blake, who told the Guardian about the inspiration for the scene in the film in which the female protagonist is caught shoplifting tampons. “It started off with one young woman who told me that she had been sanctioned on several occasions and that she stole some stuff and the shame that she felt, but she was desperate and isolated.”
Lennon has also enjoyed cross-party support: indeed, SNP MPs and MSPs have proposed a similar scheme called the S Card, which could be handed to a local pharmacy, doctor, or nurse in exchange for a pack containing a monthly supply of sanitary products.
Ewan Gurr, the Scotland development officer for the Trussell Trust, believes the Scottish government is willing to tackle period poverty, although inevitably questions of funding – in particular in relation to newly devolved welfare powers – come into play.
Since the Holyrood debate on the subject, Gurr has met the Scottish health minister, Aileen Campbell, who stressed the need for more empirical work to be done. He now plans to work with other women’s organisations to build a research base over the coming six months.
“My sense is that there is an openness from the Scottish government, but they have to have evidence to back it up,” says Gurr. “This issue is beginning to build traction. Ken [Loach] and Paul [Laverty] captured an experience that has been going on in food banks for many years and prompted public outrage. We need to build on that now with research and action.”
While multinational donation schemes and universal government schemes require longer-term pressure, local services are piloting their own imaginative solutions.
On the Whitehawk estate in Brighton, food bank staff became aware of an urgent need for sanitary products, in particular among younger women.
“Younger women were coming in surviving on one tampon a day, with all the health implications that involves,” explains Kate Tennant, a coordinator. “It results in bullying and in not smelling so great. Young girls are living in homes where often the mother or carer is not available to offer help with periods, so youth leaders are also giving out information.”
After persuading a female trustee of the food bank to give funding for sanitary products, Tennant now runs a scheme called Monthlies. Mostly younger women are given a card that is marked off every month in exchange for a pack containing a box of tampons, day and night-time towels, deodorant, wipes and a bar of chocolate.
Tennant believes that ultimately the Department for Work and Pensions should fund GPs and health centres to distribute sanitary products to those in need, in the same manner that those on benefits are exempt from prescription charges in England and Wales. “Most people wouldn’t expect it to be an issue, but then you wouldn’t think food poverty was an issue.”
In terms of government intervention, be that Scottish or Westminster, Nigel Webster is circumspect: “We’d welcome anything that helps but we’re the sticking plaster and we need to sort out the underlying causes of low pay, zero-hours contracts and so on. Let’s not make it easy for food banks to give out free sanitary products but close them down.”
Christmas always creeps up on me. I’m never quite sure how, because talk of where we will spend it start as soon as the summer ends. This year we are heading to Anglesey, the beautiful little island off the coast of north Wales where we got married last summer. Christmas dinner is almost always my domain. It has become less conventional in recent years; we are a family of vegetarians and vegans, and this year my one-year-old, Dylan, will have his first proper Christmas meal. My task is to make something that will unite us all around the table.
I always make two main dishes. This year it will be a celeriac and sweet garlic pie, which is everything I want in such a dish: flaky, cheese-spiked pastry, a lavish filling with loads of flavour, and a crisp-textured top to crown it. I will also make my Christmas galette for the vegans. The trimmings change each year, and this time I’m going for golden crusted roast sprouts, harissa and miso roast squash, all topped with a vegetarian gravy that everyone will be fighting over. The feast starts with a pickled squash, charred clementine and radicchio salad. It needs to be started the night before, but it’s well worth the effort. It’s just the thing to get tastebuds and conversations going. We’ll end with a gingerbread and cranberry tart that’s lighter than the usual Christmas offering and, I promise, all the better for it.
1 Peel and slice the squash as thinly as possible and put the slices in a large mixing bowl. Warm the vinegar in a pan with the spices, rosemary, salt and pepper until just before it comes to a boil, then pour over the squash and leave overnight.
2 On the day, set the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Put the feta on to a baking tray with a spoonful of the vinegar and spice mixture and the zest of a clementine, and roast for 40 minutes, until burnished on top.
3 Make the dressing by mixing together the balsamic, oil and lime with 3 tbsp of water until thick, then add the maple syrup and mix again.
4 Heat a griddle pan. Cut the radicchio into wedges, peel the clementines and cut them in half across the middle. Once the griddle is smoking hot, put the clementines on their flat side until they are nicely charred then set aside. Next griddle/fry the squash on both sides – you may need to do this in batches. Then griddle the radicchio on both of its flat sides.
5 Once everything is griddled, lay the clementines, radicchio and squash on a big platter and drizzle generously with the dressing. Serve just warm with good warm toast if you like.
With its cheddar and winter herb pastry, this high-sided pie takes a little time, but at Christmas I think that’s OK.
Serves 8-10
For the pastry
250g plain white spelt flour
125g butter, cold, cubed
½ tsp fine sea salt
A few sprigs of rosemary, thyme and sage, leaves picked and finely chopped
Zest of 1 lemon
25g good cheddar, grated
1 egg yolk
50-70ml cold water
For the filling
3 medium heads garlic, cloves separated and peeled
1 tbsp olive oil, plus a little extra to finish
1 tsp balsamic vinegar
1 tbsp honey
2 sprigs of rosemary, thyme and sage, leaves picked and finely chopped
1kg celeriac
220g crumbled Lancashire or good cheddar cheese
150g creme fraiche
Juice of ½ lemon
1 tbsp wholegrain mustard
A small bunch of parsley, chopped
2 eggs, beaten
A few splashes of Worcestershire sauce (I use a vegetarian one)
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 Put the flour in a mixing bowl. Add the cubed butter and the salt. Rub gently with your fingertips until it is like fine breadcrumbs. Stir through the herbs, lemon zest and grated cheddar.
2 Beat the egg yolk with 1 tbsp of cold water. Add to the flour and mix until it forms a dough. Add water a teaspoon at a time if needed tsp by tsp until it comes together into a smooth dough. Wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge while you make the filling.
3 For the filling, put the cloves of garlic into a saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook for 2-3 minutes, then drain.
4 Wipe the saucepan dry. Add the garlic and olive oil and fry on a high heat for 2 minutes. Add the balsamic vinegar and 200ml water, bring to the boil and simmer gently for 10 minutes.
5 Add the honey, most of the rosemary and thyme (reserving the rest, with the sage) and a good pinch of salt. Continue to cook on a medium heat for a further 5 minutes, or until most of the liquid has evaporated and the garlic cloves are coated in a dark syrup.
6 Meanwhile, peel the celeriac and cut it into quarters. Set aside 300g and slice the rest into 2cm-thick pieces. Put them into a saucepan, cover with hot water and boil for 7-10 minutes.
7 Drain and tip into a big mixing bowl. Add the cheese, creme fraiche, lemon juice, mustard, parsley and eggs. Add a good pinch of salt and grind of pepper and gently fold in the garlic cloves.
8 Preheat the oven to 160C/325F/gas mark 3. Sprinkle flour on to a work surface and roll out the pastry to 3-4mm thick. Line a 20cm-diameter cake tin with the pastry, ensuring a little spills over the edges.
9 Add the filling. Grate the reserved celeriac and pile it on top. Finish with the reserved rosemary and thyme, all the sage, and a drizzle of olive oil. Bake for 45 minutes or until the tart filling has set and the top is golden brown.
10 Remove from the oven, leave to cool a little, then take it out of the tin. Lay a few herbs on top and serve warm.
Serves 8
2 leeks
2 red onions
2 sticks of celery
4 carrots
2 garlic cloves in their skins
2 sprigs of rosemary, bay and thyme
Salt and black pepper
Olive oil
2 tbsp flour
500ml dry cider
1 litre vegetable stock
1 Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Roughly chop the vegetables and put them into a large baking tray with the herbs. Season, drizzle over a little olive oil, and roast for 45 minutes or until sweet, soft and golden.
2 Remove the vegetables from the oven, allow to cool a little and use a potato masher to mash them all up.
3 Put the tray of mashed vegetables on the hob. Add the flour and stir it in for a couple of minutes. Add the cider and the stock and bring to a simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to mix in all the good sticky bits from the tray.
4 Sieve the gravy and keep in the fridge until needed. Reheat with a little extra hot water or vegetable stock.
This recipe saves a lot of work, as squash, potatoes and greens can be cooked together in one tray. The chilli, miso and lemon combo is a great foil for some of the richer seasonal dishes.
Serves 8
500g small potatoes, scrubbed clean
700g butternut or other squash
4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
3 tbsp white miso
2 tbsp harissa
Juice of 1 lemon
100g kale, de-stemmed and shredded
100g toasted almonds
1 Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Cut the potatoes into halves or quarters no larger than your thumb.
2 Cut the squash in half lengthways (no need to peel), use a spoon to scoop out the seeds, then cut into 2cm slices.
3 In a small bowl mix together the olive oil, miso, harissa and lemon juice.
4 Put the potatoes and squash on to a baking tray with half the harissa mixture. Toss well, using your hands, to make sure everything is coated. Roast for 40-45 minutes until everything is cooked through and browning at the edges. Turn everything once or twice to make sure it browns evenly, and keep a close eye on it as it can burn in a flash.
5 Add the shredded kale and roast for a final 10 minutes. It should crisp up a little. Transfer to a serving dish and spoon over the remaining dressing and scatter with the toasted almonds.
This dish has had many devoted sprout haters reaching for a second helping.
1 Set the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Heat the vinegar and spices in a pan until warm, but don’t boil.
2 Trim the stems of the sprouts, remove any raggedy outer leaves, and cut each in half. Put them into a bowl and pour the hot pickling liquid over. Leave to sit for at least 1 hour and up to 4. Drain the sprouts, discarding the pickling liquid, and put them in a bowl with a glug of olive oil and a couple of pinches of salt.
3 Heat a large heavy baking tray on the hob, add a little more olive oil, then put the sprouts into the tray, ideally cut-side down, but no need to be too precious. Cook on the hob for a minute or two to start the browning. Cover the tray with foil, transfer to the oven and roast for 10 minutes.
4 Remove from the oven, turn the sprouts over with a spatula and put them back for a further 10 minutes. They are ready when they are tender inside, and crisp and golden on the outside. Finish with a few grinds of pepper and a dusting of grated gruyere.
This tart is lighter than a lot of Christmas desserts – after a big, rich meal I don’t want a heavy, stodgy pudding. I serve it with coconut yoghurt whipped up with some vanilla seeds so my whole family can eat it, but it would be equally good with cream or custard.
Serves 8-10
For the oat and pecan crust
140g rolled oats
60g pecans, chopped
90g runny honey or blackstrap molasses
100g coconut oil or melted butter
Seeds from 1 vanilla pod
1½ tsp ground ginger
½ tsp ground cinnamon
A pinch of ground cloves
A good pinch of salt
75g wholemeal flour
For the cranberry filling
2 pears, peeled and sliced thinly
2 tbsp chia seeds
100ml apple juice or water
300g fresh cranberries
100g light brown sugar or coconut sugar
60g coconut oil, melted
Seeds from 1 vanilla pod
½ tsp ground cinnamon
¼ tsp ground cardamom
1 clementine, zest only
1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Put all of the crust ingredients in a food processor and pulse to mix.
2 Grease a 24cm loose-bottomed tart tin with a little coconut oil and press the crust mix evenly into the bottom. There’s no need to push it up the sides. Put the pear slices in a single layer on top of the crust.
3 Combine the chia seeds with 100ml of apple juice or water and set aside until they come together to form a gel.
4 Mix the cranberries with the remaining ingredients, stir until well combined, then add the chia mixture. Pour the cranberry filling on top of the crust and pear layer and spread evenly. Bake for 35-45 minutes.
5 Allow the tart to cool completely before removing it from the tin. Serve with coconut yoghurt or whipped cream.
For many healthcare professionals, working over Christmas is a given. The thought of working at this time of year can be galling for many but, as Dr Jenny Hughes wrote, it can be the most uplifting time to work.
Teams of staff can pull together and bond over boxes of chocolates on the ward and canteen Christmas dinners. And the odd Christmas miracle may happen, be it the birth of a baby, saving someone’s life or even just being there to listen.
Are you a healthcare professional who has worked at Christmas? We want to hear about it. What have been your memorable moments? What’s the atmosphere like? How did you feel working over the festive season? Have you witnessed or been part of any Christmas miracles?
Please fill in the form below and tell us your experiences of working at Christmas. A selection of responses will be used in our reporting. You can remain anonymous if you wish.
Recently, evidence emerged that the sugar industry had paid scientists in the 1960s to implicate saturated fat, and not sugar, as a cause for heart disease. While the revelations are stunning, food industry funding of nutrition research is more common than consumers may realize.
New York University nutrition professor Marion Nestle began informally tracking studies funded by food and beverage companies, as well as trade groups, in 2015. Her research uncovered 168 such studies in that year alone, and of those, 156 showed biased results that favored the sponsor’s interests, she told the Guardian.
Other research has come to similar conclusions. A 2007 review of 206 studies that looked at the health benefits of milk, soda and fruit juices found that those sponsored entirely by a food or beverage company were four to eight times more likely to show positive health effects from consuming those products.
“Is it really true that food companies deliberately set out to manipulate research in their favor? Yes it is, and the practice continues,” wrote Nestle in a commentary that accompanied the new report criticizing the sugar industry.
The issue is complicated, she said. Companies don’t pay researchers to come to a favorable conclusion. In fact, researchers don’t think industry funding influences results, but evidence suggests otherwise, she added.
“Researchers who take food industry funding do not believe that it affects their study design or interpretation and are outraged at the suggestion,” Nestle said. “Research, however, shows strong correlations between funding and research outcome.”
Here are just a few examples of food and beverage companies footing the bill for research that could be spun into pseudoscience-based PR.
One of the most high profile examples of corporate meddling was the revelation last year that Coca-Cola had paid scientists to push the message that exercise was a more effective weight loss tool than cutting down on food and drink. The beverage giant went so far as to create a nonprofit called the Global Energy Balance Network to push the message that Americans spend too much time focusing on cutting calories, and not enough time exercising. Following an investigation by the New York Times, the nonprofit announced it was disbanding. In a bid to be more transparent, Coca-Cola revealed it had spent $132.8m on scientific research and partnerships between 2010 and 2015.
Earlier this year, the US Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by another beverage company, POM Wonderful, that health claims made in its advertisements misled consumers. The company had paid $35m for studies that showed drinking POM Wonderful pomegranate juice and taking POMx supplements could treat, prevent or reduce the risk of heart disease, prostate cancer and erectile dysfunction. A lower court ruled that its methodology wasn’t rigorous enough, and that ads containing claims such as, “Amaze your cardiologist” and “The antioxidant superpower” were disingenuous.
Monsanto and other ag-biotech companies have recruited academics, and paid them in the form of grants and trips to publicly defend the safety of herbicides used on genetically engineered crops, according to private emails uncovered by nonprofit US Right To Know. In some cases, industry advisors even provided scripted answers to academics to answers such as “Do GMOs cause cancer?” According to an investigation into the emails by the New York Times, the biotech industry has published “dozens of articles” under the names of respected scientists, some of which were drafted by PR consultants. Kevin Folta, chairman at the horticulture sciences department at the University of Florida, wrote in one email to a Monsanto executive: “I am grateful for this opportunity and promise a solid return on the investment.”
PepsiCo, owner of Quaker Oats, commissioned a study in 2011 to test whether Quaker hot oatmeal and its cold cereal Quaker Oatmeal Squares were more filling than Honey Nut Cheerios, a rival. The report found that the oatmeal kept the study’s 48 participants fuller for longer than the Cheerios did, but results were mixed for Quaker’s cold cereal. PepsiCo chose only to publish the results about its hot oatmeal, omitting mention about the cold cereal. According to the Associated Press, the company said the cold cereal results weren’t “significant enough to warrant publication”.
This 2015 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition looked at just 14 overweight postmenopausal women over a period of two weeks to examine the effect of high-fat cheese and high-fat meat on cholesterol. It found that diets with meat and cheese as the primary source of saturated fat caused higher levels of HDL, or so-called “good” cholesterol compared to a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. The study was fully funded by the dairy industry, including the Dairy Research Institute and the Danish Dairy Research Foundation. The study was criticized in a letter to the editor of the journal that noted the “experimental diets were apparently designed so that the possibly desired conclusion could be drawn”.
A 2011 study found that children who eat sweets tend to weigh less than those who don’t. The problem: the research was funded by the National Confectioner’s Association, a trade group representing manufacturers of well known candies such as Snickers bars, Tootsie Rolls and Skittles. The study was also based on a survey that asked participants what they had eaten over the past 24 hours, and the authors noted in the report that the results prove cause and effect. According to the Associated Press, which conducted an investigation into the claims, one of the scientists wrote to her co-author in 2011: “We’re hoping they can do something with it – it’s thin and clearly padded.”
Every so often, results aren’t in the funder’s interests. As reported by Nestle, the National Honey Board funded a study, in collaboration with the US Department of Agriculture, to test whether honey had less of an effect on blood sugar levels than white cane sugar or high fructose corn syrup. But study participants showed similar blood sugar levels after consuming each of the three sweeteners, leading the authors to conclude that eating less sugar was preferable to trying to find a sugar that is “more neutral in terms of its health effects”.
Christmas looms. Yes, it’s still a little way off, but it always helps to remember what’s needed. Have you decided who will be with who on the day? Are you glooming already about the presents? Well, my son had an alternative suggestion for the family last year: instead of us all having to find gifts for five people, he teamed each of us with one other to give to. It sounds a bit organised, but it worked very well.
Have you remembered that Aunt J only drinks tea or sherry, so just offering wine won’t do? If you’ve got a family habit, it helps to remember it even if you’ve decided not to do it this year. I heard way back of a family of seaside farmers who ate their festive meal on the beach; another of parents who were so keen to get it right about Father Christmas for the kiddiwinks that they broke a window (well at least they didn’t try to come down a chimney).
Probably the only thing you’d really regret is leaving people out: you can just about stand anybody if it’s only for a few hours or even days. Where I live is opposite a church, so though only a few of the street are serious Church of England, we all like to go to the carols and the charity sales and each other’s Christmas parties. And, as one of my relations used to say, playing on blood being thicker than water: “You have to be nice to family – the bloody ones come first.”
When I spent Christmas in Finland years ago I admired the way they would sing to the gravestones of their relations so they wouldn’t be left out. And the Australian who shares my house at the moment is going back to Sydney, where they eat seafood for their seasonal meal. Christmas is much as you make it – if you plan it.

When Canada pledged to take 25,000 refugees fleeing war in the Middle East, one restaurateur in Toronto opened his doors, giving a group of Syrian women the opportunity to cook for the community, spread the wealth of their home country’s cuisines – and find new purpose in a strange city
Geoffrey Szuszkiewicz told his family he didn’t want anything for Christmas. But when he opened his stocking to find a roll of duct tape, some cling film and tin foil, he relented. “I was ecstatic. I could use everything,” he says
The 33-year-old dancer from Canada was in the middle of a “buy nothing” year when he opened his present, and had managed to cut out spending on anything except a pre-defined list of basic groceries and necessities for 12 months.
Szuszkiewicz is part of an anti-consumerist movement, known as minimalism or mindful consumerism, that has been sweeping across the globe via blogs, self-help books and social media. This move towards buying less often attracts new converts during the festive season when people balk at the scale of Christmas spending.
According to the Nationwide building society, people on average spend roughly half their monthly pay on Christmas. One in three, meanwhile, pay for Christmas using a credit card or overdraft.
Mark Boyle bought a smallholding in the west of Ireland with the proceeds of his book, The Moneyless Man, after spending three years living entirely without money. “I generally don’t spend anything at all at Christmas now – and I’m much, much happier,” he says.
“I didn’t buy or spend anything for those years – I’d grow or forage my food. Now I let people come and stay for free in my home, and run a moneyless pub. At Christmas, everyone from round here brings a bottle and we get together and have a shindig. For me, that’s what Christmas is about – meeting up and sharing food and drink. I avoid shopping at this time of the year in any way I can.”
Also among those who have embraced the more frugal lifestyle is financial journalist Michelle McGagh, who has been blogging about her “no-spend” year, and detailing the challenges and benefits of her new lifestyle. The savings she made helped her to pay off a substantial chunk of her mortgage. Last Christmas she spent just £14.53 on a meal for six people, did a “presents amnesty” with the adults in her family and made toy cars to give as gifts to her nephews.
Similarly, this Christmas will see Boyle make a few useful gifts for close friends and family out of wood, but he has stopped buying gifts completely and never receives any shop-bought presents. “There isn’t anything I need, even though I am supposedly living below the poverty line,” he says.
Like many minimalists he now values time over money. “I think the best gift you can give someone is time, when you are genuinely fully present. Step off the treadmill of rushing around earning money to pay for stuff and you find life goes much slower. I have so much more time now to do the things I love doing – and not just at Christmas, but all year-round. I feel liberated,” Boyle says.
Szuszkiewicz feels the same way. “You experience this huge release and liberation from cultural norms when you stop spending, especially at Christmas. I used to feel obligated to spend money I didn’t have on gifts I didn’t know whether my family needed or wanted. Now, everyone knows my policy is to not buy any gifts, so I no longer feel that obligation and I enjoy Christmas much more,” he said.
He is generous with his time instead, and during his “buy nothing” year made batches of chocolate, dried fruit and pickled vegetables which he gave to friends and family. “Consumables are great because they get eaten – and then they’re gone.”
Szuszkiewicz is currently using the £24,000 he saved over his no-spend year to travel around the world, and owns no possessions other than those he carries in his backpack. But he doesn’t want anything for Christmas.
“Physical things are literally a burden for me – and that’s not what Christmas means to me anymore. It’s about being with the people I love.”
He acknowledges that he makes a choice not to spend, rather than being forced into that position by circumstance. “But I think there’s nothing wrong with living this way, if you do have a choice. Why should you buy stuff that you don’t need to buy, just because you have more money to spend than other people?”
For people with children, the idea of an abstemious festive season might prove difficult. However, Sarah Koontz, a Christian writer from South Dakota who has two young children, says it teaches willpower. “Completing two no-spend Christmases taught me that it is OK to accept a gift from someone knowing that I cannot reciprocate, or that I’ve spent far less on them. Everyone is entitled to their own gift-giving strategy, and comparison is a trap I prefer to avoid,” she says.
She says that she has been called stingy – or even Scrooge – from time to time, but her convictions carried her through. “Our family is able to enjoy the traditions of Christmas more now that we have eliminated consumerism from the holiday. We still exchange small gifts, many of them homemade, but we have learned that true generosity requires more than a credit card. Spending less money on Christmas forced us to be generous with our time, energy, and talents. Those are the best gifts of all – because they are priceless.”
She is not alone in feeling this way. Sal Crosland, a 33-year-old holistic therapist from Huddersfield, writes the minimalist blog OneEmptyShelf.com. She has got rid of everything in her home she doesn’t need, and now focuses on giving experiences and making memories with her loved ones at Christmas.
“When I was doing my no-spend year and I thought back to past Christmases, I realised I couldn’t remember what I got, but I could remember where I was and who I was with,” she says. “Now, instead of stressing about buying presents, I place more importance on relaxation and family time and I look forward to Christmas much more.”
She always asks her family not to buy her anything for Christmas, and even when other people are given gifts in front of her she says she doesn’t feel like she is missing out. “I know it is my choice and my decision to opt out – and that makes all the difference.”
The act of cutting back on giving gifts at Christmas can be catching. Canadian blogger Cait Flanders went on a two-year-long shopping ban to try to pay off a Can$30,000 debt (£18,000), and in solidarity her family stopped exchanging gifts on Christmas Day. This year, even though the ban is over and the debt repaid, they have decided not to exchange gifts again. “It took so much pressure off everyone, and resulted in a much more meaningful holiday.”
Now she says that she would prefer to give someone a random gift on any other day of the year. “I hate feeling like I need to give gifts out of obligation.”
Regina Wong, founder of the Live Well With Less website, has similar motivations for reducing her spending at Christmas this year. “I have become uncomfortable with the highly commercial nature of Christmas and the general pressure and expectations of the season. I’m not against consumption – I’m just against mindless consumption, and consumption one can’t afford. I’ve realised I already have all I want or need.”
■ Tell people in advance that you won’t be buying gifts. “When I explained why I wasn’t spending at Christmas, the general reaction was relief,” Geoffrey Szuszkiewicz says. “People respected and understood my decision. If anyone doesn’t understand your reasons for cutting back, and still wants you to buy them something, I would recommend re-evaluating that relationship.”
■ Don’t underestimate your skills or the value of a homemade gift, says Mark Boyle, especially one that celebrates what you think is wonderful about the person you are giving it to. “Every single person alive has got some sort of skill or hobby they can use to give someone a gift or an experience. And I think there’s a lot more heart and soul in something you make yourself for another person, especially if it is something unique and distinctive that you think that particular person will like and need.”
■Remember that your presence can be a present too. “A kid might want a computer at Christmas - but is that going to be the deepest longing of that kid’s heart?” Boyle says. “At another level, perhaps without even knowing how to articulate it, what that kid may really want is a deeper connection to his or her parents through quality time. Try to understand the person you are giving to, and what they long for, instead of feeding an addiction to consumerism.”
I was pondering the issue, the other day, of what’s worth spending money on when it comes to running. The purists (or inverse snobs) will tell you that all you need is a pair of cheap plimsolls and the outdoors, and you are good to go. Fair enough if you can run in those things - I couldn’t even do PE at school in them. My personal view is that when it comes to kit, it’s worth spending money on the things that are right for you. If you are lucky enough that Decathlon shoes work for you, brilliant. If, unfortunately for your wallet, it’s only a £100+ pair that make your feet happy, then that’s money well spent. Other stuff can help: a comfy run-commute bag. A Garmin to track your pace. A windproof winter jacket. None of these are essential, but all can help make your running more pleasurable and thus more likely to be repeated.
However, if there is one thing that I would happily spend a fortune on, it would be a good sports massage. When I win the lottery (a matter of time, obviously) I’ll be employing a full time masseur. I would tell you his name but I’m afraid one of you might win first and poach him. Until I had a really good massage, I never quite saw the point. Sure, it could help ease tight knots of muscle, but wouldn’t a foam roller do that? And was it really worth spending that much on when I wasn’t actually injured? The answer is definitely yes. A really good masseur can not only help you recover and indeed prevent injuries, but make you feel like you’ve been gifted a fresh pair of legs. And that, for any committed runner, is priceless.
So, over to you. How was your weekend running? Who has PBs to report? And could someone just give me next week’s winning lottery numbers?
You can have the turkey. Just give me the gravy. And I’ll have the chipolatas and bacon rolls too, the cranberry sauce and the stuffing. At Christmas dinner, it is the accompaniments that interest me as much as, or even more than, the big bird. The chewy, scrunchy savoury bits that are traditionally part of the feast can be sublime either on the side or served as dish in their own right.
The Christmas accompaniments can be served in the classic manner or can be touched by a little imagination – either way, they are my favourite bits. This year, instead of chipolatas, I am going for something that could just as easily be a meal in itself – a ring of Cumberland sausage wrapped in pancetta and sweet date molasses.
Likewise the sprouts, which this year I am roasting, with thyme and garlic. But I am concentrating most of my energies on the gravy itself, the essential ingredient that brings the entire carnival of a meal together. As well as utilising the turkey giblets, I am using a handful of chicken wings to give this crucial part of the dinner a silky, glossy finish. And I’m taking my time too. Side dishes these may be, but for me, they are what really turns Christmas dinner into a feast.
Nothing improves Christmas dinner more than a thoughtfully made gravy. It brings the meal together. A good one, deeply favoured, sweet and mellow, takes time, so I suggest you make it in advance. It improves overnight.
Enough for a medium-sized turkey
onion 1 large
olive oil 5 tbsp
banana shallots 6
whole chicken wings 14
turkey giblets
carrots 4 small
celery 2 ribs
garlic ½ a small head
bay leaves 4
black peppercorns 12
dried mushrooms 20g
thyme 8 sprigs
water 1 litre
redcurrant jelly 2 heaped tbsp
dry marsala or madeira 3 tbsp
Peel the onion, halve it, then slice each half into thin segments. Warm three tablespoons of the olive oil in a deep pan, add the onion, then leave to cook over a low heat, stirring regularly. Let the onion cook till it is sweet, golden brown and very, very soft. A good 20 minutes.
Peel and halve the shallots. Warm the remaining oil in a shallow pan and fry them for five minutes or so till nicely browned. Remove the shallots then add the chicken wings to the pan and let them brown, introducing the giblets towards the end.
Scrub the carrots and slice them in half. Roughly chop the celery then add to the onions together with the shallots, the wings and giblets, the bay, peppercorns, dried mushrooms, thyme and water. Bring to the boil then lower the heat so the liquid simmers gently, then leave for 2 hours. Check regularly to make sure the gravy isn’t boiling.
Strain the gravy through a sieve or colander then bring to the boil in a saucepan, stirring in the redcurrant jelly and marsala or madeira. Check the seasoning, adding salt as necessary, then serve, piping hot, with your Christmas dinner.
It is essential to turn the brussels sprouts over several times in the butter and oil as they roast, as you don’t want them to dry out. Should you prefer to boil them, do so, then warm the butter with the crushed smoked garlic and thyme leaves, stir in the honey then toss with the cooked and drained sprouts.
Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Peel the parsnips and cook them in boiling, lightly salted water for 15-20 minutes or until soft enough to mash. Trim and halve the brussels sprouts and put them into a bowl together with the oil, butter, the peeled garlic and thyme, toss everything together then tip into a roasting tin. Bake for 35 minutes, till golden brown and soft, tossing the sprouts once or twice as they roast.
Drain and mash the parsnips, add the butter and cream and beat till smooth. Pile onto a serving dish. Remove the sprouts and garlic from the oven, trickle over the honey, toss gently then spoon onto the parsnip puree.
Salt not only delivers a deliciously crisp crust, but the smoked salt adds its own flavour to the potatoes too. Give me a plate of these this Christmas, and the garlicky cheese dip beside them, and I’ll be just fine, thank you.
Mix the smoked and natural sea salt flakes then tip them into a roasting tin. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6.
Chop the thyme leaves then toss them with the salts. Wash the potatoes thoroughly, then, while they are still wet, roll them in the thyme salt, pressing down so the salt adheres to their skins. Set them well apart in the roasting tin, on the bed of salt.
Tuck the whole thyme sprigs and cloves of garlic, unpeeled, among the potatoes and bake in the preheated oven for an hour, till the potatoes are crunchy outside, soft and fluffy within.
Warm the goats’ curd in a small saucepan, crumble in the blue cheese. Remove the garlic from the oven, slice each clove open and squeeze the soft, sweet flesh within into the cheese. As the blue cheese starts to melt give it a quick stir, then pour it into a small, warm bowl.
Remove the potatoes from the oven and wipe off most of the salt, it has done its job. Split the potatoes open, then serve with the cheese and garlic dip.
Plump balls of stuffing made with minced turkey. You can get lardo, the silky white fat that is such a treat served on rough toast with a trickle of olive oil and some crumbled rosemary, from a good Italian grocers. Buy it in a block so you can grate it. Failing that, buy it in thin slices and chop it finely.
For the sauce
cranberry sauce or jelly 3 heaped tbsp
orange juice 50ml
orange zest 2 tsp
cranberries 100g, fresh or frozen
Toast the fennel seeds for a couple of minutes in a dry frying pan, then tip them into a large mixing bowl. Put the turkey mince, chilli and breadcrumbs into the bowl then coarsely grate in the lardo. Season generously with both salt and black pepper then mix thoroughly.
Shape the stuffing mixture into 8 large balls, place them on a tray and refrigerate for 25 minutes. Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4.
To make the sauce, put the cranberry jelly or sauce into a small saucepan and place over a moderate heat, add the orange juice and zest and the cranberries and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat so the mixture simmers gently and leave for five or six minutes until the berries have softened a little. You should be able to squash them easily between thumb and forefinger. Remove from the heat and leave to settle.
Warm the olive oil in a shallow pan, then fry the stuffing balls moving them round as each side browns, until they are golden brown all over. Transfer the balls to a baking dish, sitting them snugly together, then spoon over the cranberry sauce. Bake for 30 minutes.
Sticky, sweet-sour date molasses is available from most large supermarkets and any Middle Eastern grocer.
Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Place the Cumberland sausage on a baking sheet lined with foil or baking parchment. Split the dates in half and remove their stones. Wrap the pancetta rashers around the sausage, tucking a couple of the bay leaves, sage leaves and most of the halved dates under as you go. Once the pancetta is in place, tuck some of the juniper berries underneath. Scatter the rest of the bay and juniper berries on top, then bake for 25 minutes till nicely browned. Remove from the oven then baste all over with the date molasses and return to the oven for a further 20 minutes or until glossy and sizzling.
It is thanks to Charles Dickens that when we think of gruel, we picture an almost comically horrible dish: thin and meagre, only a miser like Ebenezer Scrooge would keep a small pan of it warming on his hob at Christmas time, and only a starving child like Oliver Twist would ever long for more of it. But it wasn’t necessarily so. The rich gruel – “a wholesome spoon-meat” – for which there is a recipe in Mary Kettilby’s vividly titled Collection Of Above Three Hundred Receipts in Cookery, Physick and Surgery of 1714 sounds delicious, made as it is from slowly simmered pearl barley, currants, egg yolks, sherry, cream and lemon rind. Can’t you just see it chalked up on some modish restaurant blackboard? Punters! Forget snail porridge. Gruel is where it’s at now.
I got to thinking about gruel one freezing afternoon earlier this month, when I called in at the Foundling Museum in Bloomsbury. Feeding the 400, its latest exhibition, looks at how children in the care of the Foundling Hospital (which stood on the site of the museum) were fed from 1740, a year after Thomas Coram established it, until 1954, when the last pupils were placed in foster care – and yes, it is a chastening experience, especially when we are all about to eat even more than usual. In the end, though, the visitor is moved (almost to tears, in my case) not by how badly the children were fed, but by how well. Although Mary Kettilby’s gruel, the recipe for which I found in the exhibition guide, would have been strictly the province of the hospital’s governors, this isn’t to say that its pupils went without. At their long dining tables, where (put all thoughts of wooden trenchers from your mind) the food was served only on china plates, frugality meant simplicity, not deprivation.
In perfect copperplate – everything was obsessively documented at the Foundling Hospital – there it all is: not only the variety of the foods the children were given, but the fervent desire of its stewards that these things might do them good. Until the beginning of the 20th century, the foundlings were indeed unfailingly fed gruel for breakfast every day. But it was always made with full-fat milk from the dairy cows of Hackney, Islington and Mile End, and served with hunks of bread, which on Sundays came with 15g of butter per child. Breakfast, like every meal, was a serious business, and not only because it began with grace and was taken in silence. In 1811, when it was discovered that, thanks to some fraud carried out by a member of staff, the children had been consuming skimmed milk, it was considered a scandal. Heads had to roll.
My favourite parts of the exhibition belonged to the 20th century, when the suet pies and boiled brisket served in Victorian times began to be replaced with roast veal and cold gammon – and when treats started coming the children’s way: cakes to mark royal weddings, jelly and ice cream for those whose tonsils had been removed. At one point, a Miss B J Anderson left a legacy to the hospital specifically so that each child would find a half pound of chocolates in their stockings come Christmas. A letter of 1936 from the hospital steward to Harrod’s complained that the bread the store had provided – 707 brown loaves over five days – was too “wet and sticky”. An offer of broken biscuits from another shop was declined on the grounds that it was difficult to give so many children an equal portion.
The exhibition takes its title from Received: A Blank Child, an essay by Dickens, published in his magazine Household Words in 1853, which describes the spectacle of the foundlings eating their Sunday dinner under the gaze of a middle-class audience, for whom the hospital was a favoured post-church outing (Dickens lived nearby, and was a regular visitor himself). Looking at an engraving by Joseph Swain of this weekly event, bonnets and top hats bobbing just beyond the regimented rows of girls in white aprons, a wave of revulsion crept over me. But then I wondered: were these genteel crowds gawping idly, as if at zoo animals, or were they, like me, busy counting their blessings? Forgive me if I sound, at this point, like some wizened Methodist minister, but I must commend Feeding the 400 to you this holiday season. Make a detour. Break off, temporarily, from your ceaseless shopping. It can be seen in its entirety in less time than it takes to stuff a turkey, and its beneficent effects will see you right through to New Year’s Day at least.
My husband and I have been together for eight years. Throughout our relationship, he has struggled to reach climax through vaginal intercourse. We worked around this and have had a mutually fulfilling sex life. But now we are now trying for a family, it is causing problems. I have tried many times to talk about it with him, but I have been met with a blank refusal.
A sexual impasse can occur even between even smart and cooperative couples. Sometimes, unconscious motivations can block progress. For example, if either you or your husband have an unresolved traumatic childhood issue, it could be an underlying reason to avoid actions that might lead to producing a child – perhaps as an unconscious protective mechanism. And your husband’s defensiveness could be a consequence of fear or anger.
On the other hand, some men enjoy oral and manual intercourse far more than vaginal intercourse, and for them it is simply mechanics, ease, and a question of a better sensation. Perhaps you are just too good at these styles. But different sexual styles are often imbued with meaning. You say that further discussion is not an option, but there is always a way to get beyond his defensiveness. Without being defensive yourself, try to ascertain what the differences in sensation are for him between oral and manual as opposed to vaginal sex. This will give you a clue to the way forward.

Carbohydrates are causing an obesity epidemic and fats silt up your arteries. But protein? It provides the building blocks for essential stuff such as cells, muscles, bone, nails, hormones and enzymes. The word “protein” comes from the Greek and means first, as in most important. We can’t get enough of it. Bodybuilders take protein supplements in the form of milkshakes, energy drinks or bars to build up their muscle bulk. But even ordinary folk see protein as their new best dietary friend. The world market for protein supplements is now firmly mainstream and estimated to reach £8bn a year by 2017.
The UK government’s dietary guidelines state that men need 55.5g and women 45g of protein a day. A chicken breast has at least 23.5g while a 100g steak has 20.9g. In western Europe and the US, people are already eating twice as much protein as recommended by the World Health Organisation. The most recent US dietary guidelines warn that teenage boys and adult men should “reduce overall intake of protein foods” and eat more vegetables. Teenage girls, who often have disturbed eating patterns, and elderly people, who are prone to lose muscle mass as well as appetite, were the only groups identified as being protein-deficient. The New York Times has an ongoing debate about the risks and benefits of protein. Last week, its print edition carried an article with the headline “Is protein a magic bullet?”, though the online version asked “Can you get too much protein?”.
Alarm bells sounded after research published in the journal Cell Metabolism in 2014 (using data from more than 6,000 Americans) concluded that people aged between 50 and 65 who got 20% or more of their calories from protein were 74% more likely to die from cancer than those who ate less protein. The study has been criticised for taking dietary records for only 24 hours. It also surprisingly found that a high-protein diet actually reduced the risk of dying early in those aged over 65. It’s not clear why the results should be so different for the two age groups.
The evidence on protein remains inconclusive. Some studies show that more protein – and fewer carbohydrates – reduces blood pressure and protects against heart disease. What the evidence does suggest is that red or processed meat as a main source of protein is linked to an increase in colon cancer, while fish, chicken and plant sources of protein are healthier. You can only absorb 20g to 40g of protein in one sitting and I could find no robust evidence that guzzling it will increase muscle mass. So, unless you are old, poorly and not eating, you are probably getting enough protein and are unlikely to benefit from supplements – whatever they promise you.

Reflecting on life in 1920s New York, F Scott Fitzgerald opined that “the hangover became a part of the day as well allowed-for as the Spanish siesta”. But while 21st-century bosses may not be quite as accommodating as the Wall Street tycoons of the roaring 20s, hangovers are certainly part of the Christmas party season.
Whether it’s how to avoid them in the first place or negating the suffering after the event, hangovers have been pondered over for millennia. In ancient Rome, Pliny the Elder declared it advisable to line the stomach with a meal of roasted sheep’s intestines before hitting the drink, while centuries later the English herbalist and botanist Nicholas Culpeper wrote that hangovers could be relieved by stuffing the nasal passages with the juice of tree ivy. However, despite having socio-economic consequences higher than many common diseases in terms of absenteeism and reduced work productivity, it is only relatively recently that hangovers have been considered worthy of serious scientific study.
The hangover was first described more than 3,000 years ago in the Susruta Samhita, an Indian textbook on vedic medication. It was described as paramada, a post-drinking condition characterised by thirst, pain in the head and joints, and heaviness of the body, with no known cure.
But the word hangover has only become associated with alcohol in the past century. It first appeared in the English vocabulary in the 19th century as an expression for describing unfinished business from meetings, but it was not until 1904 that the word began to crop up in reference to alcohol.
Hangovers develop when blood-alcohol content returns to zero, leading to headaches, nausea, anxiety, dry mouth, sweating, gastro-intestinal complaints, concentration problems, dizziness, drowsiness and hyper-excitability. One of the causes is the way that the body metabolises the compounds found in alcoholic drinks. Alcoholic drinks contain very small amounts of methanol (in addition to ethanol), which the body breaks down into the toxins formaldehyde and formic acid about 10 hours after drinking, making you feel ill.
Another long-standing scientific theory has been that hangover symptoms are down to dehydration, because alcohol decreases the production of an anti-diuretic hormone, something the body requires to reabsorb water. With less of it available, the body loses fluid through urination. Yet, while hormonal changes resulting from a dehydrated state do cause dry mouth and thirst, studies on the biological changes present the day after excessive drinking suggest it isn’t quite that simple. Many of the cognitive alcohol hangover symptoms – such as memory loss, mood changes and anxiety – appear to be down to the effects of immune system activation and its impact on the central nervous system. As the body tries to process the alcohol metabolites in the bloodstream, it produces tiny molecules called cytokines. Cytokine receptors are particularly dense in the hippocampus, a brain structure crucial to memory function, and some studies have shown that increased cerebral cytokine concentration can cause weakness, decreased appetite, sickness and inability to concentrate.
It has been reported that 28% of drinkers say they never experience a hangover. The exact reasons why are little understood, as even when alcohol exposure is monitored under experimental conditions, there are considerable individual differences in terms of hangover response. It is thought to be down to a mix of genetic and environmental factors. Two genotypes – ADH1B and ALDH2 – are associated with the flushing or blotching response on the face or body following alcohol consumption, and have been found to be related to heightened hangover susceptibility. Some studies also show that heavy hangovers are more common in drinkers with a family history of alcoholism, with alcoholics getting the worst hangovers of all.
Yes. The pathophysiology of why this occurs is not fully known but various studies of university students have found a link between frequent hangovers and adverse neurocognitive outcomes such as decreased white-matter integrity in the frontal part of the brain and the cerebellum, which plays an important role in motor control. It is thought that the former could lead to sustained impairments in memory and attention span.
Fried food can make you feel better. Drinking alcohol lowers your blood-sugar levels and eating a carbohydrate-heavy meal can help restore these to normal.
The common belief is that hangover symptoms become more severe with advancing age, possibly due to the body becoming less efficient at processing alcohol, but, from a scientific viewpoint, there’s little evidence to show that this is true. This is mainly because hangover research is almost entirely carried out on young adults, but the few studies that have been done comparing age groups find that post binge-drinking hangovers are worst in younger people.
The quest for a hangover cure is about as old as recorded history. The oldest known cure is the “hair of the dog”, which does have a biological basis. If you continue drinking alcohol during the hangover phase, your body will stop metabolising methanol into toxins, and go back to processing ethanol, leaving the methanol for later.
But when it comes to dealing with the inevitable, various substances have been tried and tested over the centuries. The Romans recommended raw owls’ eggs, which may have had some beneficial effects, as eggs contain cysteine, an amino acid depleted by alcohol. The ancient Assyrians chose to consume a more dubious concoction of ground birds’ beaks and myrrh. In the era of Genghis Khan, Mongol warriors ate pickled sheep eyes, while in medieval Europe physicians recommended raw eels and bitter almonds.
More recently, a number of companies – no doubt thinking of the vast commercial potential – have tried to develop a valid hangover medication. But while various anti-inflammatories – such as the migraine drug, tolfenamic acid, or herbs such as borage – have shown some benefits, so far no treatments have received FDA approval as scientifically valid hangover cures.
Over the weekend, Anna Wintour, the formidable editor-in-chief of US Vogue, was compelled to issue an apology after being overheard on a train panning Donald Trump, saying his foundation had achieved nothing, and that he would use his presidency to further his personal brand. “I immediately regretted my comments,” she told the Sunday Mirror, “and I apologise. I hope he’ll be a successful president for us all.”
This apology came on the same day Vogue’s younger, savvier sister, Teen Vogue, published an excoriating op-ed on Trump, which quickly went viral. Headlined “Donald Trump is gaslighting America” the piece by Lauren Duca explained the president-elect’s strategy of lying so frequently and egregiously that the public are left not knowing what is true or false (a manipulative technique known as “gaslighting” after the 1938 play Gas Light). Trump’s “rise to power,” writes Duca, “has awakened a force of bigotry by condoning and encouraging hatred, but also by normalising deception.”
It’s not quite the mad-about-the-boy talk one might think of when it comes to teen magazines and, by extension, their readers. But Duca’s piece isn’t a blip for Teen Vogue. While other magazines are publishing ethically dubious trend pieces on the “fashy” haircuts of white nationalist Richard Spencer and his peers, Teen Vogue has been ensuring its readers know that Vice-President-elect Mike Pence voted against the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and once said, referring to abortion law, that he “longed for the day that Roe v Wade is sent to the ash heap of history”.
There are a few reasons the magazine, which is printed quarterly but has a wide web and social media presence, has come out fighting. First, it doesn’t have to toe the same line many publishers do, terrified of losing access to Trump. Teen Vogue probably does not have access to Trump. When the tiny-fisted tantrum of a man rips press credentials from outlets such as the Washington Post for daring to ask questions, the danger is that the press will be cowed into taking an artificially softer line. Teen Vogue isn’t caught up in that game.
Second, teen mags and kids’ books and TV shows have always been more renegade than adults give them credit for: think JK Rowling smuggling political lessons for muggles into her books, or the pro-immigration story of Paddington Bear. It used to be that adults didn’t notice this subterfuge because they weren’t paying attention; now the misapprehension comes more from the pronounced tendency to dismiss the thoughts and culture of Generation Y and all who come afterwards.
But perhaps the main reason for Teen Vogue’s success is the tag team of Phil Picardi, digital editorial director, and Elaine Welteroth, editor. Welteroth is a rare editor of colour in a glossy magazine industry weighed down as much by whiteness as by insert advertising. At 29, she became the youngest editor-in-chief in Condé Nast history.
Since Picardi and Welteroth took the helm, Teen Vogue’s journalism has included a video report from the Standing Rock protest, a piece about recreational drugs being used to treat depression, and the exposure of homophobic tweets of Republican politicians. Duca’s op-ed might have gone viral, partly due to an element of surprise – Teen Vogue published this! – but it isn’t surprising to those of us who have been reading the magazine.
The title hasn’t been stripped of lighter, fashion content because – shocking as this is – young women can be interested in both. Perhaps it isn’t surprising that outlets with younger staff and readers (see also: US Cosmopolitan) are taking a more progressive editorial line, given that the demographic is more diverse in race and sexuality, so has more invested in that worldview. There’s been a lot of hand-wringing about who is or isn’t responsible for Trump, and what to do about him, but Teen Vogue proves that, as with mislaid keys and where you had them last, perhaps the answers aren’t always quite where you looked before.

It is the meal most associated with the UK, along with slurping tea and moaning about the weather. But the great British fish supper could be on the way out, replaced by more continental variations such as squid and chips, as seas continue to warm, the British Ecological Society will be told this week.
Britons may have to adopt a more continental diet when it comes to fish, as climate change sees cold-water fish such as cod gradually replaced by squid and other warm-water species, according to research led by Dr John Pinnegar of Cefas, the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science.
“Our models for 2025 and beyond suggest that seawater temperature may continue to rise in the future,” said Pinnegar. “As a result, UK waters will become more hospitable for some species and less suitable for others, with the overall result that most commercial species will move northwards.”
Squid numbers have increased dramatically over the past 35 years in the North Sea, according to Cefas, which has monitored North Sea fish populations for the past 114 years. It said squid was found at 60% of its 76 survey stations in 2016, compared with just 20% in 1984.
The organisation analyses records of where fish are caught and water temperature, to monitor the impact of climate change and fishing intensity to long-term changes in abundance.
Cod numbers have been slow to recover after overfishing drastically reduced their numbers, according to Cefas. While there was 1.3m tonnes of cod in the North Sea in 1971, numbers fell to 124,000 tonnes in 2004. Following the imposition of fish stock quotas, that increased to 295,000 tonnes in 2016, but scientists believe cod reproduction has been hampered by warming waters.
The UK became a net importer of fish in 1984, a year after the Common Fisheries Policy and its quotas were introduced. Two-thirds of British catch – including scallops and langoustines – are exported, while British consumers remain loyal to varieties of traditional fish no longer caught by Britons, such as cod.
“UK consumers enjoy eating quite a limited range of seafood, but in the long term we will need to adapt our diets,” said Pinnegar. “In 2025 and beyond, we may need to replace cod and other old favourites with warm-water species such as squid, mackerel, sardine and red mullet.”
Pinnegar, who will present his results at the British Ecological Society annual meeting at ACC, Liverpool, on Monday, said small-scale fisheries targeting warm-water species such as squid, sardine and anchovy would be likely to overtake fisheries catching more traditional species such as haddock and cod.
The Scottish Fisherman’s Federation recently argued that Brexit could help the UK’s fishing industry to become a world-leading seafood exporter like Norway, the world’s leading producer of salmon and the second largest seafood exporter.
Bertie Armstrong, its chief executive, said the referendum result would enable Britain to regain control of its waters after decades of “common grazing” rights given to European neighbours.
In their quest to make employees happier, companies around the world have been busy installing play equipment in the workplace. Google has set up slides in its Zurich office so engineers can whizz between floors. The online shoe retailer Zappos encourages employees to dress as their favourite animal on certain days. There are US companies that give staff an opportunity to be ninjas for the day. Fussball tables, computer games, action figures and scooters have become fixtures in some workplaces. And if you walked into the offices of Inventionland, you could be mistaken for assuming you were in a children’s playground: workspaces there include a fake pirate ship, a tree house, and a giant shoe.
The lengths companies go to in order to make employees happy to spend increasingly long hours at work do not stop there: Tony Hsieh, chief executive of Zappos, has been known to down vodka shots with employees in interviews. And Expedia, ranked this year as the happiest workplace in the UK, has modelled its London office on a night club with free bars, chill-out zones and Formula One simulators.
In The Wellness Syndrome, the book I wrote with Carl Cederström, we took a look at the increasing fascination with happiness at work. We found a growing industry of “funsultants” offering advice on how to make workforces more positive. Firms such as Zappos have started to employ chief happiness officers. There is also a booming field of management research on positivity at work.
But despite all this effort, work still sucks. According to a recent study by the London School of Economics, the place where we feel most miserable is work. There is only one place and circumstance that makes us feel worse – being sick in bed.
The clamour to make employees happy at work is driven by one of the oldest cliches in the human resource management playbook: that a happy worker is a good worker. As William Davies shows in his book The Happiness Industry, this idea has been part of management theory since at least the 1930s. The problem is that there have been decades of research on the link between employee satisfaction and productivity, and the results are pretty inconclusive.
There are studies that find if you show students a standup comedy routine and then get them to spot errors in a piece of writing, they will do better than students who have not seen the comedy routine. However, another study, of a major UK supermarket chain, found that the stores with the least satisfied employees were the most productive and profitable.
Happiness at work may be good for some jobs – such as customer-facing work where you need to make members of the public feel upbeat too – but there is evidence to suggest happiness could be a liability in other roles. One study, for instance, found that people who were angry tended to get better outcomes during a negotiation than a happy person would. People in a good mood were also worse at noticing an act of deception than people in a bad mood.
While happiness at work is not always good for productivity, surely it must be good for individual employees? This is not always true either. To proceed with an unerring emphasis on being happy can crowd out other emotions; anger, sadness, anxiety and uncertainty – all staples of the contemporary workplace – become a no-no. This implicit ban on negative emotions can therefore be emotionally stunting for employees. A number of recent studies show that being able to express a range of positive and negative emotions is important, particularly when people are dealing with difficult experiences.
But giving space for a range of emotions at work can also be important for the health of the entire organisation. This is wonderfully illustrated by a recent study considering why the mobile phone maker Nokia failed. In 2007, the year the iPhone launched, Nokia was the world’s leading mobile-phone maker. It had ample information about Apple’s venture, so should have been able to successfully challenge it.
However, the Finnish company had invested heavily in a smartphone operating system called Symbian, which wasn’t working well. Middle managers in the company knew it, but they feared communicating the bad news up the hierarchy because they didn’t want to appear to be negative. They had got the message: if you wanted to keep your division open, it was imperative to be only upbeat and pass on positive news. Because senior managers only got positive news, it took them too long to ditch Symbian, switch operating systems and launch a decent smartphone. By that point, Apple and Samsung had overtaken Nokia. Now Nokia no longer makes mobile phones.
The sad truth is that being constantly on the lookout for happiness may actually mean happiness eludes us. This point was illustrated by a study in which psychologists got two groups of people to do something that usually makes people happy – watching a film of someone winning an ice-skating competition. They then tested how happy the experience made them. Before watching the video, one group read out a statement about how important it was to be happy and have an upbeat attitude; the other group did not.
The psychologists found that the group that didn’t read out the statement actually tended to be more happy after watching the video. This suggests that when we talk about how important happiness is, we become less likely to find it, even when we have experiences that usually make us happy.
Wanting to be happy at work is fair enough. But being forced to be happy at work can be troubling. If organisations were genuinely interested in making their employees happy at work, then they would probably give up on the corporate clowning and look at some much more downbeat interventions. A simple step would be allowing employees to work from home at least some of the time. One experimental study found employee satisfaction and productivity shot up when people were allowed to work from home.
A second simple step would be to stop interrupting workers with all sorts of pointless demands such as long emails, bureaucratic forms and compulsory happiness initiatives. A study by researchers at Harvard Business School found workers felt most satisfied on days at work when they were just able to consistently focus on an important piece of work and make some meaningful progress on it.
Finally, removing some of the endemic uncertainty that is built into many workplaces would be an excellent step towards making employees more happy at work. In my own work with Mats Alvesson we found that many organisational restructuring and change initiatives achieve very little apart from making employees miserable, building the reputations of a few managers, and fattening the coffers of consultants.
One way organisations really could make their employees happier, aside from slides and vodka shots? Think long and hard before pointless restructuring.
Most human misery can be blamed on failed relationships and physical and mental illness rather than money problems and poverty, according to a landmark study by a team of researchers at the London School of Economics (LSE).
Eliminating depression and anxiety would reduce misery by 20% compared to just 5% if policymakers focused on eliminating poverty, the report found.
Lord Richard Layard, who led the report, said on average people have become no happier in the last 50 years, despite average incomes more than doubling.
The economist and former adviser to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown said the study, called Origins of Happiness, showed that measuring people’s satisfaction with their lives should be a priority for every government. The researchers analysed data from four countries including the US and Germany.
Extra spending on reducing mental illness would be self-financing, the researchers added, because it would be recovered by the government through higher employment and increased tax receipts together with a reduction in NHS costs from fewer GP visits and hospital A&E admissions.
“Tackling depression and anxiety would be four times as effective as tackling poverty. It would also pay for itself,” he said.
The report supports the arguments put forward by Layard over several decades that social and psychological factors are more important to the wellbeing of individuals than income levels.
“Having a partner is as good for you as being made unemployed is bad for you,” he said.
The report claims that state-run organisations, including schools, must become more focused on tackling anxiety and mental health issues.
“This evidence demands a new role for the state – not ‘wealth creation’ but ‘wellbeing creation’,” Layard said. “In the past, the state has successively taken on poverty, unemployment, education and physical health. But equally important now are domestic violence, alcoholism, depression and anxiety conditions, alienated youth, exam mania and much else. These should become centre stage.”
The economist said it was a curse on children that they were judged by society solely on their educational attainment. The report adds: “The strongest factor predicting a happy adult life is not children’s qualifications but their emotional health. There is also powerful evidence that schools have a big impact on children’s emotional health, and which school a child goes to will affect their emotional wellbeing as much as it affects their exam performance.”
Layard rejected accusations that he was arguing against closing income inequalities but said improvements in mental health services would have a greater impact.
The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has pledged to increase funding for mental health services. In September he said the care offered to children and young people was the service’s biggest weakness.
But the Department of Health admitted last month that the number of mental health nurses working in the NHS in England has dropped by almost a sixth since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, from 45,384 in England to 38,774 in July this year.
The report will be presented to a conference in London on Monday that has been organised by the LSE and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

The nation’s favourite gardener on his bond with the subject of his current book – his pet dogs – and why he won’t be appearing on TV shows with ‘celebrity’ in the title
As I had only girls I made sure they all got cars, trains and construction toys (Letters, 10 December). Only one was ever interested. The next generation was all-girls too until a lone boy was born. He was so different from all the girls, fascinated by how things worked, magnets and Lego from babyhood on. I gave him a doll and buggy. He threw out the doll and made the buggy into a vehicle. This is typical and I do not believe girls fail to show an interest in engineering because of the toys they are given. Let the boys be engineers if they want to and the girls not be if they don’t want to, as most don’t.

• As an older woman, I agree with Dr Long’s letter that it is important for us to provide gender-neutral toys for girls. But as a trustee for a charity that helps women in difficult circumstances, mainly victims of domestic violence, I wonder why there is not an accompanying cry for us to provide more toys and experiences for boys that will encourage and promote the importance of care and nurture in society.

• Nigel Long blames “older women” for pressure on girls to have “girly” toys, rather than toys that might encourage interest in science and engineering. Apart from wondering how “older” is defined, or where the evidence comes from, I can assure Dr Long that this older woman, mother and grandmother, grew up playing with dolls and dinky toys, farm set, dressing up box, building bricks and Meccano (and I became a geologist). My two daughters grew up playing with a similar variety of dolls, cars, Lego, etc, at a time when girly pink stuff wasn’t all pervasive; and wasn’t desired by my girls. It is only the current generation of young girls who appear to require pink glittery clothes and toys, princessy and distinctly not gender-neutral. Blame TV, franchises, aggressive advertising, parents, or the young girls themselves, but please don’t pile the blame on us “older women”. We have enough to put up with.

• As a right-on Guardian-reading mother I made sure my two boys had gender-neutral toys as well as some toys usually given to girls. But as a grandmother to a girl I have been guilty of buying her girly pink things and thoroughly enjoying it. The problem with us “older women”, Dr Long, is that we were conditioned to be into all things girly and it’s hard not to feel delight in something pink. Don’t get me started on the shoe fetish. Please be assured that I know it’s wrong and am trying to change.

Forget elves, Santa and reindeer – Christmas 2016 is all about the mermaid. Or, to put it more accurately, the mermaid blanket. Resembling a knitted sleeping bag with a fish-like tail, and available for children and adults, the mermaid blanket is this year’s answer to the slanket or the onesie.
Sceptics might not appreciate the slightly fishy design, not to mention the impracticality of whipping it off for that ad-break cup of tea, but this accessory has already become the most-watched deal on Amazon on Cyber Monday and a bestseller on Asos.
Anyone who uses public transport in London will be familiar with Blue Vanilla’s Ariel mermaid blanket – advertised on the tube with the image of a glamorous young woman on a couch, in full hair and makeup, blanket pulled up to her chest.
The online fast-fashion retailer has already sold more than 11,000 Ariels at £29 a pop, and has a waiting list of roughly 1,000 people. Online marketing manager Teresa Ktistaki predicts another 6,000 could be sold before Christmas. “It’s a nice gift because it’s useful but also fun,” she says of the product, which was originally launched in October.
Mermaids have been a thing in pop culture for a while – from Azealia Banks’s Mermaid Ball performance in 2012 to Rebel Wilson’s mermaid dancing in Pitch Perfect, the Instagram trend for a #mermaidcrowns (a tiara made from conch shells), and the upcoming Splash remake starring Channing Tatum. Mermaid blankets are already massive on social media, with more than 27,000 posts for #mermaidblanket – and that’s before the tearing of wrapping paper on Christmas morning reveals several thousand more.
Celebrities including Geordie Shore’s Holly Hagan have further boosted the chances of finding a mermaid blanket under the tree – in September, she posted a picture on Twitter of her wearing one, accessorised with a Barbie-like manicured hand.
It is reality TV stars such as Hagan, says Ktistaki, who influence her customers as well as the current cross-generation preoccupation with mythical undersea creatures. “The feedback we’re getting is that everyone loves mermaids,” she says. “Grandmothers, grandchildren … it’s a bit of a dream.”
When I was in my 20s, I remember my therapist patiently listening to me complain about how out-of-my-depth I often felt around other gay men. I was asking her why they always seemed so effortlessly aloof and cool, whereas I was – and to some extent, still am – a slobbering golden retriever of a person, quivering with eagerness to be your new best friend.
“You’ll waste a lot of time and spoil a lot of happiness comparing your insides to other people’s outsides,” she told me.
I think about this a lot when I see famous people – rock stars, celebrities, politicians – going into meltdown mode. Trainwreck TV is one of our culture’s most avid pleasures. In the words of Edina Monsoon from Absolutely Fabulous, “It’s the only blood sport they haven’t banned, darling.”
Right now, everyone is waiting to see what the next eruption from Kanye West will be now that he’s out of the hospital after months – some would say years – of erratic behavior, bizarre concert spectacles and public meltdowns. It’s almost expected, since the Grammy nominations were announced this week and West was again shut out of the major categories.
A few years ago the spectacle du jour was Amanda Bynes, and before that, Britney Spears when she shaved her head and ended up under psychiatric care.
We’ve shaken our heads and tutted over the breakdowns of Mariah Carey and Courtney Love, Amy Winehouse and Gary Busey, Katt Williams and Dave Chappelle, Lindsay Lohan and Anna Nicole Smith – any celebrities who have had the misfortune to exhibit symptoms of mental illness while living in the public eye.
We take a certain sanctimonious pleasure in these people’s public disintegration and show shockingly little compassion, as though their wildly successful careers and personal fortunes make their pain more acceptable than that of mere mortals.
If a random woman we don’t know starts babbling nonsense and getting hysterical while we’re out shopping, it’s tragic. We avert our eyes. We tell our families when we get home how unsettling and upsetting it was. But when Spears does it, it’s a Rolling Stone cover story that we consume with the eagerness of kids tearing into a bag of candy.
It’s the same mentality that allows a racist troll like Milo Yiannopoulos to airily wave away the steaming, reeking mountain of harassment his followers and supporters firehosed at Saturday Night Live and Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones, mostly on Twitter. Leslie Jones is a rich and famous actress; who cares if people say nasty things about her on the internet?
At what point do we stop valuing celebrities’ humanity?
Is it an income-level thing? Kanye West has got a lot of money. He’s one of the most well-known performers on the planet who isn’t Beyoncé or Beyoncé-adjacent. He has broken paradigms and yes, over-extended his brand, as it were, in a couple of areas, but he’s also a creative young person with a young family under tremendous pressure who lost his beloved mother nine years ago.
He has written openly about his love for liquor, cocaine and other intoxicants. It does not take a tremendous amount of imagination to piece together what may have happened here to a stressed-out artist in pain.
Let’s pretend for a moment that it isn’t Kanye West, but Keith West, who you knew in college who works for a life insurance company now. What if his mother died in surgery and he began a multi-year downward spiral?
Would you be gawking if Keith got placed on involuntary hold in a psychiatric unit? Would you be sharing links about Keith on Twitter and Facebook and marveling that someone could become such a mess?
Kanye West may be, as President Obama once said, “a jackass” from time to time. But he’s also still a person.
Millions of dollars in the bank doesn’t mean anything when you want your mom and she’s gone, I suspect, any more than the significantly less princely sum in my own checking account does. You can’t buy five more minutes to be with your dead mom for any amount of money, large or small.
So, maybe the next time you start to click on that Perez Hilton link about whichever celebrity’s mind has most recently hit the big bug-zapper, take a second. Ask yourself how you’d feel if your life’s most humiliating, confused, disoriented moment was out there for public amusement.
If the person suffering at the other end of that hyperlink was Keith and not Kanye, would you still click it?
It’s incongruous to sit with Monty Don in a Soho restaurant. His grin demands a backdrop of hedgerow and coppice, not the clogged London streetscape outside Quo Vadis. When we meet for lunch the restaurant is in a late stage of refurbishment so the exterior is temporarily scaffolded and only half the dining room is open. Don seems a bit confined at our corner table, itching for a skyline. He lived in London for nine years from the age of 25, and this was a fairly regular haunt back then in one of its previous incarnations. The arrival of some of chef Jeremy Lee’s signature rustic manchet bread makes him feel more at home; he loosens his shoulders a bit as he breaks into it.
We talk about the only previous time we have sat in a restaurant together, when Don was hired as the gardening correspondent of the Observer magazine, of which I’d just become deputy editor. That was 23 years ago. I remember being struck then, as I am now, by his slightly timeless physical presence in a room of flighty city dwellers; though back then he was new to writing about gardens (the jewellery business he had run with his wife, Sarah, had just gone bankrupt and they had lost everything) as soon as he started to talk about his plans there seemed no doubt he would make it a vocation. His ancestor was the botanist George Don, foreman of the Chelsea Physic Garden and inveterate tropical plant hunter. Monty seemed directly grafted from the same stock.
He recalls that lunch and the job that followed it as something of a before and after for him. “I remember the Observer calling and saying they would like me to do the column,” he says, “and the editor explaining that it wasn’t unfortunately a ‘life-changing’ contract, with a bit of a laugh. I think it was £250 a week. But the fact was that to me at that moment it really was life-changing. We had a young family, we had lost our house and everything. The idea that somebody was saying we are going to give you this cheque every week was like a miracle.”
Don had moved out to a rundown smallholding, Longmeadow in Herefordshire, where he has lived ever since, nurturing and developing the seeds of that writing life, along with the gardens that, after the Observer, became the setting of BBC Gardeners’ World. He has no hankering for city life, never did really. Even as a student at Cambridge he kept chickens. And in London, he says, he spent more time in his patch of garden than anywhere else. “I used to go to the cinema a bit, the occasional meal out. But I don’t crave any of that now. There isn’t really a decent cinema for miles near us anyway.”
As a long-term president of the Soil Association, from which he recently stepped down, he has a clear passion for the kind of seasonal British cooking that Lee has made his name with at Quo Vadis. Don loves good fresh ingredients, but, like Lee, doesn’t fetishise them. He orders his leek, bacon and egg salad, and salt cod and shrimp cakes to follow with the minimum of fuss and eats them and a generous side of parsley potatoes with the relish of a man who knows flavour when he tastes it. A while ago he and Sarah published a farmhouse cookbook and the garden supplies most of what they eat. They cook together as often as they can, though work on his series Big Dream Small Spaces, in which he helps suburban gardeners create their fantasy plots, has seen him on the road a lot of late.
“More than ever I want a few friends and family and quiet and space,” he says. “Sarah is more sociable, but our problems are always about not spending enough time with each other than too much.”
The other ingredient of that life is the occasion for our meeting. Having been pestered to for many years, Don has written a book about his lifelong love affair with his dogs. The book’s star (and the alternative star of Gardeners’ World) is his golden retriever, Nigel. It’s an affectionate and surprisingly affecting story. For a while Don couldn’t work out how to tell it, without it seeming too saccharine. “It clicked when I based it around the garden,” he says. “It became a map, Nigel’s territory, that is where he and I both live.”
The other hurdle was to write it straight without any distancing ironies. “Any kind of blokeiness had to be silenced. You have to put yourself in that frame of mind when you are on your own sitting with a dog by your side with the rain beating on the window.”
For Don the companionship of dogs is of a piece with what he sees as the unique British passion for gardening. It’s a result of a race memory of the brutalities of the industrial revolution, he believes, a psychological need for green thoughts in green shades. “That all happened so fast, 200 years ago, that it is as if we are still coming to terms with it,” he suggests. “What we didn’t lose was the sense of what we lost. Our obsession with gardening is unique. In Italy or even in France, where they didn’t have that revolution until a century later, they don’t see why you would garden yourself when you can afford to pay someone to do it. They regard gardening like we regard plumbing. And the whole British caricature of a grand lady in tweeds with her bottom sticking out of a herbaceous border. It doesn’t exist in those countries.”
Dogs are the other element of that transplanted desire for older rural harmonies. “I like dogs because they are not humans,” he says. “I get very uncomfortable when people start talking about dogs as ‘my boys’. What is wonderful is that this is a wild animal which has chosen to go into partnership with you. It is the only wild animal that really does that.”
Built into that relationship is a sense of dogs tracing the contours of his own life, often in ways that writing the book has revealed to him. “When I recorded the audiobook I realised just how much was involved,” he says. “There are three dogs in the book I’ve had who have died. And I broke down completely reading about one of them and when I turned round the engineer was also sobbing. I thought: ‘Jesus what is going on here?’ We had to stop and have a cup of tea and get a grip…”
In some ways, like the garden, the dogs have been a way of measuring out the years. Don says he’s never forgotten the tougher times and reflexively works very hard to make sure they don’t return. After a minor stroke in 2008 he had to step down from the BBC for nearly a year, and the money immediately dried up. “I had a bit of rainy day money for the first time ever,” he says. “And then it rained and all the money in the bank got spent. I guess I still have a sense of the wolf, if not at the door, then at least prowling on the horizon. Shit does happen.” He can’t imagine packing it in – “why would you not work?” – but he does try to be selective.
He must have been asked to go into the jungle?
“I have – and to dance. All of them,” he says. “My basic philosophy is never do anything with the word ‘celebrity’ attached to it. Without being overly pompous, if you have worked hard to have an audience trust you a bit, why blow it? That is my currency.”
It’s also, you guess, a kind of psychological necessity for him to keep things as “real” as possible. Don has long suffered from bouts of seasonal depression and the rhythm and labour of the garden – and the smallholding he farms with his son in the Black Mountains over the Welsh border – has proved the best antidote. It’s probably telling that a part of him still thinks of himself ruefully as a “failed novelist” (he published a couple of works of fiction in his 20s). But there are compensations. “The farm uses up a lot of my creative urges,” he says. “It’s a sort of rough and ready space, I don’t film there.” He and his son keep 500 breeding ewes and maybe 50 heifers, all organic. “If I’m honest,” he says, “the thing I am proudest of is my varieties of wild flowers in the hay meadow.” Holding that very bright thought in mind, he slurps his coffee and heads out into the black and white London afternoon.

I made a vegetable loaf the other day, seed-encrusted and flecked with herbs, a practice run for the big feast itself. A tangle of root vegetables, parsnips and carrots mostly, coarsely grated and held together with buttery onion and a little egg, the plan is that it will be the vegetarian option, though it would make a fine accompaniment for the roast bird. Soft and giving, with the crunch of seeds and woody herbs, the loaf sliced neatly enough. The outside had crisped up nicely in its wrapping of buttered parchment.
The loaf was good, but needed some sort of gravy. We made it with onions and mushrooms, a sauce as dense and dark as Christmas pudding. Included in the recipe is a bitter stout which we tamed with sweet redcurrant jelly. You can tinker with the bitter-sweet thing to your heart’s content, letting the fruit jelly dissolve into the simmering gravy, tasting as you go, to get something to everybody’s liking.
The next day I fried slices of the loaf in a little butter and ate them with shredded red cabbage and kale with slices of crisp apple, pomegranates and sticky dates. I warmed up a pan of the onion gravy, too. A meatless feast I will happily go along with, but a Christmas feast without gravy would be unthinkable.
Let the loaf rest for 10 minutes or so before slicing, using a palette knife to ease it from the baking parchment.
You will also need a loaf tin measuring about 22cm x 12cm x 8cm, lined with baking parchment.
Peel the parsnips, then cut lengthways into quarters. Grate them finely using the coarse blade of a food processor, slightly thinner than matchsticks, then do the same with the carrot. (I don’t find it necessary to peel the carrots, only to scrub them with a vegetable brush.) Grate the apple, without peeling it, and add to the bowl.
Warm half the butter in a shallow pan, then add the grated root vegetables and apple and let them cook, for 3 or 4 minutes, until they are bright and approaching softness. Tip them into a large mixing bowl. Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Peel, halve and finely slice the onions. Melt the remaining butter in the shallow pan then cook the onion until it is soft and pale gold. Peel the garlic, crush finely then add to the onion and continue cooking. Tip the onion and garlic into the bowl with the carrots and parsnips. Add the chopped parsley to the mixture then finely chop the rosemary needles and thyme and add them, too. Add the hemp, pumpkin, sunflower and poppy seeds and a generous grinding of salt and pepper. Break the eggs into a bowl, beat them lightly to combine yolks and whites, then fold into the mixture. Combine the ingredients making sure the seeds, eggs and herbs are evenly distributed.
Line the loaf tin with baking parchment then butter it generously. Scatter a few thyme sprigs over the bottom of the tin. Transfer the mixture into the loaf tin, pressing it firmly into place. Smooth the surface level and cover with buttered parchment. Place the loaf tin on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes, until lightly firm to the touch.
Remove from the oven and leave to settle for 10 minutes then turn out of the tin and carefully peel away the paper. Cut into slices and serve with the sauce (below) or Cumberland or cranberry sauce.
A dark and deeply flavoured accompaniment for the vegetable loaf (above), but also good for spooning over baked vegetables or a slice of pie.
Enough for 6
onions 2, medium
butter 40g
garlic 3 cloves
button mushrooms 250g
olive oil 3 tbsp
thyme sprigs 8
plain flour 1-2 tbsp
vegetable stock 250ml, hot
stout or other dark beer 250ml 
fruit jelly, such as redcurrant 4 tbsp
Peel the onions, cut them in half from stem to root, then slice each half into thin segments. Warm the butter in a heavy-based saucepan, add the onion and leave to cook over a medium heat. Peel and thinly slice the garlic, add to the onions and continue cooking for a good 15-20 minutes until the onions are thoroughly soft, golden and sweet.
Slice or quarter the button mushrooms as you wish then add them, together with the oil, to the onions. Pull the thyme leaves from their stalks then stir into the onions and mushrooms. When the mushrooms are soft and nut brown, scatter the flour over the surface, stir and cook for a couple of minutes. Pour in the stock and stout and bring to the boil. While stirring, lower the heat, season with salt and black pepper, then leave to simmer for 15-20 minutes.
Stir in the redcurrant or other fruit jelly, taste for sweetness, adding more if you wish. You are after a nicely balanced gravy – savoury and sweet with a deep, wintery character.

From the deepest recesses of your parents’ drinks cabinet they come, the drinks that only see the light at Christmas. A parade of dusty, duty-free misfits, lining up to be sipped once and then packed away with the boxes of sticky dates for another year: Midori, Blue Curaçao, Advocaat. That pink stuff with the baffling Cyrillic-script label.
I have plenty of friends who would include various fortified wines among this selection of kitsch. Sherry, port, marsala and madeira may not be so eccentrically lurid in flavour and appearance, but they are once-a-year propositions for most people. A shame, since these are some of the finest and best value drinks in the world.
Still, if you are only going to buy one fortified wine a year, best make it a good one – and drink it by Twelfth Night. With the exception of madeira, whose unique production process means it will keep pretty much for ever, fortified wines won’t last for more than a few weeks. Stick them in a drinks cupboard and, like any other wine, they’ll become more like vinegar.
I find port is at its best a day or two after opening, when it has had time to breathe, ideally in a decanter. Among my favourites are the suavely nutty Sandeman 20 Year Old Tawny Port (£29.99, Waitrose), Taylor’s perfumed Quinta de Vargellas Vintage Port 2002 (£30, Majestic; Waitrose), and the plush Berry Bros & Rudd LBV by Quinta do Noval 2011 (£16.95; bbr.com).
On a tighter budget, Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Special Reserve Port NV and Tesco Finest Late Bottled Vintage Port 2011 (both £10) both have a level of sweet, dark kirsch and chocolate that you just don’t find in unfortified red wines at the same price.
Port’s place alongside the stilton may be unassailable, but sherry is more versatile, offering the aperitif (the zippy, salty green olives of Valdespino Inocente Fino NV; £13.95, Lea & Sandeman) to the lingering post-meal sipper (the umami depths of Emilio Hidalgo El Tresillo Armontillado Fino; £33, Bottle Apostle; VinCognito).
For enjoying with, or in lieu of the Christmas pudding, Bodegas Toro Albalá Don PX Gran Reserva 1996 (from £17, The Wine Society; Oddbins) from east of Jerez in Montilla, is a molasses-like marvel, while the vibrant Barbeito 10 Year Old Malvasia Madeira (from £32.95 Berry Bros and Rudd; Handford) is superb with mature hard cheeses. But perhaps the most Christmassy fortified concoction I’ve tasted this year is Domaine Jean Bourdy Galant des Abbesses (£39.95, Wine Sensations). A mix of grape juice and Asian spices from the Jura in eastern France, it’s been boiled, blended with grape spirit and aged in barrels for a taste not unlike liquefied lebkuchen.
If fortified wines are at their best in a fireside setting, other drinks are just as capable of inducing the ruminative postprandial calm that is, for me at least, the purpose of Christmas. It can be prompted by a dark beer, such as the smoky Meantime London Porter (£2.29, 50cl, Marks & Spencer), or whisky, such as the smoke and sea of Islay’s Laphroaig 10 Year Old (£26.50, Asda); the honeyed graciousness of Speyside’s Glenrothes Select Reserve (£36.45, Whisky Exchange); or the easy-drinking fruitiness of Akashi Japanese Blended Whisky (from £32, 50cl Waitrose; M&S; Oddbins).
But there will be times over the next couple of weeks that call for a pick-me-up. A gin and tonic made from Jensen’s elegant Bermondsey Dry Gin (£25.95, Whisky Exchange), say. Or a lighter long drink that uses vermouth as a base. Italy’s Riserva Carlo Alberto Vermut Sec (£18.99, Drink Shop) comes in a bottle that would be very much at home at the back of a vintage drinks cupboard. But its bittersweet Mediterranean herbiness works just as well over ice at a cafe table in Rome in high summer as it does before dinner on Christmas Day.
Marco de Bartoli Vigna la Miccia Marsala Superiore Oro DOC 5 Anni, Sicily, Italy (£23.90 tannico.co.uk)
Marco de Bartoli, the late master of Sicily’s great fortified wine style, may have passed the baton to his children, but the quality of the estate’s marsalas remains second to none. There’s elegance in its mix of dried and fresh fruit with hazelnuts and hints of toffee, and it has a sweet, fresh raciness that makes it so good with blue cheese.
Casa Mariol Vermut Blanco, Catalonia, Spain (£20, Bottle Apostle)
Gorgeously light, fragrant, herbal vermouth from Catalonia, a blend of dry white wine made from macabeo grapes with herbs, nuts and spices steeped in neutral grape spirit. Serve straight up with an olive, a slice of citrus or with a splash of salty, fizzy mineral water as a lighter, Christmas morning alternative to G&T.
Maynards 10 Year Old Tawny Port, Portugual (£9.99, Aldi)
The Maynards range of ports are a real strength of the Aldi range, not least this classy blend of wines that have spent an average 10 years mellowing in barrel. A glorious mix of baking spice, sweet figs and dried fruit, and a genuine bargain when most tawny ports of this age and quality cost twice the price.
Siren Barrel-Aged Caribbean Chocolate Cake Stout (£6, 330ml, 8.5%, Oddbins)
From Berkshire’s Siren, one of the best of Britain’s ever-expanding craft brewing scene, this is a superbly rich, complex and winter-warming brew that evolves in the glass, offering dried citrus peel and lemon zestiness as well as the titular darker flavours of cocoa and roasted coffee bean.
Diplomatico Rum Reserva Exclusiva (£40, Waitrose)
Dark rum provides the bass notes and punch in many of my favourite cocktails, but this superb example from Venezuela is really one for fireside solo sipping. Aged for 12 years in oak barrels, it has the texture of velvet and flavours of molasses, vanilla, and spicy Christmas cake.
There is in my family a deep appreciation for Christmas. We begin with a trip across town to buy a tree and, from then on, all surfaces are laden with the appropriate kitsch. The warm atmosphere is fuelled by the candles of constantly spinning angel chimes and the only space in the house is the empty shelf in the Christmas cupboard. I jokingly protest but with each year I love it more and every day we celebrate in the kitchen.
I love to cook afresh with the extra time in the holidays, taking new approaches with known ingredients and recipes. Here, I’ve used things one might find lying around already, such as sprouts and Brazil nuts. So, while these dishes are loosely based on things I’ve eaten in Italy, they could also be described as Anglo-Italian – except the pizza pie which is a straight-up Neapolitan classic. “When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie …” I can hear everyone singing it now, and I can imagine immigrants from the south of Italy (like my grandfather) eating new versions of this with whatever they could find in the US at Christmas time a hundred years ago. This is the spirit of these recipes. Italian-ish, maybe. I’m far less of a purist, at least in the holidays, and am more interested in having fun in the kitchen. Some are beyond easy, others take a bit longer; but they are all straightforward, tasty and just slightly different to what you thought you were going to make.
At the end, there are two desserts. Nora Ephron says in her essay What I Wish I’d Known that you can order more than one dessert. My wife did this week, and I think I am therefore allowed this, not just now but forever.
Ducks and geese are stuffed in the same manner as a whole pig in central Italy. Keep removing the fat during cooking and you’ll end up with a delicious, fragrant Christmas roast. Toss whole peeled potatoes into the roasting tray if you’d like to, but if you want to try a goose, leave the fresh pork out.
Serves 6
duck 1, with liver, heart and gizzards
garlic 2 cloves
fennel leaves 1 sprig and/or 1tsp fennel seeds
rosemary 2 sprigs, leaves removed
good salami 80g, cubed
whole peppercorns 8
lemon 1, zested
baby back ribs 1 rack, cut into 3
quinces 2
honey 2 tbsp
fennel 4 bulbs
Chop the duck offal together with the garlic, fennel tops, half the rosemary, salami, peppercorns and lemon zest. Cut away any excess fat from the cavity of the duck and turn over. Using strong scissors cut either side of the back bone to open the duck up. Season and fill with the stuffing. Close, overlapping the two sides and tie tight around the middle to secure it shut; then at either end and between them again, making sure it’s closed fast. Take your time doing this, it’s even more satisfying than wrapping presents. Chop the rest of the rosemary and cover the pork with it.
Put the meat in a capacious deep roasting pan and season. Put into the hot oven for 30 minutes until it starts to smell good and a lot of fat has rendered out. Remove, turn the heat down to 150C/gas mark 2. and pour off the fat.
Peel the quinces, core, cut into quarters and toss with honey. Halve the fennel bulbs. Add to the pan with the meat, loosely cover with tin foil and return to the oven. Roast for a further 1½ hours, going to the oven door to baste and turn things around from time to time.
It is possible to make this pie without a leavened crust, but this is the better version. A centrepiece of the antipasto table, Neapolitans eat this on Christmas Eve.
Serves 6, as a starter
For the pizza
dried yeast 1 tsp
tepid water 140g
good quality organic strong bread (or pasta) flour 200g
salt 4g
escarole 1 head (400g-ish)
garlic 2 cloves, peeled
anchovy fillets 6
green and black olives 50g, roughly chopped
pine nuts 20g
salted capers 20g, rinsed (not under vinegar)
currants 15g, soaked in hot water
pepper
To make the dough, mix the yeast with the water and leave for 5 minutes before mixing into the flour with salt. This can be done in a bowl and then transferred to the surface for kneading. Knead for 8 minutes, keep turning by 90° and stretching the dough out. Once soft and springy, cover with plastic and allow half an hour at room temperature before moving to the fridge for 24 hours. Should you keep a bread starter you can substitute a soft dough of your own. Allow the dough to come back to room temperature before stretching.
For the filling, thoroughly clean and roughly chop the escarole. If you can’t find escarole, frisée is a close relative and a good alternative. Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a pot with the garlic. When the garlic is golden add the anchovies, olives, pine nuts, capers and drained currants. Stir a bit, bin the garlic, pile on the washed escarole and put a lid on. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring often until really quite cooked. If it looks especially wet, wait until mostly evaporated. Season just with pepper, as it should be salty enough, and allow to cool.
Heat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6 and generously oil a 20cm cake tin. Handling gently, cut off ⅔ of the dough and begin to stretch into a round on a floured surface. Gently roll out until it fits the tin like a pie crust. Then fill with the escarole and cover with the other piece of dough which you have also rolled. Turn the first dough over the second at the edges to make a border. Brush with olive oil and prick some holes through the top with a fork.
Bake for 35 minutes, until golden on the top and sides. Best enjoyed once cooled a bit.
This simple antipasto fills a gap that traditionally would be insalta del rinforzo, anglicised with brussels sprouts. Spared the usual soggy overcooking, they retain a vegetable heat all their own, like mild horseradish. Add peppercorns, or chillis, if you’d like more of a hit. I’ll keep some of these to eat with the leftover cold cuts and cheeses.
Really peel back the sprouts to their “sweeter” hearts. If they look a third of their size, all the better. Cut some small cauliflower florets about the same size and slice the tomatoes lengthways into four. Cut the garlic cloves into two and bring them to the boil in a pot of cold water with a large pinch of sea salt. Let them boil for five minutes before adding the sprouts and cauliflower and letting them boil another four. Then add the tomatoes and leave for two minutes. Drain and spread out.
When they are mostly dry but still hot toss with the vinegar and put in a jar or bowl and cover with oil (and more salt, to taste). When they are cool, cover and move to the fridge.
Eat cold. Better after 24 hours. They’ll keep all holiday (10 days) in the fridge. Make the person with a cold eat the garlic cloves and, so as not to be wasteful, re-use the oil.
Brazil nuts are full of nutrients but, don’t worry, they’re also wildly rich. The cooking and squeezing of the radicchio helps to remove its bitterness, however, if you can find a posh forced Italian radicchio, it’s not so much of an issue.
Serves 4
brazil nuts 8
radicchio ½ head
water 3 tbsp
extra virgin olive oil 30ml
garlic a thin slice from the tip of a clove
lemon
celery 1 head
truffle 1 (optional)
Soak the brazil nuts overnight in water. Tear the leaves from the radicchio and blanch in highly salted boiling water for 2 minutes. Move straight into a bowl of ice water and quickly cool. Then return to the boiling water for another 2 minutes and again to the ice. Once cold, squeeze dry.
Drain the nuts and put in a blender with the water, oil, garlic, a small spritz of lemon and pinch of salt. Whizz for a minute and pass through a fine sieve or tea strainer.
Peel the celery back to half its size and slice off only the exposed part of the root. Pick some of the pale leaves and slice thinly. Toss everything and serve with the truffle grated or sliced on top.
Persimmons are overlooked, particularly as there are fewer varieties of winter fruit. This crostata is not too sweet, so be careful with the nutmeg lest it take over.
Serves 8
toasted hazelnuts 50g
flour 200g
icing sugar 70g
salt a pinch
butter 90g, cubed
whole eggs 3
pears 2, very ripe
persimmons 2
lemon zest and juice of 1
ricotta 350g
golden caster sugar 70g
egg yolk 1
cream 100ml
nutmeg
Blitz the nuts in a food processor. Add the flour, blitz some more and then pulse in the sugar, salt and finally the butter. When crumbed, add an egg taking care not to overwork. Bring the dough together on the surface and chill for 45 minutes. Then break or cut off pieces and press into a 25cm tart shell until uniformly covered and freeze for 30 minutes.
Heat the oven to 190C/gas mark 5 and blind bake the shell with a piece of baking paper filled with baking beans. Cook until golden, about 30 minutes, removing the paper for the last five.
Lower the oven to 160C/gas mark 2½. Bring 400ml of water to the boil with the lemon juice. Slice the pears into ½ cm slices removing the pips and poach for 4 minutes, less if very ripe. Take out of the syrup. Slice the persimmons the same size. Whisk the ricotta with sugar, 2 eggs and 1 yolk, cream, ½ the lemon zest, and a scratch of fresh nutmeg. Fill up the tart shell by alternating fruit and ricotta until full the brim. Bake for 35 minutes turning half way through. Serve completely cool, dusted with icing sugar.
This is almost a drink where the alcohol nearly stops it from freezing. Serve in frozen espresso cups and consume quickly. You can dance all night if you eat it all.
Infuse the mint leaves into the hot coffee. Whisk the egg white with the sugar in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water until thick, shiny and hot. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly before adding the coffee, leaves removed, water and grappa. Cover and freeze for four hours in the bowl, whisking with a fork after the first hour and again before serving. Don’t worry if it looks like it’s separating – it’ll come together in the end.

Stephanie Danler doesn’t much like the “creation myth” that’s attached to her debut novel, Sweetbitter, but it’s proving as stubborn to shift as a red wine stain. So here it is: Danler was a waitress at a French restaurant in the West Village in Manhattan; one of her regulars was a heavyweight editor at Penguin Random House, Peter Gethers, a man Vanity Fair has called “the biggest name in publishing you’ve never heard of”. She told him she’d written a novel and within days she had a two-book deal worth in the high six figures. Sweetbitter, set in a New York restaurant, has become a US bestseller, earned its author comparisons with Jay McInerney and Anthony Bourdain, and been boosted by celebrity admirers (Eva Longoria, Sarah Jessica Parker).
It’s an appealingly dramatic yarn, but a simplification. Danler was working as a waitress – that much is true – but by 2014, when she pitched Gethers, her escape route from restaurants was already plotted out. Sweetbitter was the product of many years work, in part on a post-graduate writers’ programme, and Danler already had an agent. She met 11 publishers in a frenzied week and there were multiple offers before she decided to sign with Gethers and Penguin Random House. She chose them in part because she knew and trusted Gethers, but the bottle of premier cru burgundy she was presented with was, she admits, a winning touch.
“I always felt something about that story whitewashed my hard work,” says Danler, who is 33, on the phone from Los Angeles, where she grew up and now again lives. “But after the first article appeared in the New York Times, I was flooded by 250 emails saying, ‘I’ve been waiting tables for 13 years and hearing this story makes me believe I should keep going.’ Or, ‘You’ve given me so much hope.’ I was like, ‘This is bigger than me. It just is.’ And that’s how fairytales work. That’s how creation myths work. Whether they are tethered to reality or not, they take on a life of their own, because people want to believe that it’s possible.”
Sweetbitter, which was published in the summer, is a gripping, addictive tale that follows Tess, a 22-year-old from Ohio who moves to New York in 2006. She’s hired as a waiter by a high-end restaurant not dissimilar to Danny Meyer’s Union Square Cafe, where Danler herself worked when she first arrived in the city. Tess falls hard for a bartender, Jake, even harder for the sensuous pleasures of food and wine, and a poetic coming-of-age adventure unravels.
The New York Times review called Sweetbitter “the Kitchen Confidential of our time”, but it’s not a comparison that Danler, who has worked front-of-house in restaurants since she was 15, recognises. “I loved that book, he [Bourdain] is a great writer, but I was consciously working against it, because it came out in 2001 and at the time of writing I really felt that there was no more restaurant subculture to expose,” she says. “We’d seen Kitchen Confidential so many times and there’s something very gendered about that portrait. It’s this testosterone-driven, aggressive, rebellious, knives-and-tattoos culture, whereas I’m focused on the more sensual and quotidian aspects of it. I’d think to myself, ‘How can I show the soft beauty of what it’s like to polish glasses or to taste wine or to work the same night over and over again.’ They are just such different approaches to the same material.”
Not that Sweetbitter is coy about the darker aspects of the business, including sex and drug use. “There’s nothing about servers doing cocaine that felt revelatory to me at all,” Danler laughs. “So I didn’t have this nervousness of, ‘I’m showing the warts of the restaurant industry!’ It’s all been done.” A pause, “Maybe I’ve been in New York and around servers too long.”
Danler acknowledges there are elements of autobiography in Sweetbitter. “Oh God, it was an incredibly wild time,” she admits. “But my story of what I was like at 22 – which was bat-shit crazy – is also very different. I didn’t know men like Jake until much later. I spent all of my 20s with the man I would eventually marry. We’re not married any more, but from 22 to 30, I was with my ex-husband. Tess is probably braver and more reckless, because it makes her a more interesting character to watch. And I moved to New York to be a writer. I already had a novel that was heavily inspired by Jay McInerney and Bret Easton Ellis. The groundedness of being a writer never let me fall as far as Tess does.”
There’s a steel to Danler, strength she ascribes to an unconventional upbringing: her father left home when she was three, in hock to a drug dealer, and she fought with her mother. Aged 16, she went to live with her father, unaware that by this point he was using methamphetamine.
“I didn’t know he was a drug addict then, but he was not interested in parenting,” Danler recalls. “I went to high school, had a full-time job and came and went as I pleased. And I stopped being sad about it, because I realised how much freedom it gave me. I’ve always valued that: I know I could move somewhere tomorrow, get a job and take care of myself. That has been the blessing of having... I don’t think they are evil people but I have two very broken parents. Like millions of people do – and you can either be victimised by it or you can work harder.”
Danler has been out of restaurants for 18 months now, but perhaps surprisingly, she insists she misses waitressing. She moved back to LA at the start of the year, to write her second book and, after a decade of antisocial hours, it is disorientating now to be free on Saturday nights or to clock in for work at 9am. “It’s not the physical stuff,” she explains. “There were times I was like, ‘This is the hardest job in the world!’ But I had a very safe space to be extroverted in, where I could try all these different personas and be flirtatious and funny and I’d spend whole nights laughing.”
But surely the end goal was always writing – doesn’t Danler feel more content and happy? “Content and happy,” she muses, “I don’t know about those existing really. I still wake up with tons of anxiety and I feel like a failure all the time. I’ve had this on-paper incredible success, but I think most artists work in a slightly dissatisfied state. That’s what pushes them. So not necessarily happier or more content, but I feel like I’m doing the work I’m supposed to be doing right now.”

The world feels like a different place from the one in which, this time last year, I sat down to write the introduction to our Christmas issue. It is different too, and heaven only knows what the next 12 months will throw at us.
If ever there was a time to pass around plates of goodwill to family, friends and strangers, then this is it. Which is why in this issue we offer a succession of good things – special, thoughtful, generous and delicious – to share with others.
Joe Trivelli has a tempting collection of recipes with their soul in Italy. A duck, stuffed and slowly roasted, a crisp side of celery, radicchio and brazil nuts, and a splendid crostata of pears, persimmons and ricotta. A feast in any language, yet each dish only a short jump from the glistening roast and fruit-laden dessert we know so well.
To my mind, the bits around the bird are the most interesting elements of Christmas dinner. To this end, I have new accompaniments for you: salt-crusted potatoes with blue cheese; mashed parsnips with brussels and honey; a ring of Cumberland sausages baked with bacon and dates. Most of which I would be happy to eat alongside the goose, beef or turkey on the day, or as dishes in their own right at any of the many meals to come over the holidays.
We have our ever popular taste test with the lowdown on the best Christmas food on the high street, and our 20 best food books of the year, thousands of delicious words for you to digest.
And what with Roy Hudd showing us his Life on a Plate while playing Mother Goose at Wilton’s Music Hall, and lunch with our old friend Monty Don, we have something of Christmas cracker to share with you. So it just leaves me now, on behalf of the entire team, to wish you all peaceful and delicious Christmas, and to hope for the very best for the year to come.
Fat chips with feta at Gazi, Melbourne:
chosen by Nigella Lawson, food writer and broadcaster
If I tell you that the best thing I ate this year was in January, please don’t think that the rest of my eating year has been a disappointment: know that I would never allow that to be the case. I have a big thing about chips. Whenever I go out, I ask if the chips I see on the menu are hand-cut. I’m nearly always told they are; they invariably aren’t. That’s no good – I’m not interested if they’re triple-fried in goose fat if they’re not hand-cut. It’s all about the rough edges, you see.
Now, I have to say I didn’t oversee how they cut the chips at a restaurant called Gazi in Melbourne when I was there in January, but they taste like the real thing – but different. They’re fat chips that are halfway to potato wedges, fried in intensely garlicky oil and, once crisp and golden, tossed in a bowl with proper Greek dried oregano and crumbles of sharp feta. It’s impossible not to eat well in Melbourne (well, in Australia generally), but these chips were absolutely worth flying the 10,496.05 miles for.
Scallops with truffle puree at the Clove Club, London
Gregory Marchand, chef-patron, Frenchie, London
This was really fresh, really beautiful and really, really tasty. The scallops came with a dashi jelly, mandarin juice, chopped hazelnuts and a brown-butter dressing, with some raw chestnut mushrooms shaved on top. Everything in the meal was stunning – the duck with fermented red cabbage puree was another standout – but this was the dish with the biggest wow factor. I still remember the experience of eating it.
Earlier this year, a few of us from Morito went to Istanbul. We had some amazing food but the most interesting thing was a dish we ate at a fish restaurant in Uskudar, right next to the Bosphorus, called Ismet Baba. The dish is balık pastırması: swordfish cured with pastırma spices, so lots of fenugreek, chilli flakes, cumin and caraway. Even though I cure fish myself, I had never eaten it in this way before. Then, a few months later, I went to Crete and had a very similar dish. I couldn’t believe the coincidence. So I got to work and tried to replicate it – and I did it quite successfully. Now it’s on our seafood menu. I’ve turned it into a salad with capers, cherry tomatoes and some boiled baby potatoes, but in Turkey and Crete they just served it on its own with a little olive oil.
I don’t know if it’s a nostalgic thing, because his restaurant is about to close, but the best thing this year was Pierre Koffmann’s squid bolognese. It’s a mindblowing dish. He’s taken the idea of spaghetti bolognese, but there’s no pasta involved. What you do is freeze the squid in a vacuum pack bag in one big block, then slice it very thinly on a meat slicer, which creates a kind of tagliatelle effect. The bolognese is the tentacles cooked in a rich tomato sauce. Some of the most ingenious things in life are the simplest. You can’t take it out of the man, he just keeps creating.
In January, I went to Sri Lanka and stayed at a tropical plantation in the south called Samakanda. One evening some local chefs climbed the trees in the garden, harvested some coconuts and tender baby jackfruit and made a curry. I’d never eaten jackfruit before and I’d been staring at these spiky green fruit in the sky wondering what they’d taste like. They cooked the jackfruit in a clay pot over an open fire with onions, ginger, spices, coconut milk and a very sour ingredient called goraka. As you never just get one dish in Sri Lanka, we also had an aubergine and mustard pickle called brinjal moju, a cashew-nut curry, sambal and spiced rice, all washed down with an arak sour. But the jackfruit curry stood out: the sticky sweetness of the fruit was balanced by the sourness of the goraka, and together they cut through the creaminess of the coconut. It was a sensational dish.
Cured and smoked jowl at Pitt Cue, London
Sarit Packer, chef-patron, Honey & Co and Honey & Smoke, London
Itamar and I used to get takeaways from Pitt Cue’s little place off Carnaby Street but we wondered how it would translate to a big restaurant in the City. We thought they might go for something over-sleek but they haven’t – it’s not frou-frou and the food was really simple. They did this smoked jowl which was literally the piece of meat on a plate, with a lick of puree. It was proper proud cooking, as if to say, we know we can do this amazingly well so you don’t need anything else. And it was fun to see people being really creative with smoke.
My wife made me a cake for my birthday in April. It’s called a petit-beurre cake, after the French biscuits (which are very popular in Israel), and it’s the most delicious thing in the universe. I used to have it when I was little. My wife knows it’s one of my kryptonites: she made me a whole tray and I ate half of it by myself. It’s basically a layer cake with vanilla cream and these biscuits, then you add shaved chocolate on top and then the biscuit becomes all mushy and nice. It’s simple, it’s trashy, but it’s so good.
This summer, I went to a tiny little Mayan village called Yaxuna in the Yucatán peninsula and had cochinita pibil. It’s a very traditional dish made with a little pig, usually wild, that they hunt and then marinate in the seed of the achiote tree mixed with sour orange juice. It’s then folded in banana leaves and cooked in a pit. We ate it in 35-degree heat with fresh tortillas, which Mayan women made on hot stones, accompanied by pickled onions, fresh coriander and habanero chillies (as a pale gringo, I could only have a few drops of the chilli marinade). The meat was moist and juicy and the acidity was just incredible. It was such a perfect mouthful – the best Mexican food I’ve ever had.
Bone-marrow arancini by Jacob Kenedy at the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery
Bee Wilson, food writer and historian
At the Oxford Food Symposium, which I’m the chair of, we always have themed meals, and this year the theme was offal. A lot of people thought it was going to be dreadful, but Jacob Kenedy, chef-patron at Bocca di Lupo, put together a total feast – one of those meals I’ll remember all my life. The level of thought he put into it was just extraordinary. There was a lot of wordplay on the menu: it included ox-heart tomatoes, marrow-fat peas and kidney beans. He served red mullet livers, which he’d been stockpiling for months at the restaurant, with bruschetta and peas. He made coda alla vaccinara, or Roman oxtail stew, and an extremely spicy stew of innards called u morzeddhu. But the thing that really stood out for me was an arancino (stuffed rice ball). I’m not often a fan – I think they can be quite dry and disappointing compared to risotto – but this was a beautiful golden sphere, so saffrony, and when you opened it up it had bone marrow in the middle. It was so unctuous – sort of like having risotto Milanese with osso bucco all in one tiny, perfect element.
Black rice with squid ink at El Pirata of Mayfair, London
Fred Sirieix, general manager, Galvin at Windows, London
El Pirata of Mayfair is a lovely Spanish restaurant next to where I work. It’s a traditional, no-frills tapas place that’s been open for 22 years – if it were French it would be a bistro. The dish I love there is black rice with squid. They cook the rice in squid ink and a little bit of fish stock and it has a very delicate round flavour. I love the langoustine with tomato sauce, too, and breaded monkfish – oh, it’s delicious. And such good value. I said to the manager, “Are you mad?” He said, “Fred, people like these prices and we’re happy, too, we don’t need to put the prices up.” OK, fine by me. Oh, and the ham, I think it’s the best that you can find in London. Don’t take my word for it, go and try it out.
Pan-fried cep with celeriac puree and shaved truffle at Timberyard, Edinburgh
Gill Meller, Head chef at River Cottage and author of Gather
Timberyard is a family-owned restaurant – the father, mother, daughter and two sons are all involved and they were incredibly welcoming. One particular dish in the six-course lunch bowled me over. The chef had received a delivery of fresh ceps that morning. He’d taken a thick slice from the middle of the mushroom and pan-fried it on both sides with salt and pepper, then served it warm with a tiny bit of celeriac puree and shaved truffle. Every mouthful was exceptional, partly because the mushroom was so fresh and pristine. It was the simplest dish you could imagine, but the way it was executed was just perfect.
In September, I went to stay with my sister who lives in Beijing. She was obsessed with watermelons, which are absolutely gargantuan in China – bigger than a beach ball. They’re so big, you need help in the supermarket to put it into the trolley, and we had to carry our one home in a pram. The heart of the watermelon is the best bit. It was such a different texture to anything I’ve ever experienced in the UK or America: the flesh was like sugar crystals. I just chopped it up and ate it by itself. It was so sugary and sweet, I couldn’t stop eating it.
Duck breast with blackcurrant at Birch, Bristol
Stephen Terry, chef-patron of the Hardwick, Abergavenny
The couple who run Birch, Sam Leach and Beccy Massey, are young and very passionate. They grow a lot of the produce themselves, make their own bread, do their own butchery. The food is very simple and the place is unpretentious, which appeals to me – they’re clearly putting their money into quality ingredients rather than fine china. We went in the springtime and every dish was a celebration of the season: we had some early rhubarb, we had snails. But the best thing was duck with blackcurrants and roasted carrots. It was the most amazingly cooked duck breast I’ve had in my life. I asked if he’d cooked it in a water bath and he said, no, just in the pan. It was beautiful.
This summer I went hiking in the Swiss Alps. One day we walked for 12km, a lot of it uphill, and then came down into a valley where we found a little cafe that looked a bit like a shed. They made just a few dishes and one of them was homemade spätzle with cream, bacon and local cheese. I had it with a big glass of beer. Maybe it was the circumstances – I was really hungry from the long walk – but this dish was so good. It wasn’t a foodie thing at all: it felt like the world hadn’t touched this place for a long, long time. But it made me really happy.
It was in Paris this spring, at a small bistro called Le Baratin, that I had the best dish ever: veal brain, poached and seared, with lemon sauce and some small boiled potatoes. I love simple, home-cooked food and this was just spot on – unbelievably delicious and cooked to perfection. Le Baratin is a tiny place in Belleville, not fancy at all. There’s an open kitchen and you can see the chef [Raquel Carena] working away, with just one other cook, while her husband manages the bar and front of house. She makes the kind of food I want to eat every day. I’d like to go back very soon.
None of the best things I ate this year involved luxury ingredients but they all had an emotional quality, which is very important to me. A few months ago I had a pumpkin tortelli at Dal Pescatore, not far from Modena, which reminded me of my youth and the flavours of my grandmother’s cooking. It is savoury, spicy and sweet, so you have this feeling that you’re almost eating a dessert at the pasta course. Maybe the pasta was more refined and the plate more elegant, but otherwise it was exactly like my grandmother made it. As soon as I tasted it, I was so emotionally touched, because it took me back to the memory of my youth. It was unbelievable: I almost cried.
My dad has a starfruit tree in his backyard in Bangladesh and when we were over there last month it was in season, which I was very excited about. My relatives were all laughing at me because they think starfruit is a nuisance – they don’t really eat them because they’re so tart, and when they become sweet they disintegrate very quickly. But it was such a treat to see them growing in abundance, and for the kids to pick them. They couldn’t see where the star was, but then we sliced one up and they saw it and were like, “Ah, that’s really cool.” I’d never cooked with starfruit before, but me and the kids dug a hole in my dad’s front garden (which he doesn’t know about because we filled it up afterwards) and took an old piece of metal mesh from my uncle’s building site and built a fire. Then we grilled the starfruit with cinnamon and sugar, and ate it with all the kids in the village. We were just making it up as we went along, using whatever we had in the cupboard, but it was so good. Grilled starfruit, I can tell you, is really delicious.
Roast Dexter ribeye
April Bloomfield, chef-patron, the Spotted Pig and the Breslin Bar & Dining Room, both New York
Few things blew my mind this year, but one that did was this lovely beef I had at my friend Charlie Hart’s farmhouse in Cornwall. He cooked us a Dexter ribeye roast with all the trimmings – lots of roast potatoes and vegetables – and it was all delicious, but the joint was the standout. Boy, was that thing beefy: the fat was the colour of good butter and the meat so tender and tasty. It was one of those moments where you have a connection with what you’re eating – it kind of grabs you, stops you in your tracks, and makes you go, “Whoa, that’s perfection!”
Take a snapshot of “Nordic” cuisine right now, and people are still doing the kind of stuff René Redzepi was making five or six years ago. But what the guy himself is cooking these days, you can’t call it Nordic. It’s unique. This dessert blew my mind. I had it in August, when I was in town for the Mad festival, and, like all René’s food, it looks stunning. It comes on a bed of moss with slices of chocolate-covered dehydrated cep, which were amazing in their own right, but this lichen was something else: it’s deep-fried, sprayed with chocolate and flavoured with, at a guess, pine oil. The first thing that hits you is the texture – it’s like the most delicate Shredded Wheat imaginable – then all these flavours hit you all at once. It’s incredible. I went back six weeks later, just to have it again.
I went to Fäviken at the end of the summer and the whole dining experience was incredible. First, we sat at a log fire for aperitifs and snacks. Then we went upstairs and had a procession of courses – we probably ate 30 different things, though it didn’t feel like a heavy meal. Everything was good but there were a few standouts. One was the most amazing plump scallop that was cooked on a big wood fire in the middle of the kitchen. They remove the skirt, then pour the juice back into the shell and serve it on some juniper wood. It’s just a scallop – so simple – but it was the most succulent sweet thing. Towards the end, we went back down to the fire and they handed out a wonderful selection of sweets, petit fours, coffees and homemade drinks. Afterwards, we went out to a tipi to smoke cigars and drink cognac.
The best all-round eating experience remains Riley’s Fish Shack in Tynemouth and, having come so late in the year, it’s unlikely to be beaten. But the best single food item has to be the whole peking duck at Alan Yau’s homage to the famed dinner-dance clubs of Shanghai, Park Chinois, just off London’s Berkeley Square. Is it cheap? God no. It’s £85, though that’s for two at least. But blimey, it’s good: crisp lacquered skin, the perfect thin layer of fat, sweet yielding meat. It’s been said that the Chinese are the best at roasting duck. And this is quite simply the very best of the best. It could be more expensive. For £280 they’ll bung on 50g of beluga caviar, but I really wouldn’t bother.
Before we opened the new Som Saa, the team went on a research trip to Thailand. For me, the meal at Bo.lan was the highlight of the entire visit, and this curry stood out even among all the other sublime dishes. It had sweetness from fresh coconut cream and this amazing artisan palm sugar that tastes a bit like a combination of butterscotch and honey, and that’s balanced by the slight bitterness of fresh cassia and the fragrance of fresh makrut lime leaf. The beef was pretty special stuff, too – aged rump grilled until it was all smoky. When you’re just off a flight from the UK and eat here, it smacks you square in the face – all those familiar Thai tastes and ingredients are turned up to 11, because they’re fresh from the market that morning.
Bakè is the kind of place that proves you shouldn’t judge on appearances. It’s behind a semi-deserted shopping centre on the outskirts of a quiet seaside town in Puglia – the only thing missing is tumbleweed – but you walk in and the place is packed: they had to bring in an extra table and move everyone around to make room for us. The owner’s a bit of a local celeb – he invented the pentolo pan, for cooking large amounts pasta – but he’s best known round these parts as a truffle hunter. It’s a short menu: three or four pastas, a few mostly fishy mains, and a selection of antipasti, of which this dish was one. It’s so simple: incredibly fresh cuttlefish sliced very thinly, then flash-fried and dressed with brilliant olive oil and summer truffles. The combination was staggering.
Reuben sandwich at Black Axe Mangal, London
Tim Siadatan, chef/co-owner, Padella and Trullo, both London
I’ve eaten at Black Axe Mangal a lot in the past year – well, it is just 20 metres down the road from Trullo. Everything Lee Tiernan and the BAM team cook is excellent, but their take on the Reuben is the best I’ve ever had. Everything in it – and I mean absolutely everything – is made in-house: the smoked pastrami, the brisket, the welsh rarebit mix for the cheese, the sauerkraut, the pickles and even the mustard. And it’s all served in a homemade flatbread with a side of homemade crisps. It’s totally awesome.
What with opening the new Pitt Cue and Coombeshead in 2016, I haven’t had many meals out this year. Even so, there have been many memorable morsels along the way, and perhaps the most satisfying came during a dinner we held at the farm with Nathan Outlaw. I hadn’t eaten much all day, and was running mostly on fumes and the occasional Malteser. After we sent out the main courses, there was a short respite before dessert, so I nipped out to the prep area, where we’d moved the spent roasting trays. Some of Nathan’s sweet, buttery, smoky lobster roasting juices were still in the trays, so I liberated a few slices of bread and took care of things. Roasting and resting juices are my holy grail, and these were some of the finest.
Farokh’s day job is at St John Bread & Wine in London, but on the side he runs these brilliant Persian and curry pop-ups – he’s done a couple for us up at Sticky, but I’m on-duty there, so only get a small taste. I had these brains in October, when he did a guest night at Black Axe Mangal in Highbury. He serves everything family-style, and you just dive into this amazing feast. These massala-spiced brains came with a wonderful tarragon mayo, and I must have eaten at least five of them all by myself – and I mean whole ones. We sometimes have brains on the menu at our places, but Farokh’s spicing takes them to another level.
In May, I went to Italy with my girlfriend for five weeks and we must have had two ice-creams a day while we were there. We went to a couple of off-the-beaten-track places that were highly recommended, with an old man crushing pistachios with his bare hands or whatever, and to be honest they were underwhelming. The best was at a chain called Grom. I know being into a chain is very anti-foodie, but it was really amazing ice-cream. The one I remember most clearly was the first one I had: coffee and pistachio in a branch in Milan. I couldn’t believe that a coffee ice-cream could taste like that – so dark and bitter but sweet as well. It was wonderful. In every town we went to after that, we’d go to Grom.
In September, I went to Mexico for a week, and spent three days in Malinalco learning about barbacoa – and no, it’s not the same as barbecue. The guy smeared a glorious paste of herbs, spices and about 10 types of chilli all over half a lamb, then laid it on a rack over a big pot filled with chickpeas, carrots, tomatoes, onions, herbs, spices, chillies and water, so the fat would drip through. He covered the meat with agave leaves, put the pot in a hole filled with smouldering charcoal, covered everything with hay and left it. The next day, about 16 hours later, we had the soup from the pot, then the lamb with tacos and … Oh my god! Even though I was full, I just couldn’t stop eating. It was my idea of heaven. And the guy still refused to tell me what was in his paste.
A few months ago, Russell Norman (Polpo) took a bunch of us over to Venice for a few days. We went to All’Arco the morning after a lovely, but very long, night on the town. It’s a bacaro near the Rialto, and while the others were chatting away over yet more drinks, I sat quietly at the bar and got stuck into the cicchetti. My memory’s a little hazy, for obvious reasons, but three stood out: one topped with sea bass ceviche with oil and chilli, another with fontina, prosciutto and swiss chard, and these little squares of bread spread with glorious butter and topped with a single salted anchovy. That’s all there was to it, but it was just the best.
Kanei is in an unassuming house in a quiet residential neighbourhood. We were lucky, because we got to the front of the long queue just before they shut the doors – there are only 16 or so seats on the tatami, so it’s pretty cosy. The four schoolboys next to us all seemed to know what they wanted and ordered straightaway, while this old guy sat behind us told me he’d been eating here for 10 years. We had cold soba noodles with a rich, hot duck broth with three slices of pink duck breast floating in it. You dip the super-bouncy soba in the broth, and slurp. This dish was so simple, yet every part of it hit the spot and was so elegant. OFM
Steamed flower crab, Tasting Court, Hong Kongcorrect
Fuchsia Dunlop, cook and writer of Land Of Fish And Rice
My dish of the year was steamed flower crab with golden chicken oil and Shaoxing wine, served on a rippled bed of smooth rice pasta. It was part of an exquisite Cantonese feast arranged by friends. Every dish was prepared with consummate artistry, among them lion’s head meatballs and a perfect rendition of an old classic, braised pomelo skin with dried shrimp eggs. I think it’s the best Cantonese meal I’ve ever had, and the steamed crab was the highlight. Unforgettable.
Last winter, during a trip to Singapore, I had the best chicken in my life. The chicken itself was a 2kg free-range chicken of the very best quality. It was poached for 30 minutes in a gigantic pot full of chicken stock that I suspect had been cooking for decades and had been passed on from chef to chef, just like a sourdough is passed on from one generation to another. After 30 minutes, the chicken was taken out of the stock and put straight into water with ice to seal the melted fats and juices under the skin. The chicken was then kept at room temperature. The rice itself was cooked in chicken fat and then in chicken stock, and served with a black thick soy-like sauce and a chilli sauce made from freshly pounded chillis, ginger juice, garlic, lime juice, sesame oil and sugar. When the chicken melted in my mouth, tears came to my eyes.
The nation’s favourite gardener on his bond with the subject of his current book – his pet dogs – and why he won’t be appearing on TV shows with ‘celebrity’ in the title
I don’t remember eating with Mum or Dad. Dad wasn’t around in Croydon, then Mum died while I was evacuated out in Maidford. Afterwards Gran managed to bring us up on her £2 and 15 shillings pension and still found spare coins for seats at the Croydon Empire every Tuesday evening. I remember seeing Dick Whittington there and then impersonating a cat for the next fortnight – lapping my milk from a saucer, taking my meals under the kitchen table, on all fours. And Gran never batted an eyelid. People would say “Roy’s half daft” and she’d say “Well, I like him”.
The ingredients of the firm yet gooey slosh which the great clown Charlie Cairoli used in “the messiest kitchen scene in history of panto” was top secret. When I was on the bill with him at Leeds Empire, he’d have it made each day in a locked basement room. But I managed to collect a sample and take it to my brother, an analytical chemist. Yet when he opened the box it had evaporated completely. So I spent a lot of time mixing and cooking up my own perfect slosh and then dyed it brown because when two gallons are tipped down my trousers and it trickles out at the ankles the kids especially appreciate the colour. Nowadays, I do a kitchen scene even messier than Cairoli’s, I promise you.
I adored condensed milk as a kid. I’d knock back a whole tin in one, if I could get my hands on it. Years later, when I was doing national service, I was “on jankers” [restricted privileges because of a military offence] one Christmas and the guys in the guard room brought me a present in lovely wrapping and bound with holly. When I opened it, I discovered a tin of condensed milk. I think that was the nicest present I’ve ever received.
I’ve got thousands of books about music hall and tons of old lyrics and sheet music. A favourite composer-comedian is Harry Champion, who’s best known for Any Old Iron but wrote many great songs about food, includingLet’s Have a Basin of Soup, A Little Bit of Cucumber, Baked Sheep’s Hearts Stuffed With Sage and Onion, Standard Bread, Toasted Cheese on Toast, Hot Meat Pies, Saveloys & Trotters, Oh! That Gorgonzola Cheese and Put a Bit of Treacle on my Pudding, Mary Anne. Lovely.
When I was courting my wife Debbie, I’d often say: “Come back with me and I’ll make you something to eat.” It was always the same meal – a Fray Bentos steak and kidney pudding and Angel Delight. When we had a big wedding anniversary this year, I phoned the hotel restaurant and arranged for them to ignore her order and serve Fray Bentos and Angel Delight instead. Debbie thought it was great.
My weight went up to 20 stone, partly because of diabetes, and my doctor said: “You’ll never lose enough unless you have a gastric sleeve fitted.” So I did. And with a smaller stomach I didn’t have much appetite any more and I got down to 13 stone. Now I feel like a million dollars. Seafood, in small portions, is my thing. I love prawns, shrimps, cockles and everything except snot-like winkles and – oh gawd – jellied eels. I call jellied eels “the Battenberg cake of the fish world”, because I once ate Battenberg in a cafe on a day trip to Margate and was so ill afterwards that I’ve never been near a slice since without feeling bilious.
It’s off-beat lines I’ve liked the most. Bob Nelson from Burnley, who could catch a cannonball on his back, would ask the audience “Aren’t plums cheap?” out of nowhere. Slapstick-wise, I got on like a house on fire with Mr Pastry, a children’s entertainer and acrobat who taught me to fall backwards off a dining chair without killing myself. He gave me a Parker pen inscribed with “Thank you for a great performance – Mr Pastry”. Which some bastard stole when I was doing the clubs.
In a boy’s club, doing Aladdin in 1952, I got the idea of boring a hole in the bottom of a teacup and attaching a drainage tube, so I could pour tea endlessly into it from a giant teapot. It was a huge thrill, to find a mechanical piece of business that got such a laugh. Later I got asked to do Quick Brew’s commercials. They went on for some years and paid for my house. When I lost the job I told the wife: “We’re drinking Twinings from now on.”
I had one theatrical landlady who served beans and toast, every bloody night. Come Christmas Eve, after staying at the theatre until 2am, I got back, incredibly hungry and exhausted, and I heard the landlady’s slippers padding up the corridor and sure enough she was carrying beans on toast. I felt a bad red mist come over me. But I picked at the beans andunderneath the beans I found one chipolata sausage. I said, “Hold on there, I think you’ve made a mistake. There’s one small chipolata here”, and she said, “Yes, happy Christmas!”

High above me, veiled in a freezing mist, a woodsman is climbing up 
 a colossal spruce in the name of Anglo-Norwegian relations. I’m in the depths of Oslomarka, a network of coniferous forests on the edge of Oslo where, every year since 1947, a tree has been felled, to be shipped to London and presented as the Trafalgar Square Christmas tree. There it will stand, decorated in traditional Norwegian style, until 6 January. The “Queen of the Forest” (as locals call it) is given in gratitude for Britain’s assistance during the second world war. This year’s chosen one is 27 metres tall, weighs some 4 tonnes and is 95 years old. Oslo is surrounded by natural beauty; edged with woodland and a fjord, it is often described as “the blue, the green and the city in between.” It feels truly wild, populated with moose, lynx, roe deer and even the odd wolf. “Two wolves live out here now,” says Oslo mayor, Marianne Borgen. “They are not hunted, they are welcome.”
Locals love the proximity of the countryside. “In the winter, you can take your skis, get on the tram and be on the slopes in 20 minutes – and be back easily for city life in the evening,” says Borgen, as we warm ourselves with cups of Norwegian coffee. “You can walk around for hours without meeting anyone.”
Or try out a range of winter activities – hiking the many trails, mountain biking, ice skating, fishing, picnicking and, of course, skiing and tobogganing the timeworn runs. If you don’t want to head straight back to Oslo, you can stay in municipal sports cabins, very reasonably priced, and scattered throughout the woods.
More than 80% of Oslo inhabitants visit the forest, says head forester Jon Christiansen. “My father used the forest, my grandfather, my great grandfather.” Christiansen’s team scours the area, talent-spotting trees for London: the chosen few are then groomed like X Factor hopefuls to encourage a strong and symmetrical growth. “We mark it and we tend them through the years,” he explains. “The most important thing is to clear the space around so it gets light from all angles.”
Standing on a snow-fringed track, we are surrounded by trees and ice. A half-frozen lake cracks and creaks, cubist rock forms jut out of the earth, and in every direction legions of pines dissolve into the white haze.
A 20-minute trip back into the city, and I’m sheltering from the rain in the National Gallery. I find familiar compositions of mossy boulders and sopping wet firs in the pen and watercolour works of 19th-century romantics Johan Christian Dahl and August Cappelen. The forest was also a muse to Edvard Munch, who created etchings and paintings of vampires creeping about in its shadows.
From the city the T-bane train takes me north. It’s like getting from the Strand to the Cairngorms in 10 tube stops. I arrive at the Holmenkollen Park Hotel, north-west of Oslo and the unofficial gatehouse to the forest. Built in 1894 as a sanitarium, this fairytale mansion typifies Dragestil – dragon style – which blends medieval stave church architecture and Viking woodcraft. The hotel’s planed-log interiors and pointed tower will soon feature in the film of Jo Nesbo’s The Snowman.
The following morning, the sky is cobalt blue and the air is sharp. Emboldened on a breakfast of rye toast and brunost – sweet brown cheese – I brave it to the top of the Holmenkollen ski jump. Looming dramatically behind the hotel, its launch platform is 200ft above the ground and delivers a knee-trembling panorama, from the crystal waters of the fjord to the rolling green woodland. Up in the Norse gods the view is humbling, almost spiritual.
Beneath the jump is the Ski Museum, which provides a good introduction to Norway’s national sport. There are skis made in 600AD, examples of trugers (snow shoes for ponies) that look like giant bagels, and a wind-force machine that can simulate the effect of a downhill slalom. And the museum’s stuffed elk is a masterpiece of taxidermy.
Leaving Holmenkollen, I set off on a two-mile ramble towards Frognerseteren, once a mountain dairy farm and now a popular restaurant. This is where the forest really takes over. Decent walking boots and thick socks are essential. The few hikers I encounter are sporting some serious kit. An ice-runner darts past with a fleeting “Hei-hei” as I continue on, tentatively, up the hill. The constant tinkle of streams is the only other sound.
During the winter, walkers need to keep an eye on the time, as dusk sets in about 4pm. For Christiansen’s foresters, the challenge is to manage this terrain in a way that pleases the public. Visitors want a scar-free and diverse landscape, with trees of “all ages and all sizes at the same spot”, rather than the uniform vistas created by commercial forests.
Arriving at Frognerseteren, I look back over the treetops to Oslo’s outlying homes. There is constant pressure from property developers to impinge on these woods but 
 Mayor Borgen is determined it won’t happen. “We don’t want to build,” she says, simply. “We want to secure this for the people.”

In my early 20s I was a fashion editor at Elle and I used to go to her shop in the south of Paris. She was married to Sam Rykiel then who was a very nice man and the father of the two children she had. She was already known, quite well established and I didn’t approach her because I was shy and young and on a magazine. She looked at you in quite a hard way and when I entered the shop I would worry when her eyes were upon me – maybe my tights were ripped or something.
She was more a friend of my first husband, [French publisher] Christian Bourgois, but I would see her at the Café de Flore sometimes. She used to go there for lunch very often. She would be upstairs and I would see her across the room. She created a hamburger without bread there and they put it on the menu in her name; Le Club Rykiel [It’s still there: “Sans pain ni mayonnaise avec ketchup et moutarde. €19.50”].
Her daughter worked with her a lot and a great thing that happened in her life, a beautiful thing, was that her son, who is blind, became a great musician. She was very brave with that child.
Her approach to fashion was quite realistic. She understood women and she wanted them to be happy and to look beautiful. We don’t have the same style you know, she is maybe more couture, more fun, more luxury, than me. She was a good designer, yes. She was “Madamoiselle Tricot’ – Miss Knitwear”. She was very good for knitwear. She was quite a figure on Saint-Germain-des-Prés. She always had a shop there and she lived not far away. She created a Parisian style I think and she has been copied a lot.
This article was amended on 11 December. Christian Bourgois was incorrectly spelled Christian Bourgeois. This has now been corrected
For the BBC’s 100 Women season, on Thursday, 5 Live got 100 women on air. Not all at once (no room in the studio), but over the course of the day. Of course, 5 Live has women on air a lot – most Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays it has a female host or co-host from 5.30am to at least 7pm – but there are other audio slots apart from presenters and correspondents. Experts. Callers. Guests. By mid-morning we’d heard from several. “We’re on to 53, and it’s only 11 minutes past 11!” said Emma Barnett, on 5 Live Daily. Her show packed in the females, from 90-year-old Holocaust survivor Kitty Hart-Moxon to MP Luciana Berger to Caitlin Moore, aged 16, who stood in as guest editor. Girl guide Moore was in, and on, from the show’s beginning to end, an amazingly positive young person whose contributions were interesting and relevant. She’d never been on the radio before (unsurprising, as she’d usually be at school), but she proved herself a pro.
Phone-in shows are often tricky when it comes to gender equality: for some reason, women don’t ring in. But at the start of the show, Barnett asked for first-time callers, and we got some jolly female newbies, such as the lady who worked in the fish industry. “Women work in a man’s world because we have to, two people need to bring in a wage,” she said. “I don’t mind working in a man’s world, as long as I can be a woman in it.” What was refreshing was the natural articulacy of most of those speaking, the vibrancy in callers who weren’t making a political point. By the late afternoon, Anna Foster and Tony Livesey could announce that the number of female speakers was up to 76. The news, too, had a “female” slant, which seemed odd at first. Stories about the banning of junk-food adverts aimed at children, or on the increase of women taking exercise, are traditionally deemed “soft” news. They are long-term stories, rather than immediate ones, and, to this hardened (and clearly prejudiced) hack, oddly un-newsy. Still, it was a relief not to be confronted by the shenanigans about Trump or Brexit every other minute.
Another pro-female idea: Radio 4’s Women Talking About Cars. Presented by the charming Victoria Coren Mitchell, this is an odd one: part interview, part vehicular rumination. The interviewee is asked to view their life through their cars, from their parents’ to their current motor. Obviously a device, but it’s a patchy one: the first episode, with chatty, confiding Dawn French, worked well, but Olivia Colman, this week, was pricklier. Coren Mitchell asked a couple too many yes/no questions, to which Colman often gave a one-word answer. In both shows I enjoyed it when the conversation expanded a little. Coren Mitchell made a great point about women feeling both safe and adventurous in a car. More of that, please!
And finally, Radio 4 has a new men’s show, presented by Olly Mann, naturally. The Male Room (not The Mann’s Room? Unbelievable) was an interesting, intimate programme, revealing in a way that most men’s shows aren’t. This week the discussion was around inadequacy; next week, anger. A great listen.
This is one of those few moments when the purchase of a scented candle will not cause every one to raise a disapproving eyebrow. It’s cold – candles are hot. The world is miserable – candles are lovely. Your flat smells of sprouts – candles don’t. Make the most of it. This year, festive candles come in all flavours of winter cheer, including Christmas trees, spices and snow itself.

If you’re feeling unsettled by the Brexit/Trump future, consider this: since the 1950s humans have ramped up the pressure on the planet to such an extent that we have very likely propelled ourselves into a new geological epoch – the Anthropocene. Now that’s what geologists call change. The thing that freaks me out is that it’s rarely mentioned.
To unwrap that: for the past 10,000 years or so, we have hung out comfortably in what we call the Holocene epoch. During this period we have been able to rely on the Earth’s systems to dampen the effects of “forcings”. These are different factors that affect the Earth’s climate, such as volcanic eruptions and solar variations.
When the system does well, the Earth’s resilience to these factors is high. But over the past 50 years, our influence has eroded them so rapidly that we humans have become a geological force in our own right, driving us toward the Anthropocene.
Beset by planetary tipping points, we now risk flipping nature into new “operating zones”. Swedish scientist Johan Rockström has mapped out a “safe operating space for humanity” to avoid these disastrous tipping points, distilled into a book, Big World Small Planet.
Climate change is just one of these boundaries. We must transition away from a fossil-fuel world economy in the next 25-30 years, but because our systems are so interconnected, other boundaries, such as ocean acidification and extinction rates, are critical, too.
To curtail these negative trends we need to think differently. Now that the party is over, it’s all about respecting the planet’s boundaries of the Holocene, which after all allowed us to exist happily for many years. There’s no place like home, we need to keep it that way.
Energy harnessed from exercise is a huge untapped resource. At Cop22, the UN’s Global Climate Change Summit in Marrakech, delegates at a green gym provided by the Great Outdoor Gym Company turned their workouts into green watts. Now four outdoor gym machines have been launched which generate electricity as you exercise. The faster you cycle, the quicker you can charge up your phone.

Just when we thought we were going to lose art history A level, the government recently announced a reprieve. As Anish Kapoor said: ‘Art and art history are the study of what inspires and guides the poetic in us.’
Studying art can have a dramatic effect on our brain activity, too. What we know changes how we look at things and this is easy to prove in the art world. Scientists have tracked the movements of an art historian’s eyes: the results show how they scan, fixate and linger on particular points of the canvas reveals their skill and is entirely different to someone with an untrained eye.
We know that every area of expertise changes our view of the world, so why concentrate on art historians? Simply because they are the easiest to study, as they’re often focusing on one static image at a time – unlike film critics, racing drivers or neurosurgeons. This may reassure parents worried about the gravitas of the subject. Now they know that if their children immerse themselves in art history, they will develop such a specialist skill it will produce a  change in their brains. Maybe more government ministers should study it, too.

Clare Hieatt remembers how the idea of moving to a Welsh farmhouse began to take shape. “I saw a photograph by Juergen Teller of a remote homestead, pretty rough and ready, with chickens wandering in and out of the kitchen. I thought: “That’s what I want. Not the sanitised version of country living, with a Range Rover on the drive. We’ll do it properly.”’
Clare and her husband David Hieatt are both originally from Wales – “the Valleys, not the coast” she says – but for the past nine years, this farmhouse near Cardigan has been their home.
Back in the 1990s, she and David used to work in London – “but in our heads, that was only ever short term,” she says. “London was where the work was.” On the side, they set up their own T-shirt brand: “We thought that if we had our own business, we could move back to Wales and take our jobs with us.”
Those home-printed T-shirts grew into the original Howies clothing company. The clothes caught the mood of the moment: an urge to run for the hills wearing ethically made shirts and jeans, even if it was just for the weekend. The Howies’ slogans hinted at the back story of the Hieatts’ move to Wales, along with their daughters Stella, now 17, and Tessa, 14. “Our factory was just along the river so, yes, David would ‘Work hard, canoe home’, says Clare. “People thought it was a bit of a gimmick, but, that was our real life, not just a slogan.”
This farmhouse marked the start of the next chapter of the family’s life. “We sold our share of the company just as this house came up,’ says Clare. With its rabble of outbuildings, this house had the space and wildness they were after.
“In the depths of winter it can be hard up here,” she continues. “That’s when the girls will moan, ‘Why can’t we live in a normal house in town, with radiators and nice fitted carpets?’ But eventually spring arrives, the kitchen door stays open and this place is just beautiful. You can’t help but wonder about the people who worked and lived here, who helped wear a dip into the porch.”
The decor is honest and homespun without a hint of twee. The wood and Welsh slate dining table is by Freshwest Design and the kitchen is made from reclaimed pine and sheets of stainless steel. A large portrait from the Photographers’ Gallery dates from their London days, though now it hangs alongside paintings by local artist Eloise Govier.
Then there are hand-me-downs, like the bake stone that belonged to Clare’s grandmother. “When I was growing up, she lived with us and looked after us when we got in from school,” says Clare. “She’d give us lemon squash and pikelets cooked on that bake stone.” Clare now uses it to cook flatbreads. “When it heats up, I can smell those pikelets all over again. All that butter and sugar must have seeped into it forever.”
The kitchen is also where the Hieatts have dreamed up new work ventures. Their Hiut Denim utility jeans are made up the road, in a unit they can see from their back window. “We discovered that jeans used to be a big industry in Cardigan, until the high street brands took production abroad. That was a eureka moment for us. We could go back to doing what we had done well and help restart a local industry,” says Clare.
Then there’s the Do Lectures Wales, which they hold in their old cow barn. These started as a one-off summer camp and have since expanded, with spin-offs in Australia and America. People come to listen to inspiring speakers, to swap ideas. ‘This is a place that gives you a breathing space. It helps you think about what you want to do next,” says Clare.

According to a recent report, you only need to answer two very simple questions about your childhood to find out your earning potential for your whole life. When you were 10 years old did you live in an urban or rural area? And, secondly, how many non-school books were there in the house: (a) 0-10 or (b) 11 or more?
A study by the World Economic Forum found that, on average, an additional year of education boosts lifetime earnings by around 9%. The study was restricted to those already in, or nearing, retirement. It was also all male, presumably because – in at least some of the countries studied – it was relatively uncommon for women to work full-time in the relevant era. But these gains were not evenly spread: an additional year of education was associated with a 21% gain in lifetime earnings for those with 11 or more books at home, but only a 5% gain for those with 10 or fewer. Furthermore, the gains associated with having more books at home were greater for those raised in the countryside than urban areas.
Of course, we have no idea whether the (then) children actually read those books more than half a century ago. We do know it wasn’t simply that having more books was a sign of affluence. Over 50% of “blue collar” homes were in the 11 books or more category, suggesting that children whose families value books – regardless of income – are indeed able to benefit more from school.

Some of us are stressed. Others are overworked, struggling with the new responsibilities of parenthood, or moving from one flawed relationship to another. Whatever it is, whatever you are going through, there is wisdom from the Stoics that can help.
Followers of this ancient and inscrutable philosophy have found themselves at the centre of some of history’s most trying ordeals, from the French Revolution to the American Civil War to the prison camps of Vietnam. Bill Clinton reportedly reads Roman Emperor and stoic Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations once a year, and one can imagine him handing a copy to Hillary after her heart-wrenching loss in the US presidential election.
Stoicism is a school of philosophy which was founded in Athens in the early 3rd century and then progressed to Rome, where it became a pragmatic way of addressing life’s problems. The central message is, we don’t control what happens to us; we control how we respond.
The Stoics were really writing and thinking about one thing: how to live. The questions they asked were not arcane or academic but practical and real. “What do I do about my anger?” “What do I do if someone insults me?” “I’m afraid to die; why is that?” “How can I deal with the difficult situations I face?” “How can I deal with the success or power I hold?”
There also happens to be a decent amount of advice on how to live under the looming threat of a tyrant (“I may wish to be free from torture, but if the time comes for me to endure it, I’ll wish to bear it courageously with bravery and honour,” wrote the Roman philosopher Seneca). All of which makes Stoic philosophy particularly well-suited to the world we live in.
While it would be hard to find a word dealt a greater injustice at the hands of the English language than “stoicism”— with its mistaken connotations of austerity and lack of emotion — in fact, nothing could be more necessary for our times than a good dose of Stoic philosophy.
When the news media provokes us with overwhelming amounts of information, Epictetus, another Roman philosopher, cuts through the noise: “If you wish to improve, be content to appear clueless or stupid in extraneous matters.” When it feels like people are ruder and more selfish than ever, Marcus Aurelius urges us to ask when we ourselves have behaved the same way – and says that the best revenge is simply “to not be like that”.
When the natural inclination is to focus on achievement and money, Seneca’s reminder to his father-in-law, who had just been removed from a prominent position, rings true: “Believe me, it’s better to produce the balance sheet of your own life than that of the grain market.”
In their writings – often private letters or diaries – and in their lectures, the Stoics struggled to come up with real, actionable answers. They held duty and honour as sacred obligations and they believed that every obstacle they faced was simply an opportunity – to test themselves and be better.
Now Stoicism is finding resonance with new followers. Just last month in New York, a conference called Stoicon was declared to be the largest gathering of Stoics in history.
This kind of philosophy is not an idle pursuit but a crucial tool. As Seneca said, “Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own.”

One of my rules in life is that I say to someone, every day, the words: “I played with Diego Maradona you know.” I have done it every day since I did so, 10 years ago in the first Soccer Aid, and I will do so every day till I die. I have played in a charity game with Pele, too, but Maradona is the Number One for me.
Because of my Scottish background I chose to play for the Rest of the World rather than England, my birthplace. So we spent a week training with the likes of Schmeichel, Desailly, Matthäus, Zola, Ginola and Dunga. Then two days before the game the organisers told us Maradona was coming. Never mind the non-footballers like me, these pros were just as excited. I remember Desailly almost fainting because Maradona said, “Hi Marcel.” “He knows my name!” said Desailly. I replied: “You did win the World Cup, Marcel.”
Our manager was Ruud Gullit and the day before the match at Old Trafford he told me I would be starting. I couldn’t sleep. I got up early. Maradona’s lawyer was up and we had a coffee together when Maradona sent the guy a text saying he fancied going to the stadium for a kick-about. “Do you want to come with us?” the lawyer said. Er, yes. We headed up to Old Trafford and the ground staff weren’t happy about us going on the pitch. In the end they said OK, but only Maradona and I could go on. So I had almost an hour just kicking a ball around with him.
He was “visualising”. He asked me how many people would be there. I told him 72,000. He looked so happy. Then he practised shooting and at one point smashed the ball into the corner of the net and ran around the stadium as if he had won the World Cup final. “What was that about?” I asked him. “Visualisation of the victory,” he said. He just loved the whole thing. We went back to the dressing rooms to get changed and it was one of the most surreal moments of my life… I am talking football in the showers at Old Trafford with Diego Maradona! He has a tattoo of Castro on his calf by the way, so I imagine he is a bit sad right now.
Back at the hotel the other players were so jealous it was ridiculous. He sat next to me on the team bus to the stadium and he was so excited it was fantastic to watch. Gullit had asked me to take my bagpipes to play before we went out and Maradona jumped on the physio table and started dancing. He played the whole 90 minutes – and scored, though we lost 2-1. He still had it. He and Gazza were the two stars, really.
At the end my son Rory said to me: “Dad, you were so out of your depth it was embarrassing.” I said, “I don’t care. I have played in front of a packed Old Trafford with Diego Maradona and I am going to talk about it till the day I die.”

I am going to just come out and admit it, I love poinsettias. I love everything about them. I know they are virtually impossible to grow. I know they are currently in the doldrums of horticultural fashion – “a crime against good taste”, most of my gardening colleagues tell me. Yet to me the childhood memories I associate with their scarlet, holly-shaped bracts get me every time: an instant flashback to my uncle Joe’s barbeque turkey and unwrapping presents beneath a plastic tree when I was a kid in tropical Singapore.
However, as a seasonal winter houseplant in the rather more chilly UK, there are many often overlooked options that just might offer newbies a more practical, maybe even rewarding, alternative. In fact, any of the traditional Christmas favourites, from cyclamen and azaleas to hippeastrums and Christmas cacti will be easier to grow.
This is because poinsettia is a subtropical plant from the wilds of Mexico and very sensitive to cold draughts – such as those in chilly rooms or the icy outdoor florist stands and market stalls from which they are often sold – which can cause their leaves to blacken.
They also hate the dramatic fluctuations in temperature when you bring them in from the cold. They aren’t even particular fans of hot, dry rooms either, as created by modern central heating, which may make them lose their leaves.
If you can avoid all of these factors, you are doing better than me! This leaf shedding might be problematic, too, as their foliage (although not highly toxic as is often claimed) does contain chemical irritants. Perhaps something to avoid if you have kids and pets running around, or maybe keep them off the dining table.
If you are after an easier seasonal houseplant to brighten up your home, pick a citrus or a jasmine. Both will handle chilly temperatures and (paradoxically) warm rooms far better. They are also non-irritant. If you are a good-taste snob, their glossy, dark green leaves and delicate white flowers are failsafe and will work in any decor.
Pick a calamondin orange and your little tree will come studded with tiny mandarin-like fruit, too. Unlike poinsettias, both can live for decades (not mere days) if treated well. Just remember to plant the jasmine outdoors come spring. But for me what really sets both these species apart from all others is the fresh, uplifting scent of their blossom.
They are traditionally believed to have relaxant properties, and there is even a growing body of scientific evidence to suggest that the constituents of these flowers can indeed help calm feelings of anxiety and improve mood. Something that might just come in handy when the relatives arrive.

Temper, 25 Broadwick Street, London W1F 0DF (020 3879 3834). Meal for two, including drinks and service: £100
After dinner at Temper I slept with the smell of dinner in my hair. I stank of wood smoke, rendered animal and testosterone. That’s what restaurants with big, manly smoke pits are like. They leave their mark on your nostrils and your hair and your psyche. I was derailed by the noise and the flames and the beards. Oh, those beards!
Who thought this was a good idea? It’s a rhetorical question. He’s a chef called Neil Rankin, and he’s been doing grandiose things with whole animals and fire for a while now, at both Smokehouse and Bad Egg. He’s remained something of a cult, but this is his shot at the big time in London’s Soho, with big London money, and bravado and punch. There is a menu, but they could just replace it with a massive sign stamped with the word MEAT!, alongside one of those comedy boxing gloves on an extending arm which keeps punching you in the face until you surrender.
You sit on a bar stool, fixed so close to the counter that if you’re over 5ft 9in your knees will be forced back into your body by the lumbar support, and watch sweaty men (and, to be fair, one woman) do things with fire, protein and fat. Lots of fat. They bring in whole carcasses here, butcher them on site, then cook the various cuts over fire. You pay by the 100g for a mixed plate of whatever is ready. The listing for beef, apparently a British White from Essex, says: “Mix of smoked rib meat, neck and shin, leg shawarma & grilled prime cuts.”
And that’s what you get. A plate of stuff from something that once walked and ate grass. Sirloin with a bit of fat. Leg with a bit of fat. Fat with a bit of fat. You try telling one muscle from the other. Only the goat isn’t fatty because they smoke that for nine hours somewhere in a back kitchen. Meat goes on the fire and comes off the fire, its skin the colour of brass coins. Chefs cut away at it to lasciviously reveal the Ann Summers pinkness within. They furrow their brows. Here, a good furrowed brow is a minimum qualifying standard.
There’s other stuff. There’s corn kernels in “lamb fat butter” and “beef fat potatoes” drenched with raclette cheese, which is like a members-only club for saturated fats. To pass the time until the meat comes there are filled tacos, and sauces including something called MSG Ketchup, which sounds like a new model of Volkswagen. And there’s loud music, and meat and fat and smoke, and fat and meat. And smoke. Did I mention the smoke?
It’s enough to make me want to grab a map of London and scrawl “Stop it!” across the sheet in black marker pen. Stop it with your macho posturing, and your Paleo games. Stop pretending you’re all bloody cavemen. It’s 2016 for God’s sake, the age of Uber and Tinder and Miele and Smeg. Are we all so insecure that we have to set fire to trees to prove we’ve got testicles?
And I would do this, really I would, were it not for one thing. Temper is brilliant. Temper is one of the most exciting restaurants to open in London this year. I’m not quite self-regarding enough to think people open restaurants with me in mind. But if they did, the restaurant would be Temper. I love the fact that you can smell the wood smoke and the rendering meat from the door. I love the way that smell stays in your hair. I adore the theatre of the fire pit, the glowing embers and the flash and dance of sparks, and the way they pay so much attention to the roasting joints.
Of course you can ask them for lean cuts if that’s what you want. They’ll do it for you. But why would you? These are pieces of prime animal and they are both muscle and fat and you need the whole story. I had never met Rankin before the night I descended into his basement and sat down on one of his bar stools. But it was as if he understood what would make me happy. (And don’t worry about the tightness of those bar stools; just turn them 180 degrees so you are straddling the back like in that famous Christine Keeler picture, only with clothes on. For us bigger men, it works.) Of course, you could sit at a table and stare at each other but again, why would you?
To start there are those tacos of ground, gravelly corn, loaded with blow-torched mackerel and shavings of fishy, pungent bottarga, and vinegary green sauce, or raw cubes of beef, glazed with sauces of fermented chilli and soy. These are the wake up. Then there are those meats, starting at £5.50 per 100g for the pork, all leg and shoulder and belly with fat like ivory, to £8 per 100g for the beef and topping out at £9.50 for the goat. All come on charred flatbreads, made on site.
There are sauces: that intense ketchup, a salsa of fire-blackened peppers or one of fresh tomatoes. For texture there are little bowls of things like crushed pork scratchings or deep-fried onions or peanut and lime zest. And maybe you won’t ever get to those beef fat potatoes with the slab of stinky raclette but it’s good to know they are there for emergencies. You can have spiced wilted greens if you must.
Witness: a review of two halves, and consciously so for here’s the thing. Sometimes I write positively about a place and people disagree with me. The explanation for the dispute is simple. They are wrong. They have no taste or judgment. Temper is not like that. I don’t think I’ve ever come across a restaurant I so loved, while also recognising that others would have completely valid reasons for hating it. Temper is brash and boisterous and macho and ludicrous – and utterly brilliant. But not everyone has my taste for animal and smoke and theatre and brilliance. You’re adults. Make your own bloody minds up.
One thing though. For dessert they serve a luscious dish of soft-centred chocolate cookie, still hot in its pan, as well as a kouign amann, a kind of croissant-style laminated pastry drenched with butterscotch sauce. If you don’t like those two, if they don’t do it for you, there is only one explanation. On that you really are completely wrong.
If you fancy more wood-smoke action visit John Doe in London’s Westbourne Grove area, though their approach is a little more subtle than that at Temper. Go for smoked venison tartar, ash-roasted leeks with a caper and tarragon dressing and salt marsh lamb (johndoerestaurants.com).
Streetsmart, which raises funds to tackle the problem of homelessness, is once more with us. Diners at 500+ restaurants will be invited to add a donation of £1 to their bill. Last year the campaign raised over £500,000, which went to 30 homelessness charities (streetsmart.org.uk
In Brighton, sushi restaurant Moshimo has secured planning permission for a new space perched on a column 150ft above Bartholomew Square. Meanwhile planning permission has been granted in London for a building, already nicknamed the Trellis, that will house what’s believed will be the capital’s highest restaurant. I may once have advised people never to visit a restaurant that sells itself on the view.

Don’t build your house on the sandy land, they said, don’t build it too near the shore. Except what if you really like the view? Yes it might slip into the sea during the first winter winds, but until then, it’s lovely near the shore. Lemonade sun twinkling off the water as you sit out in the morning with your toast, the gentle plip of waves against the patio. What’s a little death for a life like this?
This is the conclusion I come to when I read the regular urgings to exit my echo chamber. To listen to opposing voices, to read the views of Trumpers and uncles, to pierce our conceited, content bubble. To live in the real world. Which if we’re being clear, I think, means, “one with racists in”. So I come to the conclusion that no, I don’t want to. This cosy echo chamber might not be perfect, but at least it’s home.
I understand the argument. I see what John Oliver meant when he talked about a “healthy media diet”, and when Barack Obama said that fake news online makes it “very difficult to have a common conversation”. I understand the concern that social media algorithms have fragmented society, and that as well as showing you slightly too many kitten gifs they might be destroying democracy. And I’ve felt the shock that comes from believing only what I choose to click on.
I can remember at least three of those dusty mornings waking up to news on my phone that everything I’d thought before had been wrong. Three silent journeys into work, on tube trains of darting eyes asking, “Was it you?” Arguments as computers warm up about whether it’s too soon to joke. Three dawn text messages from my mum, still averse to text language even at times when only emoji will do. Three mornings of stunned surprise that I’d managed to rainproof myself to the extent that I had no idea what half the country wanted, or who they were. But I will say this for rainproofing – it’s cosy.
The walls of our echo chamber are tastefully decorated with limited-edition prints, and drawings by four-year-olds that make us chuckle: “Oh the wisdom of children!” There’s underfloor heating, and from a £20 candle, the smell of figs. We are all very considerate about how each other prefers to be addressed, and nobody buys goods from shops that advertise in the Mail, even if we really want them. Our phones are charged, our hearts are full. A percentage of our incomes goes straight into a charity fund, which means we never feel bad saying no to beggars or when keeping the radiators on at night.
In an echo chamber the acoustics are amazing – our voices sound booming and tremendous, and even the most awful music sounds all right, especially when someone explains why you should like it in a chirpy online review. We are not compelled to debate for sport, to tear apart our long-held beliefs in snappy retorts unless we really fancy a workout. Some of us don’t even have opinions about politics, and that’s OK. The weather in here is always, if not warm, at least of sufficient drama to enable conversation when the communal dining room goes quiet. If news reaches us of a surprise president or explosion of racism, at least we have each other. And every episode of 30 Rock and a massive strudel.
But we have built this place for a reason. They say, educate yourself on the reasons people are rejecting the “elites”. We say, until a word can exist outside of its own quotation marks it is irrelevant. They say we can only feel empathy if we put ourselves in strangers’ shoes. But we end up walking around in bile. They say our problem is that we choose only to listen to voices that validate our own. Their answer seems to be “befriend the people who call you a ‘libtard kike’.”
Rather than an ignorant default setting we find ourselves inhabiting, living in an echo chamber right now is like putting on a jacket before stepping outside. It’s self-care in an unholy storm. And no doubt soon our bubble will be pierced from the outside by a huge bayonet, so until then, until I’m forced to mingle with strangers and argue face to face about what it means to “do the decent thing”, I’m going to tuck myself in with my lovely mates and agree to just… agree.

I’m 32 and struggling with unwanted changes to a much valued friendship. Over the past two years I’ve been rather left behind with a friend who met the love of her life, got married and fully embraced her friendships with her husband’s friends. We spent less and less time together and when we did, she seemed disengaged. It rather broke my heart as I consider her one of my closest confidantes. I suppose at first I dealt with it very badly, getting emotional and confronting her about her “neglect” of our friendship. I would still love to get our friendship back on track. I just don’t know how. Her priority is her husband and the new family they will likely create and I know I can’t turn the clock back. I’m surprised to find teenage feelings resurfacing at my age! But I don’t know how to move on from something I feel so sad about.
Mariella replies People changing – don’t you just hate that? One minute you’re top-to-toeing in a hostel in Bangkok, the next they’re raising a disapproving eyebrow as you celebrate the end of a working week with a second cocktail!
Friends move on and journey in different directions. There’s few of us who don’t have experience of that sad sense of being left behind. That’s why it’s so important not to define your friend’s behaviour as an act of abandonment but just part of a natural pattern. There is no such thing as the status quo when it comes to our relationships, so regarding every change that occurs as an affront is simply not sustainable.
Good friends are part of our support structure, like scaffolding; not always imperative but hopefully available to tap into during times of serious instability. Your girlfriend is at a different stage of life right now, but soon you’ll get there too, or, at some point in the future, she’ll be back in your spare room. That’s the way life works.
The best friendships evolve over time and picking up where you left off should be as easy after a decade as it is after a day. The depth of a friendship can’t be judged by proximity, the regularity of your communication or occasional disappointments, but by your compatibility and the generosity with which you accept each other’s foibles. Celebrating good fortune and sustaining each other in times of trouble is the way to move forward, not stamping your foot and waving your fist when you’re not getting the level of attention you’re used to. If our days panned out on a loop, we’d all be driven crazy, so why is it that when we’re affected by forces we can neither control nor predict, we try to stand firm against fate?
What exactly do you want to achieve by confronting her? Inseparability may be a defining feature of friendship in youth, but in adulthood it’s our ability to let go that matters most. It’s no coincidence, particularly with girls, that so much merchandising is centred on the notion of unbreakable bonds and being best friends forever, forsaking all others until death us do part. T-shirts, necklaces, stickers and posters all perpetrate the mythology around being stuck together like glue.
Such suffocating definitions of friendship occur at a time when we have no clue about what a “lifetime” entails or how our paths will diverge over the decades. In adulthood, being bonded takes on much more onerous connections and most of us would fight hard not to be so irrevocably attached. As we mature so too should our friendships. Experiences become more subjective, fate takes us on different paths, and geographical distance and pesky partners have to be negotiated, too. Navigating that changing terrain means learning to celebrate the ebb and flow of experience, enjoying the periods when your paths converge and learning to stay afloat independently when you drift apart.
Meeting a partner, having children, changing job, moving location are the likeliest occurrences in an ever-changing world. Giving those you love the necessary room to achieve their potential while maintaining a connection are skills we need to become adept at as we mature. Battling Canute style against the tides will only leave you feeling frustrated.
Close-knit pals will inevitably disentangle and find other attachments along the way, but nicely nurtured they’ll remain at arm’s reach, there to reconnect when the time is right and the tides more favourable. The greatest threat to our happiness is often our misplaced determination to control our destiny. We need to learn to be shape shifters, embracing ups and downs, fulfilment and frustration and people who move in and out of our lives.
A hamster on a wheel endlessly treading the same space is the definition of hell, but we should be equally fearful about trying to control the pace of change and where and when it occurs. It’s ironic that the defining feature of all our lives – the inevitability of nothing staying as it is – is what we battle hardest against.

A loud whirring sound emerges from the kitchen at Villa Somis, a high-end Italian restaurant in the hills overlooking Turin. Perhaps it’s a coffee machine, or a prosciutto slicer. But when chef Antonio Chiodi Latini comes out, he’s holding two glasses of light green “vegetable extract”, to wash down our vegan biscotti.
Chiodi Latini is 56, and until three years ago was known in certain local circles for his elaborately presented dishes, such as seafood pasta with edible flowers or perfect cylinders of raw beef. The menu at his new pop-up venture, Chiodi Latini New Food, is no less fancy, but completely free of all animal products.
“My old customers say: ‘It’s amazing how you used to cook, you were good at making fish soup, and lovely meat,” says Latini, who opened for business on the top floor of the elegant villa this summer, having turned vegan himself three years ago for health reasons. “But people want to try new things, and spend an evening eating food that makes them feel good with their own body and soul.”
Turin is famous for cars, football, the winter olympics – and now vegetarianism, after new mayor Chiara Appendino announced plans to turn it into Italy’s first “vegetarian city” earlier this year. Traditional butchers have expressed their horror at the proposals, which include introducing a weekly meat-free day, and teaching schoolchildren about animal welfare and ecology. In my hand, I have the city’s “veg map” for tourists. I’ve come for the tour.
“In Turin, there are now more than 30 restaurants and shops serving vegan and vegetarian food, which for a city this size, is possibly the highest number in Italy,” says Stefania Giannuzzi, the deputy mayor behind the initiative. “We wanted to value and recognise this aspect of the city.”
Vegetarian visitors wandering the streets of the northern Italian city won’t take long to stumble across one of the growing number of new vegetarian delis and cafés. Despite the reputation of the Piedmont region for hearty Alpine fare (one of the most famous local dishes is bollito misto, a stew made from boiled veal, beef and chicken) the choice on offer is impressive.
“Turin has always been at the forefront of things,” says Claudio Viano, who opened the city’s first vegetarian restaurant, Mezzaluna, with his partner Daniele 20 years ago. “Turin and maybe Milan are now the best places in Italy to visit for vegan food,” he says, praising the Slow Food Movement which was set up in the nearby town of Bra.
At L’Articiocc, a café in central Turin specialising in meat-free Ligurian food, a set menu offers three dishes from a selection behind the counter. I go for gnocchi tossed in a delicious red pesto made with ground nuts instead of parmesan, a courgette and quinoa bake and a vegetable focaccia. The dairy-free chocolate and almond torte is less impressive, but Giannuzzi recommends the desserts at another nearby vegan restaurant, Soul Kitchen, instead.
Elsewhere, it’s easy to steer clear of lazy vegan fallbacks tofu and falafel, and try creative adaptations of Italian classics instead. The garlicky mushroom lasagne at studenty café Il Gusto di Carmilla works without its usual heavy white sauce. Even dairy-free pistachio gelato, made with rice milk at an ice-cream shop called Mondello, is surprisingly moreish.
Giannuzzi insists that she is not trying to clash with the city’s meat producers and agricultural associations, who in May organised a barbecue in protest against falling sales and health scares using the hashtag “pork chops to the rescue”. She instead emphasises the environmental benefits of turning vegetarian, citing UN guidelines and the Paris climate agreement as good reasons to cut down on the city’s meat consumption.
So far, finding vegetarian and vegan food in Turin has been easy, but it’s time for the final challenge: can I eat a fully vegan pizza, without having to skimp on cheese and pepperoni? Well, sort of. I’m invited to cool vegan restaurant and bakery Ratatouille by a group of local animal rights campaigners. A small group of them recently staged a protest at a major food festival in the city, dressed up in “human meat” packaging and covered in fake blood.
They excitedly tell me that Radiohead singer Thom Yorke has been spotted in Coox, one of the newest vegan places to open in Piazza Vittorio Veneto, where young people gather each evening for drinks and snacks. “It’s only in the last few years that Turin has changed,” says Monica Schillaci, an activist in her early 30s who was vegetarian until three years ago, when she decided to turn vegan after seeing an animal welfare campaign billboard. “Even a few years ago, you couldn’t get a breakfast as a vegan. But now in almost every bar there are soya milk cappuccinos and macchiatos. And sometimes even vegan pastries.”
We share a fluffy “tegamino”-style pizza, made in a pan, with “vegmozzerella” and Quorn sausage. Vegan cheese remains unappetising wherever you are in the world, but the pizza itself has a particular, mouthwatering taste only found in Italy. Not only do the vegetarians of Turin have the backing of the mayor, they also have Italian know-how. And that combination might just be enough to see the controversial “vegetarian city” project succeed.
Terra Pegoes Branco, Setúbal, Portugal 2015 (£5.99, or £4.99 as part of a mixed case of six bottles, Majestic) I’m going to start my Christmas wine-shopping at Majestic, where, as ever, you need to buy a mixed case of six bottles get the best prices. On my list are two bargain dry whites: Terra Pegoes Branco is light, easy-going, citrus-tangy – a handy party aperitif for under a fiver; Muscadet Pallet 2014 (£11.99, or £9.99 as part of a mixed case) is more serious, with a chablis-like intensity of lemon, minerals, nuts and sourdough bread that shows the potential of this under-rated Loire region and is fine-tuned for festive first courses. For the roast bird, I’m going elsewhere for something a little richer: the multifaceted creamy, herby, orchard-fruity white Rhône gem Domaine Lombard Brézème Blanc 2015 (£19.50, Yapp Brothers).
St-Julien Limited Edition, Bordeaux, France 2010 (£21.95, From Vineyards Direct) If Christmas dinner means claret, then a couple of special bottlings from two of my favourite independent merchants are well worth your attention. From Vineyards Direct has done a deal with one of the best châteaux in Bordeaux’s St-Julien commune (its name is kept secret) for its Limited Edition from the great 2010 vintage – a deep, resonant expression of classic claret cassis, cedar and pencil-shaving flavours that is inviting now but will keep for a good decade or more if you’re looking for a present for a wine-loving relative. Tanners, meanwhile, has sourced its Super Claret (£14.95, Tanners Wines) from the less-regarded 2012 Bordeaux vintage, but it’s a beautifully fresh and crunchy style for the turkey and trimmings in two weeks’ time.
Tenuta di Castellaro Malvasia delle Lipari, Italy 2013 (£20, 37.5cl, Meadow Dale Wines) For candidates for Christmas dinner reds under £10, I’d be moving away from Bordeaux, to the south of France and the supple spiciness of Les Hauts de Saint Martin Saint-Chinian 2015 (£6.99, The Co-op); or to Chile for the delightfully plump red-fruited Tierra y Hombre Pinot Noir, Casablanca 2015 (£8.50, Marks & Spencer). The sweet end of the meal may take me back to Bordeaux for the perfectly poised golden lusciousness of Berry Bros & Rudd Sauternes by Château Doisy-Védrines 2012 (£12.75, 37.5cl, Berry Bros & Rudd), although I’d be very tempted by the delicately exotic floral prettiness and apricots-in-syrup deliciousness offered by Tenuta di Castellaro’s stunning Malvasia, made from dried grapes harvested from seaside vineyards on the Aeolian Island of Lipari near Sicily.
What do a Pacific Islander on an emotional quest, the wilful leader of a small rebel band and a young girl who dreams of learning to fly an eagle have in common? They’re all set to dominate the box office this Christmas.
On the surface, Disney animation Moana, Star Wars spinoff Rogue One and documentary The Eagle Huntress are three very different films. What they share, however, is a sense of indomitable purpose and the ability to move audiences at a time when they are desperately in need of good cheer – and it’s this that looks set to propel them to success.
“We’ve had a lot of girl guides, football teams and high school groups coming to watch the film and the reaction has been amazing,” says Otto Bell, director of The Eagle Huntress, which follows a young Kazakh girl, Aisholpan, as she battles prejudice and bad weather to become the first female to enter the country’s annual Golden Eagle competition. “We had one moment where we came out after Sundance and all these kids who’d seen the film spontaneously started applauding, cheering and shouting her signature eagle-calling shout. It was incredible.”
The intrepid and independent Moana in Disney’s film, who has been described by many critics as an anti-princess, has received a similarly warm response. “What I love about Moana is its focus on a young leader who discovers her inner power and learns to trust herself,” says Anthony Breznican of Entertainment Weekly. “Plus she shows the charming but pompous tough guy, Maui, that brawling isn’t always the best solution to a problem. Brothers everywhere, big and little, should take note.”
Meanwhile, the highly anticipated Rogue One, which opens this week, will see Felicity Jones’s Jyn Erso gather a ragtag band of rebels including Riz Ahmed, Forest Whitaker, Diego Luna and Donnie Yen to take on the might of the Empire – a plotline that has taken on slightly more resonance in the light of recent political events.
So are we seeing the rise of a new kind of heroine? Bell says that what drew him to Aisholpan was “her quiet determination”, and it’s certainly the case that all three women are shown as go-getting leaders. “I see Moana’s story as a classic hero’s journey regardless of gender,” says Osnat Shurer, producer of the Disney animation. “We see her courage and emotional intelligence, her determination and compassion, and it’s a fascinating tale.”
In recent years, Disney has made concerted efforts to move away from its image as the home of sparkling dresses, glass slippers, singing birds and princes swooping in to save the day. Brave was a story about the bonds between mothers and sisters, Frozen a tale of sisterly love and loyalty, and even though Rapunzel and Tiana – the respective heroines of Tangled and The Princess and the Frog – got their men, in neither case was it their main concern.
“I just rewatched Sleeping Beauty and I forgot how passive she is: it’s the fairies and the prince who come to the rescue. Same for Snow White and Cinderella,” says Monica Castillo, film writer for the New York Times. “Starting with the 1990s Disney renaissance, the princesses become more active, peaking with Mulan, who becomes a warrior to take her father’s place in the army. I was thrilled that Tiana had ambitions beyond big ballgowns and the real love story of Frozen was between two sisters. It’s a whole new world from where we started: pretty things to be rescued from witches, dragons and evil stepmothers.”
Moana continues that evolution with a story that’s as much about helping your community as discovering yourself. Most notably, her figure is athletic and strong rather than wasp-waisted and delicate. “She had to look as though she could go on this journey to save her world,” says Shurer. “The way she looks shouldn’t be radical but it’s true that right now it is.” Hawaiian writer Robyn Lucas agrees. “Moana as a Disney princess was not only body-positive, but having her as a darker-skinned/brown girl made a huge impact,” she says. “I was mesmerised watching it, because it was the first time I saw anyone who looked like me on the screen in that capacity – as a leading actress.”
Many fans are also responding to the opportunity to celebrate a brown girl in a leading role. “I loved it – I’ve seen it twice now and think it does a very good job of both harking back to the Disney renaissance and moving the story forward in a progressive way,” says Aisha Harris, culture writer for Slate and the host of that site’s popular podcast, Represent. “There’s no prince, no love interest. It’s a film about a girl and her journey and the heroine is a girl of colour, and that’s so important.”
Daniel Jose Older, author of the acclaimed young adult fantasy Shadowshaper and a new novella, Ghost Girl In The Corner, agrees: “Moana isn’t passive. She’s central to the story and I know from my own inbox how important that is – since I wrote Shadowshaper, it’s been full of brown girls saying they hadn’t felt at home in a book before. It’s a really powerful experience to find yourself at home somewhere without being translated by others. To see that in a Disney movie is huge.”
Nor is it the only example. A recent piece in Vanity Fair quoted Disney as saying that “between 2016 and 2018 about 24% of the studio’s live-action releases will feature ethnic minority leads”. A similar push has been made by Disney-owned LucasFilm regarding female leads – brunette and British ones, at least – with Emilia Clarke from Game of Thrones set to join Daisy Ridley and Felicity Jones in the Star Wars universe.
“The Force Awakens and Rogue One absolutely show that female heroes can carry a blockbuster action-adventure movie,” says Breznican. “Similarly, Moana shows that we can continue to reach beyond the Brothers Grimm. The world is full of amazing folktales and mythology and animated films are just another step in the process of handing these stories to a new generation.”
Not everyone is singing Moana’s praises, however. Disney worked for six years on the film, establishing an Oceanic Story Trust made up of people from all walks of Pacific Islands life, from anthropologists and linguists to master navigators and tattooists. It employed a Samoan musician, Opetaia Foa’i, to co-write the music, and cast two stars with Pacific Island heritage, Auli’i Cravalho (Moana) who is Native Hawaiian and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson (Maui) who is half-Samoan. But some Pacific Islanders remain unconvinced.
“Disney is engaged in a sophisticated form of colonisation,” says Dr Teresia Teaiwa, senior lecturer in Pacific studies at Victoria University of Wellington. “It has very cleverly manipulated some islanders’ deep desire to be affirmed by the dominant culture and it’s now selling this desire back to us. What is most insidious about Moana is that is offers us roles as a comical buffoon on one hand or an adolescent faux-feminist on the other, and distracts us from the deep and rebellious intelligence that is our true inheritance, in this ocean that has been our home for millennia.”
Tina Ngata, a teacher at Te Wananga o Aotearoa, New Zealand’s indigenous university, and a campaigner for indigenous rights, agrees. “Moana has taken a very broad-stroke approach to a very wide area that holds a very diverse set of cultures,” she says. “The film is problematic about many things, from rock-stacking, which is actually a very disrespectful and problematic practice in Hawaii, to Moana’s father banning the village from venturing beyond the reef – which is codswallop, and does not reflect our own world views and likely responses to the event of losing someone at sea.
“Our region has always been an exotic escape that people go to in order to turn their back on stress, and acknowledging distinct mana [rights] is not a part of that experience. A number of whanau [extended families] from islands across the Pacific are genuinely enjoying the movie. All I can say to that is – not all that we enjoy is good for us.”
Shurer remains sanguine. “Everyone has a right to their own opinion, particularly about their own culture,” she says. “My one hope is that people see the film and don’t make their decisions simply based on the trailer.”
Lucas agrees. “Although there were some problems with the film, the makers had clearly done a great deal of research and I understand that you can’t fully get Polynesian culture condensed for a two-hour film.
“I adore Moana because she was smart and yet vulnerable and her relationship with her parents was respectful, which is huge.”
It’s important, too, that the commitment to creating diverse and interesting characters continues. Older says: “It’s great that we’ve got to this point, but we can’t get stuck here. Our world and society are complex and diverse and the stories we tell and are told need to reflect that.”
Moana is out now. Rogue One and The Eagle Huntress are both released this week
A couple of miles outside St Andrews, the Eden Mill whisky distillery has been part of the Fife landscape for more than 200 years. It was founded by the Haig family and the whisky still bears their name. After 50 years, though, the distillery was shut down and converted into a paper mill.
And so it remained until 2012, when Fife businessman Paul Miller decided to return the site to its former glory. His small team of distillers are now famous locally for their pale, chocolate and crystal malt whiskies – which are matured for several years in wooden casks before they are ready to drink.
Therein lies the rub. Because despite its deep heritage, it’s not whisky that’s driving the sales growth, but gin.
In fact, sales of the latter are proving so good that Christmas sales of scotch, a quintessentially festive drink, may well be surpassed by gin for the first time.
“When we started out we thought whisky, we didn’t really give gin a second thought,” Miller said. “But then gin happened.”
Across Scotland independent whisky distillers increasingly favour gin over whisky because it’s quicker and easier to make, and gives them a faster return.
The way gin has muscled in on scotch in its heartland is telling. Some 70% of the gin consumed in the UK is made in Scotland, even though many people think of it as an English drink. In 2010 gin sales, at £774m a year, were about half those of scotch. Today, both are worth about £1.2bn, though by 2020, gin is predicted to soar to more than £1.5bn while scotch sales will stay flat, according to Euromonitor.
“Whisky is fantastic and my distillers love making it,” Miller said. “But with gin, they love the fact that what they are creating can be in a box for Christmas within weeks. They don’t have to wait three or four years for what may or may not be the marginal difference they make to the whisky product.”
Miller’s gin now sells more than all his whisky products put together, making up 80% of total sales. Gin brought in almost £4m this year, and Miller expects that to double in 2017.
“Gin was in the right place at the right time”, said Jonny Forsyth, a drinks analyst at Mintel, who says boutique brands such as Eden Mill have reinvented the market for it. “They’ve come up with a much more contemporary packaging and by using botanical ingredients they also appeal to young people who are really interested in natural products.”
Older brands are having to adapt. Gordon’s, for example, which is owned by drinks giant Diageo, has revamped its bottle for the first time in 15 years. Stephanie Jordan, who manages Diageo’s Tanqueray gin, acknowledges that smaller brands have shaken up the market, but is not overly worried by the competition. “You get some juniper essential oils and a few other things. You pretend you’re a chemist and Bob’s your uncle, you’ve made gin”, she said. “Often there isn’t even distillation involved, which is why so many brands can be launched.”
Jordan believes that half the gin brands coming to market will not be able to survive. Scotch, by contrast, has incredibly strict regulation “which means you don’t get people making it in their garages”.
But is she missing the point? Scott Fergusson, Eden Mill’s head distiller, thinks formerly hardened whisky makers are enjoying their foray into gin, and that won’t stop any time soon. “With whisky, there’s such a long lead-in time. There’s a process, there are ingredients, and you cannot deviate,” said Fergusson, who graduated from St Andrews University with a first in physics.
“Distillers love making gin because it’s almost the reverse. I spend lots of time thinking about recipes that will work, you’re free to experiment and you can taste the effects in a matter of days. So if it needs a bit more pepper, for example, you can change the results quickly. It’s made the job much more fun.”
Fergusson is working on a gin for Christmas called “chestnuts roasting on an open fire”. “It captures the consumer in a way that’s not just a cheesy gimmick. It’s authentic,” he said.
Visitors will be able to decide for themselves when the gin is available for tasting during special Christmas distillery tours.
Both in England and across Scotland, the whisky trail used to be the big lure, especially over the festive season. But this year 20,000 visitors have flocked to Eden Mill to see the gin being made, and there is a waiting list for the Christmas tour.
Online, Eden Mill is selling about 500 boxes a day of its “12 gins of Christmas” gift box. “I’d love to say that we cleverly thought all this through, but we didn’t,” said Miller. “We just happened to be in a good place to do it.”

'We don't want to look boring or basic': how teenagers dress now
Pyjamas aren’t just for sleeping this festive season. Fashion has decreed that you can also wear them to parties and to lunch. Equipment’s monochrome silk-satin pyjamas work well as versatile separates
There are two camps when it comes to quilted jackets: performance or fashion. Purists (anoraks, if you will) demand extreme weatherproofing guarantees while fashion lovers delighted in Raf Simons and Burberry’s supersized quilted coats. Whatever your budget, there’s a style to keep you toasty all winter long.
If Secret Santa, Black Friday and Elf on the Shelf already feel like three modern festive rituals too many, be warned – there is a new Christmas activity gaining traction in a street near you this year.
The 12 Pubs Of Christmas is said to have started in Ireland about 10 years ago, but now it appears to be taking over the UK. The idea is simple: wear the most garish Christmas jumper or festive outfit you can find, join a large group of people – perhaps 100 or so – then try to drink in 12 pubs on the same day.
And as if that liver-shocking prospect isn’t bad enough, there are generally rules of conduct for each pub – for example, everyone in the group must talk like James Bond, or all participants have to call each other Frank, or – perhaps better for fellow pubgoers – every member has to remain entirely silent for half an hour.
This weekend alone hundreds of people were signed up to head out on a 12 Pubs-style bar crawl, with events in Guildford, Crawley, Glasgow, Oxford, Cambridge, Reading, St Albans, London, Faversham, Bournemouth, Manchester, Bristol and Portsmouth. On Facebook, 40 events billed as 12 Pubs of Christmas have been advertised for this weekend or next, and many more happened last week too.
If it all feels too early, the people arranging the events probably agree. Aoife Conway was one of the organisers of a 50-person 12 Pubs event in Clapham, south-west London last night. “Everything seems so early,” she said. “I had my Christmas party on 8 December. But people have other places to go, especially in London, so they have a lot to squeeze in.”
Conway and her fellow organisers used whistles and a megaphone to marshal the revellers, some of whom were unfamiliar with the 12 Pubs requirements. In Camden, north-west London, a group of Canadians were trying out 12 Pubs, British style, led last night by Lindsay Laur, a teacher. “In Canada we used to sing ‘In the first bar of Christmas, the barman gave to me…’,” Laur said. “I don’t know if they do that in England.”
Conway said: “Karaoke is always a fun one. Someone starts singing Fairytale of New York and everyone has to join in. Or there’s the buddy system, where you have to hold your buddy’s hand and feed them their drink.”
The reaction from other pubgoers on previous events had been positive, she said. “They want to join in, and sometimes they come along too – it’s all in good spirits. It’s not rowdy.”
All the 12 Pubs organisers that the Observer spoke to said they checked beforehand to make sure pubs would be happy to have scores of people all turning up at once. Steve Dobbs has been arranging a 12 Pubs group in Colchester, Essex, for several years now, after taking part in an event in Australia with some Irish friends.
For Dobbs, a former bar worker who asks 12 Pubbers to donate to the Evelina Charity at Guys and St Thomas’s Children’s Hospital, it’s the “best night of the year”.
“I always make sure I tell people to respect the bar staff and respect the landlord,” he said.
“We’ve never had any problems before and I don’t plan to have any in the next couple of weeks. I’ve got friends who are door staff, and people who own the pubs who can help out.”
Not every group plans ahead though, and for every pub that welcomes groups, there are small ones that prefer to create a haven from the Christmas chaos. Alan Murphy is one, although he was labelled “Scrooge” for banning Christmas jumpers from the Lion and Key, his pub in Hull, East Yorkshire, last week.
“If you’re a group of 15 or 20 lads all dressed in Christmas jumpers, or Bananaman or whatever, do you want to be in a quiet pub with no loud music, candles on the table and couples drinking mulled wine and real ale?” he asked. “We just don’t have space.
“There’s miles better places for them to go. And we’ll take them in up to 8pm anyway.”
In Dublin there is now a semi-official list of pubs that don’t allow 12 Pubs groups. Ronan Lynch, whose family has owned the Swan in the city for decades, was the first to ban 12 Pubs groups. “We stopped it about eight years ago because it had just gone bananas, crazy,” he said. “When 20 or 30 people walk into a bar it’s very hard to assess what condition they’re in, and we have a duty not to serve people if they’ve had too much to drink. The games got out of hand – they might have a rule that you had to take something from the premises, so you had to keep an eye on them otherwise they’d walk out with chairs or pull your decorations down. Or you could have a group of 20 people who would all drop their glasses at the same time.”
He said the regular customers “who support us 52 weeks a year” were uncomfortable with “the Christmas jumpers with flashing lights, and fellas blowing whistles and horns”.
“It has paid off for us,” Lynch said. “People actually come to our pub because it’s a sanctuary.”
Despite its continuing hardline stance against marijuana, the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has shown some signs of relenting and this summer opened the door to allowing more farms to grow cannabis for official research purposes. That’s an important step forward that may change the potential marijuana has for medical treatment. Up to this point, researchers have had to depend on just one farm at the University of Mississippi to supply cannabis for all studies.
Eight states have voted to legalize recreational marijuana, and 28 states now allow its use for medical purposes. Under federal law, however, marijuana continues to be classified as a highly dangerous illegal drug. Despite the DEA’s resistance to reclassification, marijuana has a broad list of potential medical applications, from treating pain to neurological diseases. Further study could open up many new medical treatments.
“Researchers who conduct experimental studies and administer cannabis to their research participants have difficulty obtaining cannabis for their research,” says Madeline Meier, assistant professor of psychology at Arizona State University, who has studied the safety of long term marijuana use. But the end to a 50-year monopoly on medical research marijuana will change that, potentially opening up new areas of medical utility and easing the way to federal reclassification.
Marijuana has long been categorized as a Schedule I drug, which means that from the point of view of the government it has no medical benefit and a high potential for abuse. It is in the same category as heroin and LSD, and is in a more regulated schedule than drugs like methamphetamine and cocaine.
Despite that, researchers have slowly been making progress in studying it as a potential treatment for a host of diseases.
A small number of pharmaceutical companies are betting on cannabinoid treatments for a variety of diseases. GW Pharma in California markets a medication targeted at treating spasticity from multiple sclerosis, while UK-based Nemus Biosciences is developing a glaucoma treatment. Another pharmaceutical company, Kalytera, is looking at developing non-psychoactive cannabinoid medicines to treat osteoporosis and bone regeneration.
Using non-psychoactive synthetic derivatives of marijuana is one potential way to get around the Schedule I restrictions of the drug, explains Seth Yakatan, CEO of Kalytera. But to really “move the needle” on medical applications for marijuana, the drug would need to be reclassified by the DEA, says Yakatan.
While pharmaceutical companies explore new potential uses for marijuana derivatives, there are a number of medical uses with good research behind them for the plant itself, says Lester Grinspoon, associate professor emeritus of psychiatry at Harvard University. One of the most common medicinal uses is for cancer, though Grinspoon emphasizes that there is not enough research into cannabis’ use to treat the disease itself.
“Anyone who claims it cures cancer has very little basis to say that,” Grinspoon says. But it is a great adjunct therapy for patients already undergoing traditional cancer treatment, he says, as it helps with nausea and other symptoms related to chemotherapy.
Marijuana has also been found to be helpful in alleviating pain for MS patients, as well as helping with spasms for paraplegics and quadriplegics.
Similar to its uses for cancer patients, marijuana is helpful for treating the wasting associated with Aids, says Grinspoon. “Aids patients were the first to educate their doctors about cannabis, when the Aids epidemic spread like wild.” Grinspoon points out that patients discovered on their own that smoking marijuana would help them keep food down, and doctors consequently learned about that use from their patients.
Chronic pain is another area where marijuana has been useful, says Grinspoon. While research in the area has been somewhat mixed, with a number of studies finding it helps while others saying marijuana is not an effective pain medication, opioid pain medication use has declined in states with liberal marijuana laws. That correlation made headlines in light of the alarming epidemic of opioid abuse in the US.
While some people are troubled by the psychoactive effects of the drug, there are strains that have minimal psychoactive effects, says Grinspoon, making them ideal for medical use.
Researchers continue to try to tease out other potential benefits of cannabis and provide further evidence for its use, with the number of studies increasing every year. But for a promising treatment with so many applications, there is still a lot of stigma associated with the drug.
Studies like Meier’s, showing the safety of long term recreational cannabis use, chip away at that stigma. Her longitudinal study, published in June in JAMA Psychiatry, followed people who already used marijuana recreationally, collecting extensive health information on participants when they were 26 and 38 years old. The study found that participants had no long term physical health risks from the drug except for a higher likelihood of periodontal disease.
Grinspoon says it’s past time that the DEA change the classification of cannabis. Unlike an opioid, “no one has ever died of an overdose of marijuana,” Grinspoon says. “Aspirin causes about 1,000 deaths a year, so why don’t we schedule aspirin?”
Fashion advertising is an industry which is often accused of a lack of diversity, and as a response, black model Deddeh Howard has recreated campaigns casting herself in ads originally featuring white models by brands like Guess, Chanel and Calvin Klein. The series, entitled Black Mirror, aims to raise awareness of the issue and highlight how ‘black girls are almost invisible’ in this area
A Christmas Carol takes the form of a dark journey of the soul from wilfulness, selfishness, and miserliness towards redemption, generosity and happiness. The figure of Scrooge is initially presented as a man locked into unhappy solitude and petty cruelty, someone whose ungiving, unyielding and resolute nature causes him no joy, but rather a grim satisfaction at having power over others, a power which he will wield in the darkest days of winter with particular determination, a power which goes against the very idea of what became known as the Christmas spirit.
This idea of Christmas, which the story itself did much to popularise, was already being preached about and written about in newspaper editorials when A Christmas Carol appeared in 1843. Christmas, in its new manifestation, would include the idea of giving as well as receiving, of looking after the less fortunate as well as eating well and spending time in good company.
For this reinvention of a tradition to become even more popular, an image was needed of a man who deliberately excluded himself from the cheer and the cosiness that the tradition, in all its fragility, implied. In the story, this man would be taken through a personal purgatory in order to emerge purified. He would see many things that would horrify him or make him feel guilty and unloved, all the more to make the communal cheer of Christmas seem relished by those who had begun to enjoy it. The story takes pleasure in the nightmares Scrooge must witness; these horrifying visions, the details of their descriptions, have richer textures than the subsequent images of Scrooge as a man who has learned his lesson and who has resolved to change his life.
Part of the power of the book comes from the grim, unearthly picture it draws of London. Since London was a collection of villages in which anyone moving from a posh square to an important public building could catch a glimpse down the many side streets that housed the poor, in which privileged and pauper passed each other daily, then the novel itself gained nourishment from the friction between classes, from the closeness of the little streets to the great. In the later 19th century, a number of writers saw the startling possibilities such contrasts offered, where the London of Dickens, so sprawling, vast, and filled with drama, could be rendered as a ghostly place where substance became shadow.
In books such as Robert Louis Stevenson’s Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886) or Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891), London could become a place of secrets, a city in which many people, otherwise normal and sane, could change their form as they moved from street to street, or from drawing room to attic.
Henry James would set his novel of 19th-century terrorism in this London. The Princess Casamassima (1886) “proceeded quite directly,” he wrote, “during the first year of a long residence in London, from the habit of walking the streets. I walked a great deal – for exercise, for amusement, for acquisition, and above all I always walked home at evening’s end, when the evening had been spent elsewhere, as happened more often than not.”
Dickens, too, told a friend that he had composed A Christmas Carol in his head as he walked about “the black streets of London, fifteen and twenty miles, many a night when all the sober folks had gone to bed”. The images that came to him then were of spirits and phantoms, aspects of a dream city in which nothing remained stable – least of all the past, the present or the future, which live like unearthly protagonists in the story Dickens created. The London he made in A Christmas Carol is as much haunted by its citizens as inhabited by them.
Dickens takes Scrooge on a journey in which time and space have no solidity, through a London of the imagination, using fictional registers that would have immense influence on ways in which Christmas is celebrated to this day.
When Scrooge looks out of the window he sees the air “filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they went”. The Ghost who propels Scrooge is merciless and relentless, forcing him, at first, to live in a time when past and present merge. Some of the images he sees are of comfort and joy, but they are experiences in which he cannot share. They are disrupted by what he can hear, as the happy people are discussing him. One man, for example, who is enjoying domestic bliss, says: “I passed his office window ... and there he sat alone. Quite alone in the world, I do believe.”
Later, Scrooge will see the abode of the Cratchit family. “They were not a handsome family ... but they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another, and contented with the time.” The family, once they have said grace, consume a goose on Christmas Day. “There never was such a goose ... Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal admiration.” Indeed, the Cratchit family themselves, including the doomed Tiny Tim, become the subject of universal admiration. But they too, despite their sweetness, discuss Scrooge, who has to listen as Mrs Cratchit wishes to drink “the health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr Scrooge”.
Later, in Scrooge’s dark night of the soul, he will have also to witness his nephew and the nephew’s friends playing a parlour game in which they are asked to guess the identity of “an animal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes, and lived in London, and walked about the streets.” His name, of course, is Scrooge.
Such visions will seem almost innocent compared to the darker ones that are to come as Scrooge will be forced to witness his servants selling his clothes and his curtains as he lies on his deathbed. They will refer to him as “a wicked old screw”. Soon, he will be shown the relief and happiness of those in debt to him on hearing of his demise: “The only emotion, that the Ghost could show him, caused by the event, was one of pleasure.”
When his redemption comes, as it must, because what happens to Scrooge in the night has a moral purpose, then the diction of the story itself will lighten, as Scrooge’s meanness lightens. The sentence structure and a generosity in rhythm of the prose will reflect the lifting of his burden:
The word dream has been transformed, has been taken from its dark, cold, lonely, fearful place and, instead of being a watchword for frightful imaginings, filled with mockery and unbearable visions, has come to mean an opening of the self, a way of reimagining the world. And so, with that change, from nightmare to sweet reality, from miserliness to giving, from misery to merriness, Christmas came into being. Courtesy of Dickens, we live in its shadow still and on one cheery, idealised day of the year, as we force Scrooge to appear as merely a distant warning to us all, we become the happy, jolly Cratchits.
I rescued a ponytail palm that had several growing points at the top of the trunk, but only one had leaves. This is flourishing, but the others remain leafless and dead-looking. The plant seems healthy overall, but it looks lopsided. What can I do?
One side is flourishing, which is a great sign. The simplest trick would be to cut off the top just below the good growth. Seal with wax if you can and wait several weeks, making sure that the plant doesn’t dry out completely around the base, but keeping watering to the bare minimum. I’ll bet good money that new growth will then appear evenly around the top of the plant.
Ponytail palms (Beaucarnea recurvata) are multiheaded because someone pruned them in the nursery to promote bushy growth. You’ll do the same when you hack the head off (you may need to use a saw to do this cleanly).
You can take a gamble that the healthy part of the top you cut off will re-root if you pot it up. This can be a slow process and the leaves may die back, but it often works. A little rooting hormone wouldn’t go amiss. Don’t let it dry out, but don’t overwater or it will rot. Good luck.
Seed dormancy sounds rather appealing right now. I’d like to wrap myself up in a warm coat and spend the next few months in stasis until spring arrives. If only that was what really happens. It may seem as if seeds are just lying in the soil waiting for the temperature to rise, but something else is going on.
For many seeds, dormancy is broken not by a rise in temperature but by a drop. It’s the cold of winter these seeds are after. The season’s cycle of frost, harsh winds and bitter rains slowly softens the tough seed coat, rolling it around in the soil, freezing and then thawing again, until the seed can take up water and germinate. This is known as stratification, or cold treatment. You can tell seeds that need a cold period before germinating because they have hard bony coats that are impervious to water.
Having such a tough shell ensures that germination occurs only when conditions are right. Weather fluctuates; you don’t want your seed jumping into germination just because autumn has a few cold nights and then a warm one. It’s not spring yet and those cold nights did not represent winter. So time and temperature are the keys necessary to unlock germination for many seeds. For others it may be light, smoke, certain chemicals or spending time in an animal’s gut.
Many domesticated plants have undergone numerous selection pressures, so dormancy isn’t such a big deal. Wild plants, however, are fiercely dedicated to their dormancy methods. Common plants that require stratification include apples, sloes, hawthorns, plums and acorns, but also smaller seed from herbaceous perennials such as aquilegia, lavender, sage, sedums, perennial sweet peas, wild rose and hops.
One way to break this dormancy is to leave it up to nature. This is not the fast route, but it’s a sure one. Sow seeds outside now in pots, cover with grit (mostly so that it’s easy to weed out any interlopers) and leave them to the elements. Be patient: signs of life should appear, if not this spring, then the following. You can also make a seed bed for stratification. Use a gritty compost mix, one part grit to three parts compost. Excess moisture can be a problem, so make sure it is free-draining.
Or cheat. You can use the fridge (and sometimes the freezer), placing the seed either on a damp sheet of kitchen towel or in damp vermiculite in a freezer bag (on which you can write all the details: seed source, date, temperature requirements etc). Most seed that requires a winter chill will need between two weeks and three months before dormancy is broken. Keep checking the seeds until you see signs of life. Once they germinate, take them out of the fridge, pot them up and keep them frost-free until you can put them outside.
Born in London, Kojo Kankam, aka MC Novelist, began recording aged seven after his uncle introduced him to grime. In 2012 he was voted deputy young mayor of Lewisham. At 17, he was nominated for best grime act at the 2014 Mobo awards. Now 19, he has started his own label, Mmmyeh Records; his new single, No Path, is out in January. He lives with his mother and three siblings in Brockley.
What do you want to achieve in life?
I am not really interested in money. I feel like I could be as rich as I want to be, but the problem is people understanding what it’s like to be rich inside. I’d like to get that message across to people.
What is the worst thing anyone’s said to you?
I was at a party and I had on fresh Air Force 1s, and some dude just started dissing my trainers. I was so confused.
What is top of your bucket list?
To buy my mum a house.
What is your guiltiest pleasure? 
I tend not to do things that I feel I shouldn’t be doing.
What do you admire most about your parents? And what do you find most annoying?
I grew up with my mum, but I am in contact with my dad. What I admire about them is that they both have an understanding of peace. Some people come from families where parents are together, but there’s no peace. The most annoying thing about my mum is that I might have to explain something 10 times to her. My dad lives in Ghana. Other than that, it’s all good.
Which living person do you most admire, and why?
My little brother, Dante. He is 14 – he doesn’t have a point to prove.
What is the best thing about being a teen? And the worst?
The best thing is being able to add teen next to a number, 19. The worst is not being perceived how you actually are, based on your age.
When are you happiest?
When I am praying and meditating on good things.
What is the trait you most dislike in yourself?
When I am not open-hearted to everything.
What is the trait you most dislike in others?
Lying.
What’s your favourite film?
Back To The Future.
What makes you unhappy? 
When I am not prepared for the weather.
What do you like most about your appearance? And dislike?
I like that I don’t look like anyone. I don’t have any dislikes. You’ve got to love yourself to the maximum.
What is your most unappealing habit?
When people talk to me and I am silent because I am thinking.
What is your favourite food?
Nachos with cheese.
What or who is the greatest love of your life?
My girlfriend.

Not very often. I can’t wait to get married. So I have laid off all of that stuff.
Which tune is the soundtrack to your life?
An instrumental of mine called Nostalgia.
Tell us a joke.
I am a man of natural banter. I don’t crack jokes.
An actor’s life is hard: it’s just one audition after another, and you have to grow a wall-thick skin to deal with all the rejection. For Bird, however, things went a little differently: she was signed to the Alphabet Kidz agency just before her sixth birthday and two weeks later beat hundreds of other young actors to land the lead role in a £1.4bn show.
She is the voice of Peppa Pig, the eponymous piglet who enjoys dressing up and jumping in muddy puddles. Bird, who in real life has two pet pigs (called, of course, Peppa and George), has now voiced Peppa Pig for eight years. Early on, she was too young to read the scripts, but that didn’t stop her winning a Bafta at nine.
The show, while simple in its format of five-minute episodes, has taken the world by storm and is now shown in 180 territories and broadcast in 40 different languages. Not bad for a first role. Were there any clues that this one audition would lead to a starring role in a global franchise? Bird has said she doesn’t understand it herself. “I just auditioned and they said my voice matched. because it is quite husky.”
Some teens might be grossed out by a bowl of bananas starting to rot and attract flies; high school student Garimella came up with a potentially life-saving idea. The “flybot” – a tiny, flying robot that avoids obstacles by mimicking the way a fruit fly avoids threats and moving obstacles – could be used in search-and-rescue missions in dangerous environments, and went on to win the Google Computer Science award in 2014. Garimella has since turned his hand to everything from robotic violin tuners to algorithms that could help doctors diagnose brain tumours.
When Banerjee turned his Lego bricks into a braille printer for the blind for a school science project, it wasn’t just the famous toy company that was singing the then 12-year-old’s praises. The product, which made computing more affordable for millions of visually impaired people, also caught the attention of Intel, and the award-winning Braigo Labs (an amalgamation of Lego and braille) was born. “He’s solving a real problem, and he wants to go off and disrupt an existing industry,” Edward Ross, director of inventor platforms at Intel, has said. “That’s really what it’s all about.”
What started as a hobby, buying rare trainers and selling them on to classmates, is now a lucrative enterprise. A sneaker broker to the stars (Chris Brown and Drake are fans), Kapelushnik has accumulated 5,000 pairs and is well on his way to making his first million.
While chatting with her friends on social media, this Saudi teen living in Germany realised there was no emoji to represent her, so she designed one. Now she’s campaigning to get it added to phones (it’s currently being considered by the Unicode Consortium). “In this day and age, representation is extremely important,” Alhumedhi said. “People want to be acknowledged. There are so many Muslim women in this world who wear the headscarf. It might seem trivial, but it’s different when you see yourself on the keyboard around the world.”
After making her acting debut at the age of seven alongside her father in I Am Legend, the daughter of Hollywood golden couple Will and Jada Pinkett Smith has forged her own way, becoming the youngest artist signed to Jay Z’s record label, Roc Nation, at 10 – remember Whip My Hair? Since then, she’s swapped the smiley, happy, preteen style for a cooler, pared-back, Instagram-friendly aesthetic. She has starred in a Marc Jacobs ad, and this year Karl Lagerfeld made her his muse, photographing her for Chanel AW16. She and her older brother, Jaden (star of Netflix’s The Get Down, directed by Baz Luhrmann), have been dubbed the “coolest teens on the planet”.
Barack and Michelle Obama’s youngest has lived her teen years in the White House (she was seven at her father’s inauguration), but stays down to earth: she spent the summer working on the till in a seafood shack (even if secret service agents sat at the tables outside). Her awkward moments have been captured the world over (most recently when Malia, 18, was snapped giving Sasha a sarcastic thumbs up as her little sister spoke to actor Ryan Reynolds at a Canadian state dinner).
More importantly, Sasha has had a unique global education, meeting Malala Yousafzai at the White House, and helping her mother promote women’s education in Liberia and Morocco. In this year’s Thanksgiving message, the outgoing president described his daughters as “funny, smart, humble and extraordinary young women”. All eyes on the next-gen Obamas.
The pint-sized dancer was thrust into the limelight aged just eight, when she starred on US reality show Dance Moms. But she reached a global audience thanks to Australian singer Sia, who cast her in the video for Elastic Heart. Four videos, several world tours and stage appearances later, Ziegler has become more recognisable wearing her cropped blond Sia wig than sporting her natural hair. She has modelled for Ralph Lauren and become a judge on the junior version of So You Think You Can Dance.
Photographing the Burberry campaign, skateboarding through his mother Victoria’s Dover Street store and hooking up with Hollywood ingenue Chloë Grace Moretz; the eldest Beckham kid couldn’t attract more attention if he had followed his father, David, on to the football pitch. Last week, Beckham announced to his 8.8m Instagram followers that next year he will be bringing out What I See, a photography book published by Penguin Random House. If even a small proportion of his social media followers buys the book, he has a bestseller on his hands.
This year, as South Africa suffered its worst drought since 1982, a Johannesburg schoolgirl came up with a potential solution. Nirghin found an orange peel mixture had better water-retaining properties than existing “super-absorbent polymers”, which are usually expensive and non-biodegradable. Her invention, which aims to help farmers save both money and crops, is made up of waste products from the juice manufacturing process, including discarded orange and avocado peel; it won Nirghin a $50,000 scholarship at the annual Google Science Fair.
The half-Iranian star of acclaimed comedy Black-ish (a sitcom about an upper-middle-class African American family) is passionate about media diversity: “We are in the middle of a ‘representation renaissance’,” she has said. She is “constantly… in conversation about keeping roles for women and people of colour multifaceted and representative of our true nature”.
Sick of being cooked “kid food” by his parents, McGarry took matters into his own hands with a little bit of help from The French Laundry Cookbook. By 11, he was hosting a supper club in his mum’s kitchen, cooking “progressive American cuisine”; at 15, he was charging $160 a head for his eight-course tasting menu. He has now taken up residency in New York espresso bar Kava, under the name Eureka, where his 16-course feasts are becoming the stuff of legend.
Grimm didn’t plan to become the poster boy for a national fight for equal rights for transgender students, but when his school wouldn’t allow him to use the boys’ toilets, a long legal battle ensued. The result, now in the hands of the supreme court, could have implications for young trans people all over the US. “That I have the opportunity to ensure that, hopefully, fewer kids – or anybody – will have to go through this in the future makes me feel good,” Grimm said.
These Stratford Girls’ grammar school pupils were shocked to discover that young LGBT people are at much higher risk of depression and suicide; two years ago they teamed up to create the I’m Okay app, giving support and information to young people exploring their sexuality and gender. Thousands of people have since downloaded the app from the Google Play store; it won a national Apps for Good award in 2014.
The US’s second youngest player to become a chess grandmaster, Xiong stormed on to the scene aged 14 and snatched first place at the 24th Chicago Open. He played his first game at five, when he decided to join a friend who was playing by himself. Xiong carried on until he was the world’s under-20 champion, at just 15.
In 2015, Nithiyanandam won the Google Science Fair prize for developing a test to diagnose Alzheimer’s 10 years before any symptoms appear. An antibody is injected that then attaches to proteins present in the earliest stages of the disease; the injection contains fluorescent particles that can be picked up on a brain scan.
“This early diagnosis could help families prepare for the future and ensure that existing drugs are used to better effect,” Nithiyanandam explained. The Surrey schoolboy is now tackling the treatment of triple negative breast cancer, a rare form found in 15-20% of women with breast cancer. It doesn’t respond to drugs, and must be treated with a risky combination of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. “Most cancers have receptors on their surface that bind to drugs like tamoxifen, but triple negative doesn’t,” Nithiyanandam explained. Working at home and in his school lab, he has found a way to block a protein that prevents those receptors from forming, thus turning this type of breast cancer into one that responds to drugs. “Science isn’t about your age, it’s about ideas,” he told Wired magazine.
Formerly a Little League baseball pitcher, Davis was the first African American girl to play in the Little League World Series, and the first female to pitch a winning game. The baseball (and basketball) prodigy was spotted at the age of seven while playing with her older brothers. Since releasing her memoir last year, Mo’ne Davis: Remember My Name, she has designed trainers to raise money for Plan International’s Because I Am A Girl campaign, aimed at helping lift girls in the developing world out of poverty.
Dubbed “the next Mark Zuckerberg”, Pasternak created the chart-topping app Impossible Rush (a colour-matching game) that was downloaded more than 1.3m times and made him a tech star at just 15. That success allowed him to secure just under $2m in funding from major Silicon Valley investors, move to Manhattan and launch his own startup, Flogg. He had noticed that friends were increasingly selling unwanted items to people they knew through Facebook, rather than to strangers on Gumtree or eBay. Yet Facebook “wasn’t really doing anything to look after their user experience”. So he created an app that allows users to buy and sell items through their Facebook connections with a swipe left or right; the Sydney Morning Herald described Flogg as “the love child of Tinder and eBay”.
Ball was 14 when he became interested in beauty, but could only find makeup tutorial videos aimed at girls; finding what he wanted in Boots was an ordeal. “I was so embarrassed, I didn’t even look at shades and just picked the first products I had seen YouTubers talk about,” he said. So Ball decided to start his own YouTube channel, Looking For Lewys, with tutorials aimed primarily at men. By the time he was 16, he had had over 1.2m views; he now has more than 115,000 subscribers. As well as makeup and fashion tips, Ball shares his favourite music, DIY projects and even anecdotes, in between revising for his A-levels.
Male beauty is having a major moment, and brands are waking up to it. Ball recently signed to Gleam Futures, the talent agency with clients such as YouTube megastars Jim Chapman and Zoella; in the US, male beauty blogger James Charles was named CoverGirl’s first CoverBoy in October. “I think brands have realised that makeup isn’t just for girls,” Ball has said. “It’s for everyone.”
Dembele has had coaches fighting over him for most of his life. (It has been reported that the football prodigy could do 100 keepie-uppies at the age of five.) London-born, he is eligible to play for Scotland, England and Ivory Coast. In October, aged just 13, he made his debut for Celtic’s under-20 side; he has played for Scotland’s youth team this year, but has since been snatched up by the England under-16s.
Coggan always wanted to write a novel, and at 13 sat down to have a go on her dad’s laptop. That turned into The Catalyst, a thrilling, magical novel that was published to acclaim when she was just 15. A follow-up, The Reaction, was published this year; she is now working on a third novel while promoting her first around the world.
Shiraishi started rock climbing in Central Park, aged six. She is now one of the strongest, youngest climbers of all time. Earlier this year, on a spring break to Japan a week before her 15th birthday, she was the first woman and youngest person ever to climb a V15 “boulder problem” (the V scale system begins at V0, a ladder, and goes up to V16).
Actor Stenberg, whose first name means “power” in Zulu, is outspoken on racial and gender politics. She has an African American mother, a Danish father, and identifies as non-binary, saying “the concept of gender is not really real”. In 2015, she was named “one of the most incendiary voices of her generation” by Dazed magazine, and feminist of the year by the Ms Foundation for Women.
Though Stenberg had been performing music since childhood, and appeared in feature films since 2010 (including a memorable performance as Rue in The Hunger Games), more recently she has been making waves on social media. She was just 16 when she posted a school project video, Don’t Cash Crop My Cornrows, that promptly went viral. In it, she asked, “What would America be like if we loved black people as much as we love black culture?” Beyoncé invited her to appear on her visual album Lemonade, which was filmed in secret last year. “I just got this phone call,” Stenberg recalled. “It was like, ‘Go to New Orleans; Beyoncé wants you there.’” When Beyoncé met Stenberg, she said, “I just wanted to tell you, I want Blue Ivy [her daughter] to be just like you.” High praise indeed.
Dubbed the new Beth Tweddle, this schoolgirl from Stockport landed a spot on the England gymnastics squad this year. Green’s mother works as a lollipop and dinner lady, while her daughter trains for 20 hours a week over six days. She is supported by several trusts and charities, allowing her to prepare for the English and junior British championships next spring.
To help the UK’s 200,000 young carers, these five pupils from Denbigh High in Luton created weKonnekt, an app featuring an online forum, stories from other carers, as well as practical functions such as double-tap access to emergency services and a directory of local services. They have won several awards, and this year presented the app at Wembley Arena to an audience of 12,000 young entrepreneurs. They’re now hoping to launch an iOS version of the app.
Today’s youngest generation with a label, born after 2000, are connected yet isolated, savvy but anxious, indulged yet stressed. They have grown up with social media, a constant proliferation of information on a fully mobile internet, the rise of Islamic State and other forms of terrorism. As these teenagers approach adulthood, against the political backdrop of Brexit and President Trump, how will they shape the future?
The single biggest difference between Generation Z and other generations is how connected they are, and have been since birth. On average, young people in the UK, aged between five and 16, spend three hours online every day. Connectivity permeates their lives – from friendships to relationships, news, entertainment, shopping – and has transformed how they interact. The most popular apps are Snapchat, Instagram and messaging app Kik; the average teenager has at least 150 followers on Instagram, and spends around half an hour a day on Snapchat.
Young people are also reported to have a much more fluid sense of sexual identity and gender. A National Citizen Service (NCS) poll of 1,000 teenagers published in October this year found that only 63% of teens aged 16 and 17 define themselves as 100% straight (compared with 78% of adults). Gender identity is also less binary, with 78% of young men identifying as 100% male, and 80% of young women identifying as 100% female, according to the same NCS poll.
How happy is Generation Z? A World Health Organisation survey carried out in 42 countries in 2013/4, and reported this year, found that young men and women in the UK are among the least satisfied with their lives, particularly 15-year-olds in England and Wales. The survey (which measures life satisfaction in relation to everything from relationships with family to school, mental health and drug use) showed that the highest rate of anxiety and health worries occurred among teenage girls in England, Wales and Scotland.
One of the starkest markers of Gen Z to date is the sharp rise in reported mental health issues. Young men and women in the UK are seeking treatment for low self-esteem, anxiety, depression and self-harm, in greater proportions than any other generation on record. (Some of this may be because these conditions were not widely diagnosed or understood in the past.)
According to the NSPCC, the biggest concern of young people calling its ChildLine in 2015/16 was mental health issues, accounting for 31% of telephone counselling sessions. In 1986, ChildLine’s first year of taking calls, the most common reasons for contacting the NSPCC were sexual and physical abuse, and family issues. Mental health concerns didn’t rank anywhere in the top 10. So what has changed?
“What we’re seeing is a generation of children who are expressing much more clearly that they are just generally so unhappy with themselves and the situations around them,” says Emily Cherry, head of participation at the NSPCC. “When it comes to low self-esteem, a lot of young people are putting that down to [concerns about] education, their future and the online world. Particularly the online world, and how it’s following young people around – it’s with them 24/7. Every time they switch on their phones they’re getting messages about parties they haven’t been invited to, or they’re seeing photos of their friends doing things, or their whole self-worth is based on how many likes they’re getting on Facebook. It absolutely permeates their sense of self-worth.”
The mass availability of news has had an impact, Cherry adds, and there is a spike in the number of calls to ChildLine during major world events. “Not just terrorism – we also saw this with the US elections and Brexit. Online, they are seeing quite adult-focused news and phoning ChildLine really fearful for themselves and their future.”
However, Cherry also points out that many of the children contacting ChildLine are doing so because there are fewer mental health services available to them. “Child and adolescent services in particular are massively stretched in the current climate. There is no support available, and that’s a difference to what we were hearing in 1986.”
One of the most striking developments is the increase in depression and anxiety among young women in England, with more than a third reporting symptoms of distress, according to a survey of 13,000 14-year-olds by the Department for Education in 2014. Thirty-seven per cent of girls reported feeling unhappy, worthless or unable to concentrate, an increase of 4% since 2010, and more than double the proportion of boys reporting the same feelings.
Betsy de Thierry is a child and adolescent psychotherapist, and a founding director of the Trauma Recovery Centre, an organisation that supports traumatised young people across the UK. She says the levels of stress among the children and teachers she works with is unprecedented. “The pressure on young people these days is absolutely extraordinary – it has never been the same before. They’re living with lots of stress – their parents desperately wanting them to do well because of financial pressures, teachers wanting them to do well because they’ll be assessed,” De Thierry says.
She points to a shift of focus in schools, towards “hard” subjects and away from arts and sport, as one cause of increased pressure on young people. “I would argue that the biggest damage has been done in the reduction of creative arts, sports, music and free time. We know from neuroscience that young people are dependent on having time to play – that’s how their brains develop, how they make sense of the world and how they become healthy young people. Without that, their behaviour changes and they act out or act in – and when they act in, they can self-harm and get depressed.”
But the big positive is that teenagers are wise to the challenges facing their generation, and taking action. In 2014 the UK Youth Parliament, a youth organisation of elected members, voted to campaign on raising awareness around mental health issues among young people; in 2015, they called for greater health service provision and compulsory mental health education in schools, to help challenge damaging stereotypes.
This year, the youth parliament’s focus is on education, under the banner “Curriculum for Life”. They are calling for schools to put more on the syllabus about finance, sex and relationships, and politics. At the same time, the parliament has focused on tackling racism, religious discrimination and the dangers of hate speech.
Generation Z’s wider political engagement is going through a period of transformation. Young British voters have become more active in politics, with an estimated 58% of 18- to 24-year-olds voting in the 2015 general election, according to the British Election Study; this represents a significant jump, from 38% turnout among the same age group in 2005. For the EU referendum in June, an estimated 64% of young voters went to the polls, according to a survey conducted by Opinium and the London School of Economics – far higher than the initial gloomy estimates.
But while casting a vote at the polling station is one way of making your voice heard, young voters are finding other outlets for their political views. While their parents grew up in a world focused on two or three political parties and national debates, the approach of younger voters is quite different. Research by the European Commission in 2013 found that “young people regard voting as one option among many, and they show their political engagement in many different, issue-specific ways that can potentially influence policies more directly”.
While most of Generation Z are still too young to vote, their focus has shifted away from party politics to single-topic issues such as feminism or climate change; much of the civic engagement and organising they do takes place on social media rather than through traditional political structures.
Today’s teenagers might be our most abstemious yet. Smoking and alcohol use is at its lowest levels among young people in England since 1982, when records began, according to a 2014 NHS survey. Less than one in five 11- to 15-year-olds said they had smoked, while 38% of adolescents in the same age group had tried alcohol at least once – also the lowest proportion since records began. Drug use among under-16s was also down: 15% of 11- to 15-year-olds reported having taken drugs of any kind, a dramatic decrease from 29% in 2001.
The feelings of social isolation reported by many teenagers can be hard for older people to understand. “There’s a perception that this generation should be the happiest and the most content, because they’ve got so much connectivity, across the world, and so much information at their fingertips,” Cherry says. “But that connectivity is actually disconnecting people from real friendships and the opportunity to enjoy the world together. It’s creating absolutely unrealistic ideals that young people can’t get to.”
De Thierry believes the solution is more real-life contact and interaction. “We know that social isolation can have lifelong consequences on the brain and relationships and teenagers’ ability to make sense of the world. Depression and anxiety are already on the rise and being normalised. When children have childhoods, and young people are allowed to be creative and spend time with each other, then they shouldn’t be depressed or anxious.”
Without intervention, De Thierry anticipates an increase in adult mental health issues, unemployment and burnout. “People think they’ve got 1,000 friends but in actual fact, who really knows them? It’s probably nobody these days – not their parents, as they don’t eat together and are working longer hours. And not their siblings, possibly because they’re sitting in separate rooms on phones and they text each other. Being known is a really important part of being alive.”
The contradictions of connectivity are the real challenge for Generation Z and for society at large. In many ways, they already appear more responsible than their predecessors – more politically engaged and eager to reframe our perspectives on sexual orientation and gender, while demanding action on the issues of mental health, education, equality and racism. As they emerge into adulthood, we will see what world they make.
'We don't want to look boring or basic': how teenagers dress now
My kitchen is … a temporary one. I’m living in Okinawa in my girlfriend’s apartment, and most of my things are in storage. I don’t need much to be able to cook, though. It’s a small space and everything in it is important. The two changes I made when I moved in were to remove the microwave – which she never used – and replace the rice cooker with a traditional cast-iron cooking pot. From my experience cast iron makes the best plain white rice – it’s the kind of pot you’ll find in the very best sushi restaurants. Also, the iron is like a natural additive. I don’t like electricity much.
My favourite kitchen tools are … traditional ones: an oroshigane (a fine grater), an uragoshiki (a sieve made of bamboo with horse-hair meshing) and a fine metal sieve – I normally use about 10 when I’m cooking. Also, cooking chopsticks, and a suribachi and surikogi (a Japanese mortar and pestle). The suribachi I use is 30cm wide – anything smaller feels like a child’s toy. I get them directly from an artisan really cheap, and I usually take at least a few tools with me when I go abroad to cook. The surikogi is made from sansho (Japanese pepper) wood, which seasons whatever you grind with it. Sansho wood has all sorts of beneficial properties – people in the olden days really knew what they were doing when they came up with this kind of tool.
My storecupboard staples are … rice, white sesame seeds, konbu (seaweed), kuzu starch (a thickener made from kuzu root, a mountain plant) and kanten (agar). I always have a tin of sweet kanten jelly in the fridge for my girlfriend – not too much sugar, lots of fruit (there’s so much wonderful fruit in Okinawa).
When I’m starving I … have onigiri rice balls, most often with miso. For me, miso has medicinal purposes – if I have digestive problems, I’ll have a spoonful of miso; it is so cleansing. My favourite is barley miso, from Kumamoto.
My culinary inspiration is … vegetables. Whenever I go to cook somewhere, I first go to the market. I don’t have a menu in mind – I first need to meet the produce. Say hello, see what looks happy, or what speaks to me.
My best-kept kitchen secret is … to make sure the kitchen is completely clean and tidy by the time I’m ready to eat. Tidying up as you go and having nothing more to do makes the experience of eating so much better.
When I’m invited to dinner I always take … sesame tofu. It takes quite a long time to make and people really appreciate the effort – it’s not something most people are able to do, and it isn’t something you can buy either. In Okinawa, people use peanuts instead of sesame, so I’ve been making a lot of that. It makes everyone so happy.
Everything tastes better with … ponzu (citrus-flavoured soy sauce). A friend of mine in the Wakayama region produces his own – it’s a small-scale artisanal production, with daidai and yuzu and kankitsu citrus juices … I was amazed to find bottles of his ponzu on the tables at Alain Ducasse in Paris a couple years ago.
I’m celebrating my 16th with a “lual” – a beach party – with family and friends. We’ll play electronic, funk and sertaneja, dance, have some drinks and watch the sun go down. It will be cool.
It’s been a good year for me personally: I can do things I wasn’t allowed to do before. My mother never let me go to the beach with my friends, but now I am 16, I have more freedom. But I have to earn her confidence with the way I behave. Many girls get pregnant young, or use drugs and cause trouble. My mother is worried I will get involved, but I want to go to college and study economics, move to Rio, São Paulo or one of the other cities, where there are more opportunities. I’d like to have a good life, with a good salary and a good husband, and to build a family. But it’s difficult.
I dropped out of school last year because I couldn’t keep up. I’m intelligent, but a lot has happened in my life. I lost my father when I was nine and I had to change school. It was a pain inside me that I never knew existed and it affected my studies. I must now make up for lost time.
Brazil is beautiful, but there are also many bad things, like corruption and violence, particularly against women. Another worry is I don’t know what the future of our planet will be after Obama. I’m terrified there might be a world war, because so many people are unhappy with the way things are.
My generation is a really cool generation. We have the internet for communication and research, and cellphones. I got one for my birthday last year. It’s my addiction; I depend on it. I wake up with it and am on it all day. But I think my grandparents had more fun. We sit around all day on the internet; they played with kites. I have never done that.
Turning 16 means you can officially buy alcohol and get into clubs, but since most Danes have been doing this for years anyway, it’s not a huge deal. I can also get rid of my child’s bus pass and library card. But other than that? It’s life as normal.
We have a big celebration when we get confirmed in Denmark, aged 13 or 14. I wore a white dress and had an enormous cake, and there was a gift list. This is about tradition more than religion, and it’s the biggest party most people ever have, including weddings. But the “sweet 16” hasn’t quite reached Scandinavia.
My parents are divorced, which is pretty normal here, so I had one party at my dad’s and another at my mum’s. There are a few birthday customs we stuck to, such as flying the Danish flag and eating kagemand – this is a cake in the shape of a girl or a boy, depending on your gender, and everyone screams as you cut its head off. It’s also tradition to do 16 shots to celebrate turning 16. I felt terrible after this, but Mum had a bag ready in case I needed to throw up. Then we ate pizza and went for a walk with a few beers.
My friends and I have a lot of freedom to go out whenever we want, so there’s not much to rebel against. My parents’ only rules are that I never walk home alone and text them where I’m going. I don’t have a curfew, but they like me to be back by 3am (this is early: some friends don’t have to be home until 5am).
It’s good being a teenager here. Because we have the welfare state, we’re all looked after. I see refugees coming to my town from Syria and realise how lucky I am. It’s not just that I have a roof over my head and clean water and clothes to wear; I also have pizza and beer and new clothes. And I got an iPhone for my birthday. I’d say I’m a pretty happy Dane right now.
I still worry about the future, like studying something for ages, then realising I don’t want to pursue that as my career, or not getting a good job. But Danes often study until their late 20s and have kids or marry much later, so I don’t have to think about any of that yet. I just get to be a teenager.
I’ve never celebrated my birthday before. I’m from Kitale, a village in Kenya, and birthdays aren’t a big thing; lots of people don’t even know their exact age. At the moment, though, I’m in Uganda with my sister, her friend, and seven orphans, and we’re going to have a dinner at home. We’ll have cake and dance.
Life here is very different from life in the village. When I was little, I looked for firewood, did chores or looked after the cows. From when I was 10 until I was 14, I dug in our family’s farm. We children did the digging, and our parents did the planting. If my sisters were there, it was more fun, but mostly it was terrible. I’d be tired, and my parents would force me to dig. We planted beans and maize, and that’s what we ate. Sometimes we had a bit extra to sell, but not normally. One year, the harvest was bad and we got really hungry.
My parents sent me to Nairobi to stay with my eldest sister, so I could go to school there. It was the first time I’d left home, and the bus took a whole day. I arrived in shorts; it was so embarrassing, because everyone was wearing trousers. People laughed at me when I got off the bus.
Life was tough in the big city. People are very sharp. Once, my sister sent me to the shop with 1,000 shillings (£7.50) and someone stole it right out of my hand. She was so angry. Another time, I saw the police shoot three young guys dead in the street, because they’d robbed a shop. I hid, because you never know if they’ll come and shoot you, too. The police should have just taken those guys to jail; they were just struggling to survive, like all of us.
My sister, who is a pawnbroker, couldn’t earn enough to look after both of us, so in February my parents sent me to my other sister, who’s a teacher in Kampala. Her friend Lara, the one who took on all the orphans, recently set up a charity called Fund A Future Uganda, and through that I got a sponsor who pays for my education. It’s much quieter here, and people are more respectful. There aren’t any drunk people or nightclubs stopping me from sleeping and studying. I have to work hard, because I want to be an engineer or pilot, and help my mum and dad.
I don’t think I’ll ever live in the village again, but I love visiting and seeing my friends. They got so excited the last time I went back. I gave them tips about operating in the city. You have to be keen, or robbers might kill you – that’s what I told them. And no shorts, of course.
To celebrate, I’m going to a pastane, a cake shop, with my friends after school. My mum and dad are going to pay me back. Izmir is a very relaxed place: from my classrooms, you can see the sea. After school, we often go down to the waterfront and mess around. As a gift, I was given money by my extended family, about 200 lira (£45).
Turning 16 is not a big milestone here: all the important things, like driving a car, come when you’re 18. But I do have an important decision to make: at the end of July, I have to choose what specialism I’ll pursue at school. This affects your whole career and future. Most students want to be an engineer or a doctor, but I don’t know what I want to do. My dad’s a taxi driver and I don’t want to do that. I want to go to university. I guess I’ll decide based on my scores later in the year. I wish you didn’t have to choose at such a young age.
My hobbies are mainly sports and games: I just started playing basketball. I also like chess. I love to watch football, too: my team is Galatasaray, but I also follow the English game.
Technology has become so important. I have a mobile phone, a laptop and a games console. But these things are all so expensive because they are imported. And students here don’t usually get part-time jobs the way they do in other countries, so I rely on my mum and dad for money.
Politics in Turkey can be crazy, but I’m not really interested. In Izmir, we were lucky: on the night of the attempted coup in July, we didn’t hear warplanes or gunfire, unlike my cousins in Istanbul.
In general, I’m pretty optimistic and positive. My hopes for the future are simply to get a good job, an OK house and to have good friends.
I live in a high-rise, Soviet-era apartment block in a big government-controlled industrial port city in the east. It’s pretty close to the front line. I’ve tried to make my room more interesting with posters, photos, nice design touches. My parents divorced when I was two months old, and I don’t have any contact with my father. I don’t have brothers or sisters, but I’m very close to my mum.
For my birthday, she bought me a voucher to do a modelling photoshoot. She knows I’m into this, although I probably can’t model professionally due to my height. My perfect party would be a trip to another country with my friends – that would be amazing, because I’ve never been abroad. For now, we’ll just have a picnic. Turning 16 and 18 are big days for young Ukrainians, but families don’t always mark them with a special tradition. Some celebrate at home with family, others go to a cafe.
I love languages: English is my favourite subject, and I like reading and watching films in the original language. One of my biggest dreams is to visit America, maybe even live there one day. Without English, this would be an impossible dream.
My city isn’t the best place for me; many people here don’t want to improve their lives. It’s been difficult growing up here, plus I’m a bit of an outsider. My country faces a lot of problems: homophobia and ethnic tensions are big challenges, and we have corruption, propaganda and war. Fortunately, all my relatives are alive and my home wasn’t damaged by fighting, but I know lots of people who lost close ones, lost their homes, their jobs. It was strange when I realised I could work out which weapons were firing just by the sound, as was seeing people go about their lives despite the fighting. Most of us now aren’t even afraid. Artillery strikes have exploded close to my school and lessons weren’t even cancelled.
Every year I tell myself, “OK, it’s a new year, I have to change something.” And I really try to do something that makes my life better, that changes it. But, unfortunately, so far nothing’s changed. It’s a big fear for me that nothing will.
It’s a family tradition to go camping in the woods for my birthday, but this year, I thought it would be cool to throw a big “sweet 16” party. I had 100 people. I hired a hall, a DJ and a photo booth. I bought cake and finger food.
I wore a black-and-gold dress. A girl on my school volleyball team wore it for her homecoming last year, and let me buy it off her pretty cheap. I work part-time at a pizza joint, and while my family’s financially stable, the party was expensive, so Dad and I split it. We’ve spent about $400 each. The only other big parties I’ve attended were quinceañeras: lots of people at school are of Mexican descent and have a big party for their 15th. My school is diverse and I really like that.
Turning 16 feels like you get more freedom and responsibility. My parents are separated and I’m not that close to my mum any more, but I have a good relationship with my dad, and he trusts me. I’ve always been more mature than the people around me. I can get my driving licence this year, so I’m saving for a car. I’m excited, because I’m sick and tired of asking everyone for rides or walking. Where I live is quite suburban. It’s a block from school and a few blocks from work. The main thing to do here when you’re bored is go out and get food. It gets brutally, bone-chillingly cold in the winter, so we’re often indoors then.
I’m online a lot, mainly Twitter and Snapchat. My dad has a Snapchat, but I’m not friends with him. I have a close group of friends, and whenever we have sleepovers, we’re all just sitting there on our phones. Sometimes you look up and it can feel sad that we’re not laughing or talking. I wish it was different, but it’s just the way it is.
I’d have liked to have voted in this election, but Indiana always goes Republican. My older brother didn’t want to vote, which I didn’t like, and Dad didn’t make it in time. But my grandmother wanted to see a woman president. What upsets me about Donald Trump is that his demeanour causes violence and fear. His presidency will change this country and I’m scared to see it.
I hope to go to college and do something in the medical field. I’m proud of where I’m from, but I’ve never travelled farther than Chicago. I’d love to go somewhere tropical – maybe the Caribbean or Australia. I want to get out and see the world.
In Syria, 16 is like any other age. You’re considered a child until you’re 18, and you live with your family until you get married or go to university. But it feels special to have been born in 2000.
I live about six miles north-east of central Damascus. The area is controlled by groups fighting against Assad. Since October 2013, we have been under total siege by the Syrian regime. Life here is very scary, because of shelling and bombardment. Many things have moved underground to escape the bombing: my school is in a basement. When there are air raids, I hide in the middle of our house until it’s over. I try to cope with the stress by hanging out with friends and playing on the computer. When the generator is working, I like to watch wrestling on TV.
I remember my birthdays before the war: my family would prepare a big cake with candles and we’d eat pizza and fizzy drinks. This year, I’ll celebrate with my family as usual, but we will just have a small cake and some fruit juice. Even a tiny cake costs about 2,500 Syrian pounds (about £9.50). I won’t get any other presents.
My plan is to finish my studies and get a degree, then I hope to work as a trader in a big sweet shop. I dream of owning a farm, my own car and house. Or perhaps I will leave Syria and move to Saudi Arabia. My parents and I went to the holy city of Mecca before the war. I was amazed by the luxury.
My big hope is that this year, my life, and life for everyone here, gets better. I hate Assad: he kills civilians just to stay in power. I could not accept him staying as president, but I would accept an end to the fighting to stop the killing. I feel hopeful. I think it won’t be too long now.
My birthday wish is to be more independent; I don’t want to keep relying on my parents. I hope I’ll be able to push on with my studies, and have a good relationship with my parents and classmates. Turning 16 should mean I’ll have more rights, but I’m not exactly sure which ones they are. It’s pretty much the same as any other birthday.
Hangzhou is a beautiful city. The economy here is developed; the G20 summit was held here earlier this year. I am going to celebrate my 16th with my classmates and teachers. They will write cards to me and sing me a birthday song – just a normal party, pretty much like anyone else’s.
I feel happy about being a teenager. Our generation is much more open-minded than the previous one. We pay close attention to all the latest trends. I am looking forward to being treated like an adult, but right now I am still a student and my first priority is to study. Compared with other countries, I think Chinese teenagers pay more attention to their school work and are more focused.
I want to be a computer whiz in the future. My dream is to study computer science at Zhejiang University. When I was a secondary-school student, I went to a technology festival and it made me interested in that kind of thing. I think it’s pretty cool. Writing code helps train your sense of logic. It stimulates your brain to come up with different and unusual ideas. I think the whole process of programming is fascinating.
My parents are ordinary workers. When I was a kid, they’d give me birthday presents, but these days I don’t expect them to give me anything. I am the only child in the family. They respect me and give me space to pursue my dreams.
When it’s a family birthday, we always do the presents in the morning and have a nice breakfast, then have a mini tea party in the afternoon. This year, I’m having a sleepover with some of my closest friends. There’ll be 16 of us, including me, so we’re taking over all the bedrooms. Me and mum have ordered a load of funny games online, and we’ve got silly things to put on our faces. My nana’s farm is next door, and she has a huge trampoline, so we’ll probably walk over there. I haven’t asked for anything special present-wise, because I know it’s going to cost a lot with all the food and things for the party; it would be nice just to have a bit of money to buy some new clothes.
I guess it’s a milestone, turning 16. You can smoke, but I’ve never thought that was a good idea. I’m excited about getting my national insurance number, though. I’ve just applied for some part-time jobs. And I’m getting closer to being able to drive, which is important where we are. It’s no fun walking down the hill in the rain trying to get a lift.
I do think it would be good if 16-year-olds could vote. We’ve just done a group presentation in our English class about all the propaganda around the EU referendum. I would have preferred to stay – I’m nervous about what’s going to happen now.
I wouldn’t say I’m a big worrier, but there are things I get anxious about. I worry about exams, because I struggle to write neatly, and I work myself up over it. Right now, I’m trying to revise for my maths GCSEs in November, so I do around an hour and a half of revision every other day, then I’ll step it up to two hours.
I love musical theatre, and I go to drama school twice a week; I was the Artful Dodger when we did Oliver! earlier this year. I’d love to be an actor, professionally, but it’s really hard to get into, so I’m going to get a back-up plan. I’d like to be a human rights lawyer. I got selected as head girl at the end of last term, and one of the things I help organise are meetings about our rights, called the Big Conversation. We talk about things like our right to be safe and the right to privacy.
I think one of the things I’d like to change is how people judge others so quickly. I have a friend who wants to be a girl, and I know it was really hard for him sometimes, not knowing what people thought of him. He’s spoken to the school and they’ve been really good about supporting him with what he chooses to wear.
There are some people who claim they enjoyed their teenage years. These people say – and I swear this is true: I have actually met them – that the years between 13 and 18 were “a laugh”, “brilliant”, even “the best years”. I’m happy for these people, I really am. How marvellous to look back on your youth and see the extended director’s cut of Happy Days, Gregory’s Girl, Beverly Hills 90210 or American Pie (delete as appropriate to the decade of your youth). But those people? They are not my people.
I was not good at being a teenager. I lacked both the fearless sense of rebellion and the carefree desire for fun you need. My teenage years were spent alternately hiding in my room because I was so miserable and anxious about everything and nothing, and hiding in various psychiatric hospitals when that misery became life-threatening. Like I said, Ferris Bueller I was not. I wasn’t even Angela Chase in My So-Called Life. I was more like Angela’s history classmate, whom you never saw on screen because she was too busy self-harming at home.
And for a long time afterwards, I worried I’d ruined my life when it had barely begun. Ever since movies, pop music and TV started mythologising the teenage years in the 1950s, there has been a sense that those years matter enormously. From James Dean to John Hughes, pop culture has pushed the idea that being a teenager has some kind of mythic grandeur to it, and that if you do it right it will resonate into your adult life – save you, even, from the banality of becoming average. Your teenage years are when you forge the person you will be, the cliche goes, when you learn how to drink alcohol, have sex – not be a child, in other words. No wonder they’re so important. But all I did with mine was hide from the world.
Well, teenagers of the 21st century, I am here to tell you something: none of this is true. That is not to say that any emotions you feel now don’t matter – of course they do. But they won’t, in all likelihood, dictate the rest of your life. You will be an adult for far longer than you were a teenager, and any adult who considers their teenage years to have been their peak is always a bit odd. (The only man who ever said that to me was a 32-year-old snowboarding instructor who went by the name of Malibu and pursued 17-year-old girls. So there you go.)
Who you are now is not who you will be. How I wish someone had told me that. And despite what pop culture might tell you, who you are now is not the best of you. You are still clay, taking shape; no wonder you feel disoriented. If you are the kind of teenager I was, or perhaps a less extreme version, let me tell you something else: this too shall pass.
But I do have three pieces of advice for making it pass a little more painlessly. First, create something. Write, draw, bake, knit, make a magazine, design a video game – whatever, it doesn’t matter, as long as it comes from you. Just make something that wasn’t there before, so you can look at it and say, “That came out of my brain, my fingers, me. Without me, that would not exist.” One of the best ways to learn who you are internally is to find out what kind of mark you can make externally.
Second, do things just for you. I’m sure you’re sick of condescending oldsters like me wagging their fingers at you about “the selfie generation”, which is just our way of trying to say how worried we are about you coming of age at a time when your worthiness is measured in likes. But try to do as much as possible just for yourself, not external validation: make something and don’t Instagram it. Go to a gig on your own, and don’t Facebook it. Validate yourself.
Finally, remember that you are currently wearing teenager goggles. This means that everything you are experiencing is being refracted through the crazy hazy hormonal moshpit in your head, as well as the various injustices that come with that time of life when you’re not sure if you’re an adult or a child and no one else is, either.
Your confusion is not misplaced; this really is the weirdest time of your life. But here’s the good news: the best is just around the corner.
I was head-over-heels infatuated with a boy from the age of 12 until just a few weeks ago. He was three years older, so understandably had little interest in me at a younger age. But he soon become interested in my strange interest in him, and an unlikely friendship blossomed. We confided in each other for years, and I saw him through his drug problems that never seemed to go away. His life was falling apart, and only in retrospect can I see the impact that had on mine. It was too much for someone my age to have assumed responsibility for. But I think of him often and the effect he’s had on my life. I thank him for teaching me how love feels.
My sexuality is something I’d like to be happier with. By definition I’m bisexual, but it still feels weird to label something so personal to me.
I lost my virginity simply to get it out of the way. I feel as if it’s a social construct made to shame women. The pressure of losing it to someone I actually cared about seemed overwhelming, so at 16 I slept with an *ahem* experienced 19-year-old whom I would never have to see again. Sometimes I regret it, because weirdly enough, I do feel different now. But I’m kind of glad it’s gone. Romance is dead anyway.
My first crush was popular, and I was not; I was chubby, awkward and weird. I felt like I was obsessed. I still find him attractive, but now it’s him who tries to pull me. Swings and roundabouts.
My first ever kiss was drunken and awkward, but my favourite first kiss with someone was also the best night of my life. We were high and I don’t remember half of it, but I do have the clearest memory of us kissing for the first time outside the supermarket. He’s ignoring me now.
I’m half in a relationship; I’m talking to multiple people, but really there’s only one I want to be with. I sometimes wish things were like the olden days, when everyone courted, or whatever. At least you know where you stood.
My first crush was my best friend in primary school. We still keep in touch. I’ve since told him about my infatuation, and he told me that the feeling was mutual. Although I didn’t have feelings for him when he told me, some eight years later, the litle girl in me squealed with excitement, a thought that still makes me smile.
I was with a boyfriend for two years, and I stayed madly in love with him for that period of time. He broke up with me three days ago; he said he no longer felt the same way. It has truly broken my heart – at least I think so. My parents say I’m too young to be heartbroken, too young to know how it feels. I don’t agree, and their lack of support makes me feel lonely at a very difficult time.
I’m not sure if I will get married. The idea scares me. Marriage would be nice, I think, but not essential. A piece of paper doesn’t create a lifelong commitment; love does.
I’ve been in love but how much at different times, I don’t know, but as you get older it seems more real. Even though a break-up was something mutually agreed upon it was still heartbreaking and depressing more than anything else. All the things we could have done, all the things I wished I had done.
Strictly speaking, my first kiss with my girlfriend was a quick peck over a kissing gate, but half an hour later we properly made out which I prefer to think of as the first. It was incredible even though it was the first time either of us had done anything like that. It was like floating in a heavenly daze. Honestly the most amazing feeling ever.
Relationships are both amazing and hard – it’s hard with little experience to know what to do, how to be – I guess you should just be yourself but that’s harder than it sounds.
My first heartbreak was a horrible experience: I liked this guy so much, it made me feel sick. If we didn’t speak for a day, I would feel sad to a point where it almost manifested as actual pain. When we fell out and didn’t speak for a few months, I didn’t really know how to function.
As I’ve matured, I’ve taken on the outlook that this person will either be with you for the rest of your life, or it will inevitably end. Both prospects terrify me. So I’d rather stay single. I think I am pretty confident in my sexuality, although I think a more fluid sexuality is accepted now. Like, occasionally I will see a girl I’m attracted to, but I think everyone does – right?
My first crush? I wouldn’t touch him with a bargepole now. I wouldn’t say I’ve had my heart completely broken, but it’s certainly been tossed around. I’m not the type of person to sit and weep, though: I just get angry. I focus on other things – anything – and realise that I’m gorgeous in my own right. I don’t need a guy to tell me I’m beautiful, because I damned well know it.
All my friends think I’ll be the last to settle down, get married, have a child – and I think that’s true. I want to travel, to live, to be my own person without, in part, being defined by someone else.
A combination of hormones and friends brought us together, and after nearly six months I feel a glow when I’m with my crush, and a longing when she is gone.
I always assume I am in love, but how can I be sure when I have nothing to compare it with? My first kiss involved too much vodka. My relationship is quite bizzare. We are always connected digitally; we talk nearly 12 hours a day, but when we are together, we are very physical. I would like to get married, but not for a very long time.
My first crush was a girl at my school. I’d never seen such a beauty, and I’ve been interested in people before, but she was unique. I always found ways to talk to her, even though I knew she’d never love me back, because she’s straight. Failing to keep her out of my mind is a routine I go through every day.
I haven’t had my first kiss yet, but I plan to. I have been romantically interested in some people, but when I tell them, I face immediate rejection. This is mainly because people are bi- or homophobic. But my heart has an incredible ability to heal.
I can remember very early romantic interests of which nothing ever came. I didn’t have my first proper girlfriend until I was 15. I’m currently in a relationship, with my best friend of four years, and I can say I am in love. We both can. I think telling someone you love them is an important thing, but not as ceremonious as some may think. I would definitely like to have children one day, and probably get married; this is something we’ve discussed. It’s nice to think I might have found “The One” at such a young age.
I was very scared when it first came to kissing. I always made sure to chew some minty gum beforehand and brush my teeth. But when it came to my first actual kiss, it was probably the most exhilarating thing and I just lost all of my fears. It took place in a bathroom at my friend’s house (he was having a party). That doesn’t sound very classy, but I’m still with him up to this day. Being in a relationship at the age of 16 is comforting, knowing that you have someone with you, going through the same things.
My first kiss didn’t feel sexual, but more like it signified that the other person trusted me and I trusted them. It was a feeling I won’t let go of for the rest of my life – it was something that lasted mere seconds but felt like forever.
I am unsure whether to say I have been in love. I certainly felt I was after my first relationship. Countless months of tears, loneliness, late nights pondering why she didn’t just talk to me about the problems we had, really put into question whether I was just obsessed with the idea of this girl.
I didn’t know I was gay until I was 14. I realise now that the reason I was so fascinated by my year 8 English teacher was because she was beautiful and ever-so-slightly butch.
My first kiss was with a boy. He kissed me very suddenly, and I couldn’t work out why I hated it. In my first relationship with another girl, I wanted to be the perfect lesbian, so I lied a lot. When she found out, she broke up with me very suddenly, and it hurt.
I love my relationship now. It’s like having a best friend who’s closer to you than anyone else, someone who takes absolute priority because she’s just perfect. She’s cool and pretty and funny. But it’s kind of humiliating to be in a serious adult relationship where your mum still has to drop you off places and give you an allowance.
My first crush and I got pretty serious without ever being in an official relationship. He was my first kiss, he took my virginity, he was my first for a lot of things. It meant a lot to me, but to him I was just another girl; he was just bored. Eventually, he ghosted me and I was really heartbroken for a while.
Now I’m in a relationship with the best guy I could ever ask for, and we’re taking things relatively slow. He’s never been in a relationship before – neither have I, really – so this whole thing is new to both of us; we don’t want to mess it up.
My current boyfriend and I have done sexual things, but we haven’t gotten all the way there. He’s a Christian, so he kinda believes in the whole “no sex before marriage thing”; but in his opinion, if you intend on marrying that person, it’s fine. Although it’s not statistically likely, at the rate we’re going, we could get married in the future.
My first kiss sucked, literally: it was as if he was trying to suck my soul out. It lasted, like, eight seconds before I pulled away and told him I had to go home. I was grossed out.
I am in an eight-month relationship right now, and I’m beyond happy. It’s unlike anything before. I met him on Instagram after he commented on a meme I had posted. We began talking, which slowly turned into eight-hour phone calls and endless texting. We met six days after we began texting, and he asked me out exactly a week later. Sometimes when I can’t sleep at night I just get so happy thinking about him, thinking about us. I never knew this was possible.
We are about to tour colleges together. I can’t imagine not being with him. I love the comfort I find with him, and I love how we leave our comfort zones together. He is also the only guy who has made me orgasm.
I remember everything as if the memories are accessible on an HD screen. There was a month of not knowing; it was new and exciting, followed by the official question, “Will you go out with me?” in a dark church garden in the biting cold.
I think it’s a shame we met so young, considering the odds are against us lasting. In the middle of March, on a Tuesday, we were hugging in dressing gowns, he came behind and rested his head on my shoulder as we looked into the mirror on his wardrobe. The words “I think I love you” barely escaped his lips and that memory is one I wish I could relive now.
We broke up. And got back together (for 12 hours). And broke up. And got back together.
My first crush is the one I have now. I don’t know if it’s love, as I’m not really good with these things, and I’m finding it especially difficult as she is a girl and I am too. But she’s beautiful, intelligent and I love listening to what she has to say. I am always amazed at how wonderful she is.
I think I am bisexual because I feel sexual attraction towards both sexes. I’m not in a relationship but I totally despise the idea of marriage. I don’t have anything against people who want to marry, but for me, it’s just a stupid tradition that I don’t need in my life.
My first crush was on my current girlfriend, who’s also 16. We texted nonstop for just under a month before I acknowledged it. As someone who didn’t like many people at school (it was always mutual), it was refreshing to have someone to talk to and share the stress with. It was dizzying. My friends told me to stop talking about her at least twice a day.
Being in a seven-month-long relationship, I feel it’s safe to say that I am in love now. In a word, I’d say being in love is tiring. I get less sleep from late-night texting and calling.
I think young people are the biggest culprits when it comes to exaggerating all things in love and sex (bar musicians). People, myself included, aren’t that complicated; the relationships we have aren’t that complicated, either.
The idea of kids’ food or teenage cooking is not a natural one for me. When I was growing up, I simply wanted to eat what my parents were cooking: there just wasn’t the option (or desire) for a separate and bespoke service. It’s only in recent years that I’ve realised how lucky I was to take this togetherness for granted. For many people, feeding children can be complex – traumatic, even – but I’m yet to be convinced that having a kids’ menu in a restaurant, or routinely offering to cook something different, is the way forward.
It’s the same with cooking. If you grow up regarding it as something that only grown-ups do, it’s no wonder so many teenagers come to “proper” cooking really late in life. I find it amazing that we’ll happily teach our teenagers to drive a car before a lot of them know how to work the oven.
I’m not suggesting that, out of the blue, you ask your 16-year-old to whip up a tandoori paste, rub it over a chicken and make Sunday lunch; but for any curry-loving teenager, the possibility should not be dismissed out of hand. Making things yourself – seeing the ingredients, how they are combined, why the end result looks the way it does – helps demystify the cooking process. If you can read, you can cook. And if you can cook, chances are you’ll be more receptive to trying out a much wider range of foods than teenagers are often given credit for.
This takes less than 10 minutes to make, and keeps well in the fridge for at least three weeks. These quantities make about 300g paste, so there’ll more than enough to make all three of today’s recipes. It’s easily doubled (or more), if you want to try it out on other things: on cubes of tofu or paneer, say, or root vegetables for roasting. The paste also works well as a curry base: just mix some with plain yoghurt and use as a marinade for cubes of meat or fish before they are grilled.
Put the chillies in a small bowl, cover them with boiling water, set aside for five minutes to rehydrate, then drain.
Put the cumin, coriander, peppercorns, cardamom and cinnamon in a small frying pan on a medium heat, and toast for three to four minutes, until the spices start to brown and go aromatic. Grind to a powder (I use a spice grinder), then tip into a small food processor bowl. Add the rehydrated chillies, 90ml cold water, all the remaining ingredients and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and work for a couple of minutes, until you have a smooth paste. Refrigerate until ready to use.
In a large bowl, mix the paste, yoghurt, lemon juice and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. Add the chicken and rub it all over with the mixture, until well coated, then set aside to marinate for at least an hour (or overnight in the fridge, if you’re preparing this in advance).
Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Put the chicken in an oven tray lined with baking paper – you need a smallish one, so it fits snugly – and brush (or rub) all over with oil. Roast the chicken for 25 minutes, then baste, cover with foil and roast for another 45 minutes, basting twice more. Turn up the heat to 210C/410F/gas mark 6½, remove the foil and roast for a final five minutes.
Remove the chicken from the oven and leave to rest at room temperature for five to 10 minutes. Serve with any pan juices and the coriander sprinkled on top.
These sweet, spicy prawns and pineapple are gorgeous with the crunchy iceberg lettuce. Make sure you scrape all the cooking juices from the baking tray into the salad, so you get all the flavour. Toast the mustard seeds in a small pan on a medium heat, until they just start to pop. Serves four.
1kg tiger prawns (ie about 20 prawns; defrosted if frozen), peeled but with the tails intact, and deveined 
60g tandoori paste (see first recipe)
1 large garlic clove, peeled and crushed
Salt
2 tbsp groundnut oil
½ medium pineapple, peeled, cored and cut into 1cm-thick rounds
2 tbsp lime juice, plus 1 lime, quartered, to serve
½ large iceberg lettuce, cut into 3cm wedges
10g basil leaves
1 tsp mustard seeds, lightly toasted
Put the prawns, two-thirds of the paste, the garlic, a third of a teaspoon of salt and a tablespoon of oil in a bowl, mix to coat and put in the fridge to marinate for an hour.
Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Put a ridged griddle pan on a high heat and ventilate the kitchen. Once the griddle is very hot, grill the pineapple slices in batches for about a minute each, turning them halfway. Once all the fruit is grilled and cool enough to handle, cut each slice into 10 little triangular wedges and put them in a large bowl.
Put the prawns on the griddle and grill for a minute, turning them once halfway, until blackened on both sides. Add the prawns to the pineapple bowl with the remaining tandoori paste and a tablespoon of oil. Toss to coat, then spread out on a medium oven tray lined with baking paper, and roast for five to seven minutes, until the prawns are just cooked through.
Spoon everything into a large bowl – make sure you get every last scrap and all the juices – then add the lime juice, a quarter-teaspoon of salt, the lettuce, basil and mustard seeds, and toss. Spoon on to a large platter (or into individual bowls) and serve at once with the lime wedges.
These are gorgeous: serve just as they are as a side, or maybe with plain yoghurt, or turn them into a starter or light meal in their own right by serving with a bowl of rice. Serves four as a side dish.
1 large cauliflower (1kg), leaves left on, first cut in half vertically through the root (so each half stays intact) and then each half cut vertically into 4 thick wedges 
50g ghee
50g tandoori paste (see first recipe)
1 small preserved lemon, seeds discarded, flesh and skin finely chopped
1½ tsp honey
Salt
30g flaked almonds, lightly toasted
Heat the grill to its highest setting.
Put the cauliflower in a large bowl. Put the ghee, paste, lemon, honey and half a teaspoon of salt in a small saucepan and put on a high heat. Stir until the ghee melts, then pour over the cauliflower wedges. Mix well (don’t worry if the wedges break up slightly), then arrange on a large oven tray. Put the tray under the grill about 10cm away from the heat source, and cook, turning regularly, for about 25 minutes, until charred all over and cooked through.
Put the charred cauliflower wedges (and any bits and pieces that have broken off) on a large serving plate, scatter over the flaked almonds and serve hot.

It’s understandable that teen skincare products are geared towards problem conditions such as oiliness and acne, but this default assumption doesn’t apply to all. Many teens, while probably keen to avoid or treat blackheads and spots, seek a solid maintenance programme that keeps skin comfortable, not too shiny and well prepped for whatever makeup they might choose thereafter (in my experience, those with the least need for foundation are the most desperate to wear it, however much one preaches that this is probably the loveliest their skin will ever look). In such cases, I almost always recommend Sam Farmer skincare. Unisex, gentle, ethical and fairly priced (from £3.50), it seems to go down well with most young people, including my eldest son, who’s on the brink of teenhood. The travel pack makes a great stocking filler, and the packaging, very different from anything parents might own, is appealing to proprietorial teens.
Similarly ethical (and modern teens do seem to care about this stuff) is Green People’s Oy, a vegan-friendly range (from £8.50) without sulphates and alcohol (both of which are drying) and parabens (preservatives we eat in our food and on which I’ve yet to see any clinical evidence that compels me to avoid them in cosmetics).
Even big brands are rethinking ingredients for their youth ranges. Olay’s new 2in1 Hydration products, all targeted at young people, ditch the mineral oil that so frequently causes problems for spot- and oiliness-prone teenage skin, and instead focus on proven hydrating ingredients such as hyaluronic acid. Radiant Glow Moisturiser Lotion SPF15 (£9.99) is a lovely day cream I’ve happily worn myself (there’s nothing to stop adults from using anything in the range). Its light-reflecting particles give the skin a subtle, glowy finish that may even encourage teens to hang fire on the foundation, or at least compromise on a tinted moisturiser. My go-to is always Sleek CC Cream (£8.99), a sheer base in four ethnically inclusive shades, each with a decent sun-protection filter.
The most important principle in skincare, however, is the same for teens as it is for those in their 80s. Cleansing twice daily with a proper balm, oil or cream cleanser, then buffing away with a clean, hand-hot cotton flannel, will help give you your best possible skin. No frills, no marketing, no expensive gadgets, just results.

I was 15 when I left Afghanistan. I still felt like a child, but I tried to act like an adult. The situation there was very difficult for me and my family; it’s a long story, but I left home because of the civil war and a family dispute. It took two months to get to France: walking, in cars and lorries, on a boat. We walked 15 hours through the mountains to cross the Iranian border into Turkey.
My 16th birthday came and went without me even realising. I was living in a tent in the refugee camp in Calais. I had a phone, but the connection was very bad and it was hard to charge it. On that day my family didn’t call. I didn’t celebrate my birthday much in Afghanistan, either: I’m one of seven children, and we faced problems from all sides; we didn’t think much about birthdays.
I was in Calais for seven months. For the first two, I spent most nights trying to get to the UK. I got on a lorry so many times, but every time I was taken off by the police; they hit my legs with truncheons. One time, I jumped from a lorry and broke my hand. It was very painful, but I didn’t go to hospital. I found a doctor in the camp who bandaged it. Then I met lawyers from the charity Safe Passage, who told me there was a legal way to join my sister in the UK. After that, I stopped trying to get on lorries and waited for a decision to be made.
There was a school in the camp, but when you don’t feel relaxed, you can’t take in the words. I was very depressed, and hungry. At first, there was only one meal a day; later there were two, but you had to be quick to get breakfast. Usually, I didn’t sleep at night – there was no law, no police in the camp. It was the same as Afghanistan: very scary and violent. After I got to London, it took weeks to get used to sleeping in a normal, comfortable bed.
I arrived in London by train on 7 April – I remember looking out of the window when we came out of the Channel tunnel. My sister and brother-in-law met me at the station, and we took a taxi to their home. There were so many people, so many nationalities. The men looked the same as they do in Afghanistan; the girls looked different. In Afghanistan, you should cover your head and your body, but it’s different here.
Now I’m studying at college, focusing on English and maths. My English is getting better, but sometimes I find it hard to understand British people. The school is much better than the ones in Afghanistan. In most of the schools I was at, the lessons weren’t good because of local government corruption; sometimes, I felt I was just wasting my time. Here, the teachers are nice. There are people from all over the world at the college – a few from Afghanistan, but most from eastern European countries.
I don’t go out much with them. After college, I go straight to the library to study, then I try to go to the gym. In Afghanistan, I was a very fast runner; but after a year of travelling, I wasn’t fast at all. At the gym, I’d get pain after running for just two minutes.
When I had days off school in Afghanistan, I’d play football and see friends, but my family wouldn’t let me go anywhere central, because there were so many Taliban attacks. It feels safe here. Sometimes, when I see the British police, I am reminded of the French and Afghan police, and feel scared, although I know they are different.
On Saturdays, I play football or go to my auntie’s. My brother-in-law has a wholesale business. We live in a house and I have my own room. The rooms are smaller than in Afghanistan, but I like it. Two weeks ago, my sister had her first baby, a boy. I still miss my country and my old friends. Sometimes I feel lonely, because I don’t have my family, my mother and father.
I’d like to be a politician, an accountant or a web designer. A few weeks after I arrived, I was invited to talk about my experiences to MPs in the Houses of Parliament. There was no translator, so I had to speak English. Slowly, as I spoke, it got easier. Later, I spoke in front of 500 people at the National Theatre; it was the first time I’d spoken in front of so many people. That’s when I thought I’d like to be a politician. I want to serve the country I live in. I want to make myself here, to grow my talents, and go back to Afghanistan at some point. If I was a politician, I’d focus on trying to stop the conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan. The UK is a world power; they can do something. If there was peace there, people would not need to flee here. I don’t know if they would accept me as a politician in the UK, because I’m foreign, but that’s what I’d like to do.
I feel awful for the boys I was with in Calais: most of them are still in France and in a bad situation – some have been waiting for eight months, a year, two years. One boy arrived in Calais at the same time as me. After seven months, his hair began to turn grey from the stress.
I don’t think I’m a child and I don’t think I’m grown up; I feel in the middle. My sister, who is 26, treats me like her little brother; she cleans my bedroom and tries to take the place of my mother and father. In Afghanistan, people don’t have the same idea about teenagers. By the time you’re 15 or 16, you should know how to talk to guests. In the UK, they treat you more like a child. When I got here, my sister and brother-in-law told me I should behave, be polite and study hard. They said if people offered me alcohol, I should not accept it. It wouldn’t be right to find a girlfriend: if you want to be with someone, you should marry her.
I have a great opportunity here, but my worries are not over. I don’t know how long I will be able to stay. They gave me an ID card and I’m waiting for my visa; the Home Office the case is delayed. Maybe they will give me a visa to stay for ever, but perhaps they will send me back. It makes me feel depressed when I think about it.

OK guys, the Christmas schedule you’ve all been waiting for – guys? If we can just huddle momentarily? So, as your hardworking Christmas hubmeister, I thought this year’s theme could be Best Christmas Evah, are we all OK with that? So that means it’s not just the company party, and the canteen lunch, and the children’s tea – btw can everyone reply, asap, David we’re counting on you for Father Christmas, if you want to practise your hohohos, I’m guesstimating XXXXL for your costume?
All team leaders should have the mince pie tokens by now, and for Secret Santa we’ll draw lots in a second, if we could have the presents under the tree by mid-December, and I’m suggesting minimum £25 spend, so everyone gets something nice – no sex toys, am I right John? And if you could do your wrapping in jewel colours, so it matches the new baubles – and I don’t want to nag, Noah, but the crib is usually in reception by now?
Going forward, anyone else think it’s time we did a festive desk competition? With a prize for the best decorations when the MD comes down for quiz night? We’ll keep the festive tombola, bottles in by Friday please, but individual desks would look so special, sure Sophia, low concept is fine, at my last work I did a simple but effective Lapland theme, with thousands of tiny trees and a real ice rink with a miniature train track and music from the Nutcracker – thoughts to me by close of play? Party-wise, anyone else think fancy dress would be a super way to break the ice?
So unless anyone wants to suggest a theme – no? – fine, mine was Elves and Safety Nite, geddit? Which gives everyone loads of options – sure Robert, don’t join in if you won’t feel left out – but the best news is, you’ll be needing passports, I’ve managed to relocate the entire event to a karaoke barn in the Pas de Calais! For just an extra £175 that’s return ferries, medieval burlesque act, overnight stay and two glasses of sparkling wine. Absolutely no pressure, if there’s anyone here who’s not keen on team-building, feel free to vocalise. Nobody? Great!
The paper has asked me for a photograph of myself at 16. I can’t find one: it is as if my chaotic archives had been cleaned out to eliminate all records of myself at an age when my adult dress sense was in the first full flower of its baroque glory.
In particular, shopping for myself, I had obtained a pair of oxblood shoes with quilt tops and foam rubber soles. Before I left the shoe shop I had already discovered that these rubber soles made a squelching noise. But I bought the shoes anyway, liking the look of them.
As I completed the walk to church the following Sunday, I noticed that everybody around the building was facing in my direction. It was because they had heard my shoes from half a mile off. That was the day when I finally abandoned my ambitions to attract the attention of Shirley Atwood, a petite beauty whose tiny round silk hat was always decorated with a fresh sprig of frangipani every Sunday. She had perfect taste.
Here, alas, was conclusive evidence that I had no taste at all. As I squelched towards her out of the distance, I could see her face: usually an enticing sight, but not when it looked as if she was watching a car-crash in slow motion.
My mother insisted that I went on wearing the squelching shoes until they wore out. I got away with them at school because the playground sounded like a war zone anyway, so a mere pair of squeaky shoes attracted no more attention than a couple of mice at the battle of Stalingrad.
There was also the matter of my flat-top haircut, which provided a distraction from the shoes. In that era, everybody at school had some variety of crew-cut except the headmaster, so one’s coiffure did not stand out even if it looked like an aircraft carrier for flies. But when I first turned up at church with that flat-top haircut, people doubled up and howled. Shirley Atwood was one of them. Already small, she vanished.
Bad taste is a destiny. It took me about 50 years to learn that I should dress as plainly as possible, and even then I had a tendency towards lime-green shirts.
Nowadays, as doom closes in, I already look as if I am dressed for my funeral. I have at last mastered the art of darkness. But somewhere in the background of my ebbing life those quilt-top shoes are probably still glowing. I never did succeed in wearing them out. They just went quiet. In my mind, though, their image lingers, like the unattainable flowers on Shirley Atwood’s little round hat, that shimmering disc from a distant galaxy of grace and judgment.
I live in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire; the Team GB cyclist Ed Clancy lives just down the road. Before London 2012 I’d see him out on the roads when I was riding. A few weeks later, he was winning an Olympic gold medal. I remember watching it on TV and thinking, “I want to do that.” My dad was a keen track cyclist already and took me along to the Manchester velodrome with him. Three years later we were racing against each other.
There are lots of different events on the track, from the scratch race to the Madison. I specialise in the points race: there’s a sprint every five laps and you accrue points by either placing in the top four in a sprint or lapping the entire field. There’s a lot to think about – not easy when the adrenaline is flowing and you’re going at 45mph.
Riding inside a velodrome is very different from cycling on the road. The tracks have incredibly steep sides, known as the banking. When you’re at the top, you’re almost horizontal – I found it a bit scary at first. In theory, you’re just riding in a straight line, but it never gets boring. You’re always at the limit of how hard you can go, always planning your next move. You have to concentrate; there’s a lot that can go wrong, especially as the bikes don’t have brakes – you can only slow down by pushing back against the pedals or swinging up the banking.
People often think of cyclists as being skinny, but you’ve got to be quite muscly to be a track rider. My thighs are pretty big compared with most of my friends’. In a points race, you’ve got to be able to sprint as hard as you can, rest for five laps, then sprint, over and over again. Towards the end, your legs are on fire.
I love riding on the track, and my dad loves that I’ve got into it. We compete in the same league every Friday. I usually do better – I’m first overall and he’s third – but sometimes he’ll still beat me. It’s just nice to be able to race alongside him.
How often do you ride? Six times a week, between the road, the track and the stationary indoor turbo trainer.
How many races have you won? I’ve lost count.
Favourite pre-race meal? I’m a big fan of my mum’s pasta with tomato sauce and mozzarella.
1 Track cycling is more accessible than ever. There are six indoor velodromes in the UK (Glasgow, Manchester, Derby, London, Newport and Calshot) and outdoor tracks, too. Find your nearest at britishcycling.org.uk.
2 You can’t ride your regular road or commuter bicycle on a track, but most velodromes will have bikes for hire. Outdoor tracks often have a club attached which will lend bikes to beginners, provide a support network and help structure your training.
3 Track bikes have a single, fixed gear (you can turn the pedals in both directions, but can’t freewheel) and no brakes. To stop, you simply pedal more slowly until you come to a standstill.
4 Track etiquette is similar to driving on the roads. The convention is to pass on the right, always taking care before changing direction. Look over your shoulder, then signal which way you want to move by flicking your elbow.
5 Don’t be intimidated by the power and speed of athletes at the Olympics. Every velodrome has a track league, so you compete against people of a similar level.

I never thought we would get here. This is such a cliche. Your son and I have been together for over five years. I always thought that we got along well. I had the impression that you were supportive of our relationship and I felt like you wanted me to be part of the family.
I also genuinely used to like you.
When you came to visit us recently, I was excited to see you. I thought that we knew each other well enough now to just be ourselves. I was looking forward to that.
You stayed in our flat, sleeping in the living room.
It all started when I wanted to do some exercise on my own and asked if you could continue reading in another room. You started shouting and packing your things. You said that we were treating you like a dog. How dare I ask for 20 minutes of alone-time.
You are an abusive person. That was the first time I got to see that.
Things calmed down later. I was seriously uncomfortable in my own flat, but I thought that you just had a bad moment and that you were going to contain yourself.
That was not true.
You started again the next morning. We were discussing some mundane thing about where to have dinner after work. You said that we were excluding you. How dare you treat visitors like that? This time I did not stay to listen to you shout in my own home. I just went to work and hoped that you would not be there when I came home.
This went on for the rest of your stay. After you left, I thought this would all be over. I could not have been more wrong.
You sent a long letter to your son containing only negative things about me. How I am selfish and arrogant. A person with no breeding or courtesy.
You constructed an absurd narrative where every small thing I did was a clear insult to you. How dare you. You came to stay in my flat. I cooked for you. I took time off work to show you around town. I tried my best.
Your words were so hurtful, they were stirring in both of us for weeks. I did not know that you had so much hate in you. So much hate for me. So much hate for our life.
The thing is, I pity you. I know that your life has not been easy. I know that you are alone. That you are getting old. I know that you sit around in the evening thinking about all the people you hate. I know that you are deeply unhappy. I know that you need help.
I feel truly sorry for you.
However, you are a person without limits. You know no bounds. I will not let you bully me. I will never crawl in front of you.
I promise that I will not hold what you did against you for the rest of your life. I promise that if you want to make amends, I will try my best.
However, the things you said will never go away completely. This will affect our relationship for ever.

Imagine Narnia’s evil twin; a place of darkness without talking animals or the gentle Aslan. A place overseen by the grim reaper and his sidekick, fucking cancer.
Entry into this grim world is not through a wardrobe, although it is via a piece of bedroom furniture. My bed is a thing of beauty. Purpose built some years ago, the brief to the surprised designer being “Bedknobs and Broomsticks, but in stainless steel, please.”
Despite the lack of a magical knob, I’ve discovered that it can transport me back through time – unfortunately it’s to Helen’s illness and death.
The night she died I started sleeping on her side, and still do. The clock is there and although I retire late, I always sleep well. One night, however, I moved back to the side I’d occupied for so many years. It was a shift of 3ft (it’s a big bed), but I might as well have thrown myself on to spikes.
When I looked across to the empty space that had been Helen’s side, my sense of loss was overwhelming. I shut my eyes, but the spikes dug deeper. I remembered what it was like to wake beside her for so many months, wondering whether this would be the day the pain started getting worse, the test results more negative or, in the latter period, seeing her ever-thinner body taking up less space under the same duvet. Like the drunk whose world starts spinning when they close their eyes, I start to feel despair breaking further through the wall that has kept grief at bay and allowed me to maintain the facade of: “Adam, you are coping so well.”
All this new torment I explain to Heidi, my recently recruited, very professional and calm counsellor. She asks gently, “What happened next, Adam?” I’m not sure what she expects – that I died? Was sick? Took up crystal meth?
My answer does, though, challenge her deadpan demeanour, her eyes flashing with incredulity. “I simply moved back to Helen’s side of the bed. Everything immediately returned to normal. Grief gone, solid walls of coping back in place.”
Saying this out loud makes me realise that this must sound crazy, but I’ve repeated the move several times since – shifted sides of the bed in a maelstrom of despair and then moved back and been immediately fine without even a lingering upset. So, once again, my life reads like some cheesy film script in which the inexplicable becomes the everyday.
I hadn’t reckoned, however, with Heidi. “OK, tell me why you really moved to Helen’s side of the bed?”.
She’s right; it would have been just as easy to move the clock. I explore long-buried memories. “My dad died when I was four and my mum told me she chose then always to sleep on his side.” In counselling terms, I suspect this hits pay-dirt as I continue. “Mum took over the family business a week after Dad died on Christmas Eve and coped extraordinarily well with three children under 10.”
Heidi digests all this and does her stuff. By the end of the session I’m pretty sure that I’m following a coping strategy imprinted since childhood. The deep black hole of misery at Helen’s death that I’d always feared was there, has been identified and so can be managed. That the gateway to this black pit is my own bed is unexpected, but not so much as my ability to move back to Helen’s side and be immediately fine.
This is big news. One of the reasons for my counselling, despite northern instincts to be a strong, silent type, was to find and vanquish my grief demons so they wouldn’t come back to rule me and destroy my ability to give Millie and Matt the lives they deserve.
So it’s with enthusiasm that I start to spend longer on the far side of the bed; like someone training for a marathon with ever farther runs. Each time the black hole threatens to engulf me, I return to safety and sanity by moving back.
That this works again and again is magic and tragic, two words probably familiar to CS Lewis. His book in which he faces his feelings about his wife’s death from cancer is less well known than the Narnia stories but probably more important to the man’s sanity. To write about grief is to cope with grief.
The little girl in the photograph is me. The curtains and my hair “style” give away the fact that it was taken in the 1970s. It’s perhaps not instantly apparent that it’s on board a ship. It was taken by my mother in the spring of 1970 from inside the cabin of the DFDS Seaways ferry that used to sail from Harwich to Esbjerg in Denmark. To me, it encapsulates the sheer excitement of going to see my grandparents.
On the back of the photograph, my mother’s handwriting is recognisably Scandinavian. Destined for a family album, the Danish words meaning “little girl looking out at the big ocean” capture the fact that even though she had lived in England for many years, she would use her native language to record memories.
My grandparents on my mother’s side were Danish and lived in Fredericia in Jutland. We would visit them every year. My father couldn’t join us, but although I missed him, it made it a special adventure for the two of us; a voyage to my Danish half. My grandmother spoke no English and though my grandfather did, I remember him as wonderfully familiar but “other” to my childhood mind.
Our journey had its ritual. We’d set off in one of those old Rovers that had the look of an overly inflated toy. From the outskirts of east London, my anticipation stretched all the way to the first sighting of the ship’s red chimney at Harwich. It was the beginning. We played I spy knowing there was only one thing to spy.
In the picture, in my pyjamas and full of up-beyond-bedtime seriousness, I am at my lookout post. My mother was behind me in the narrow cabin bed. I was awaiting one of the rituals of the sea. At midnight, the ship on the return from Denmark would sound its horn when it passed the one leaving England. I was awash with excitement.
Beside me is a troll toy in a bobble hat and appropriately seadog attire. I was never a fan of dolls, but I was inordinately fond of this one.
My grandparents are no longer alive and the Harwich to Esbjerg route ceased in 2014, after 140 years of service.
The photograph is somehow a tribute to all of them.

“He said, ‘In winter 1963 / It felt like the world would freeze / With John F Kennedy / And the Beatles.’”
The winter of 1962-63 was the coldest for 200 years in Britain. Freezing weather began before Christmas and lasted until early March with the snow lying on the ground for weeks, and rivers and lakes were frozen solid.
I was 10 at the time and living with my five siblings in a council house on a sprawling estate. My father had died from pneumonia in October 1962 and by January the following year, my mother, worn out with grief, worry and the numbing cold, succumbed to flu and a chest infection.
She lay for many days under a pile of old coats on the settee, close to the coal fire, the only source of warmth we had in the house. To make matters worse, our water pipes froze solid, so we had no running water. Our neighbour supplied us with a bucket of water each day which had to do for everything.
My older siblings went off to school on the bus each morning and two younger brothers attended their infant classes. I was still at the junior school, which was next door to our house so I could sneak home each lunchtime to make up the fire, boil water for tea and make a sandwich or heat soup for my mum.
After a few days of this routine, I was spotted leaving the school and reported to the teacher. Not knowing the circumstances or reason behind my truancy, she ticked me off very sternly and when she finished I burst into tears. In between sobs, I managed to say:
“Please, Miss, my mum is really poorly and we haven’t got any water. I just went to help her, Miss.”
“Good gracious me, child, why ever didn’t you say something before? Now you are to go home for as long as your mum needs you.”
Turning to the rest of the class, she asked for two strong, sensible boys and told them that before and after school they were to fetch water each day for us from the school.
Thinking about it now, I wonder why I didn’t confide in my teacher before; she was strict but kind-hearted. I think, like many families, we preferred to deal with problems ourselves as much as possible.
To our relief and joy, Mum got better and in early March, temperatures began to rise, the snow and ice rapidly thawed and water flowed out of our taps again.

Boil the potatoes, drain and mash. Add the egg and flour and bring together to make a firm dough. Knead gently until smooth and roll out to about 1cm thick. Cut into strips 1.5cm wide. Cut each strip into pieces of approximately 2.5cm and roll with the tips of your finger. Boil until they float and serve with homemade pasta sauce.
Coming from an Italian family, eating gnocchi was a regular part of my childhood. My sister and I would often help my nonna make them. Even though they were irregular shapes, she’d let them pass quality control. Eating gnocchi reminds me of Saturday lunchtimes with my family – parents, siblings, grandparents, uncles, aunts and cousins – squished around the dining table enjoying great food and animated conversations.
I remember the first time I took my boyfriend (now husband) to meet my nonna. She was an independent lady in her 90s, who insisted on cooking us lunch – homemade gnocchi. Little dumplings of fluffy pasta coated in homemade sauce, infused with basil and with loads of stringy mozzarella, which is an undetectable quality until you try to separate one of the gnocchi pieces.
He had never had gnocchi before, but obviously liked them as he finished off not one, but two platefuls – much to Nonna’s delight. It felt like somehow I was sharing my childhood memories with him. He looked absolutely stuffed. I didn’t know how to tell him that the gnocchi was just the first course! The shocked look on his face was priceless as two more courses came and went. He proudly passed the “man v food” Italian-style initiation … but spent the afternoon on the sofa in a gnocchi-induced stupor. I knew then that he was the man I would marry.

To the outside world, they were part of a crowd of teenage boys. They hung out together, went to parties and chased girls.
But out of the gaze of their parents and peers, 18-year-old Mathew Shurka and Mark had fallen in love.
For months, the pair hid the nature of their relationship but then, without warning, Mark rang Mathew to say he no longer knew if “the whole gay thing” was what he wanted. From now on, he couldn’t see Mathew at all.
Yet that explanation was far from the truth. For the previous two years, Mathew’s father, a New York businessman, had been paying for his son to undergo “conversion therapy” to “rescue” him from his attraction to other men. But when Mathew’s desire only intensified, and he confided the depth of his feelings for Mark to his therapist, it was decided that the relationship could not be allowed to continue.
Mathew says: “Unknown to me, my father met Mark and told him to call me and end our relationship without telling me why. As a young gay man still in the closet, Mark was so petrified, he agreed. When that phone call came, I was destroyed. He was my first love.”
Ten years on, Mathew, now 28, is an out gay man fighting to ban conversion therapy – a battle that may continue because vice-president-elect Mike Pence has previously appeared to support public funding for it.
But perhaps more surprising is the fact that Mathew has forgiven the father who betrayed him so totally.
We talk while Mathew is in the UK to give a lecture for the Forgiveness Project – an organisation that collects and shares stories to help people move forward with their lives.
In the US, conversion therapy has been outlawed for minors in just a handful of states. In the UK, all major counselling and psychotherapy bodies, as well as the NHS, have concluded that conversion therapy is dangerous and have condemned it. But it is not illegal and Mathew believes it is still happening underground.
From the age of 12, Mathew knew he was gay. “I created a double life. Though I was one of the popular kids, inside, I was suffering. So I’d use words like ‘gay’ and ‘faggot’, to show I belonged.”
Ironically, when he shouted “fucking faggots” at two local boys, who had been harassing him for a couple of years, during an argument, it was the trigger for him to come out, aged 16. The injuries from the beating he sustained healed, but Mathew was shaken on a deeper level. “I was falling for Mark at the same time as I was trying to look heterosexual to my peers. I was terrified I’d be found out so I started skipping school.
A few weeks later, his father took him for a drive. He asked what was wrong. Mathew cried and told him: “I’m not sure what my sexuality is.”
The response was what every gay young person coming out wants to hear. “He told me he loved me, no matter what.” But panic quickly took over the place of love and his dad started to look for a therapist to find out if it was all just a phase.
His father came across a state-licensed psychologist who subscribed to the widely discredited theory that some gay men form same-sex attractions as a way to make up for troubled relationships with their fathers, or because they have been molested.
“My dad bombarded me with every outdated stereotype of gay life there was. He said I’d never be happy, I’d live a promiscuous, empty life without real love, that I was more likely to commit suicide as a homosexual man. I was only 16 and I loved and respected my father. I believed him.”
The problem was, the sessions led to Mathew not speaking to his mother for three years: “The first guess was that I had too much of a feminine influence in my life from my mother and two sisters. So I was told to distance myself. I’d come down in the morning, eat the breakfast she made for me and leave without saying goodbye.”
But unlike her husband, Mathew’s mother was supportive. “She would say: ‘Matt, you’re gay. It’s OK.’ But I was policing myself. In response, I’d throw the biggest tantrums.”
But then, eight months after Mark was told to get out of Mathew’s life, Mark called and explained the real reason he had dropped out of sight. Mathew confronted his father, who insisted it was for his own good. “So I moved to LA to get away.”
Finally, over the next four years, Mathew started to see for himself that those dire warnings about gay life were unfounded. And in his early 20s, he returned to New York City, where he came across countless happy and successful gay people who made him realise there was nothing to be afraid of.
He also took a self-help course that helped him see his story in a new light. Mathew said that for five years after his estrangement from his father, he had a filter constantly running in his head which made him think his father wanted the worst for him. “When I stripped that away,” he says. “I saw it differently.”
Mathew called his father: “We took a walk. He then proceeded to give me the same speech as always. This time, I listened. I heard what he had to say. For the first time I got his pain. I saw he thought he’d been doing the best for me. I said: ‘Dad, I know what the world is and who I am. I’m going to take life as it comes and it’s going to be great.’ And he looked at me and said: ‘OK.’”
Since then, Mathew and his father have spoken every other day on the phone. They have reached a point of mutual understanding.
But beyond the ethics of a therapy that does little more than create feelings of shame and failure, Mathew believes his story is ultimately about forgiveness: “When I came to realise parents, therapists and old adversaries are operating out of fear, feelings of rejection or because they think it’s the best thing, I started to understand.”
Mark’s name has been changed

Be prepared. Pregnancy can be a very vulnerable time and antenatal classes throw up the scary know-it-alls early on – smile politely and avoid. It doesn’t help to hear stories of 36-hour labours, how only natural births result in real bonding and that breastfeeding is the easiest thing in the world, when we all know it’s a skill to be learned.
Identify the captain of industry. Every playgroup has one – either someone who is now primary carer after years in a high-flying career or someone who has waited all her life to be the perfect mother. They’re useful for chairing committees, organising outings and toy-scrubbing nights, making sure everyone does their fair share on the rota and booking a visit from Santa in plenty of time. Smile, be friendly, and tell them they’re doing a great job and move swiftly on.
Don’t compare. Parenting is a competitive sport for many – quite often for the captain of industry noted above – but don’t get drawn in. Sitting, crawling and babbling are just the start, while school is an endless series of possible pitfalls with everything from sport, popularity and exams up for comparison. Self-deprecation is an excellent weapon to bring the boasting to a swift end. With a cheerful “We’ve all got two left feet”, or: “I was always in the bottom half of my class!”, hopefully even the most child-centred parent will realise it’s time to stop shouting about little Johnny’s achievements.
Be pleasant. Don’t get involved in gossip, no matter how tempting. If another parent is decribed as bossy, praise their organisational skills. If nosy, point out how ready they are to help. Running the PTA like a dictator – my goodness, where would the school be without them?
Don’t be walked on. It’s often the same people who get landed with helping with school trips, volunteering at Brownies or helping to coach football. Don’t be mean and leave it to everyone else, but decide for yourself how much time you can offer and what you’re best at and then be firm. “I wish I could but I can’t” is sufficient; a long, rambling defence is just asking to have holes picked in it.
Your home, your rules. This can be hard, especially if visiting children are free range and you prefer to be in charge. It’s complicated by your children watching you hawk-like to make sure you’re being completely fair and by the possibility of offending any particular child’s parent. Avoid trigger points such as having visits continue into mealtimes if the visiting child doesn’t know that their bottom is for sitting on and instead wants to trail spaghetti bolognese across your new couch. Never apologise to other parents about the non-negotiables – be brisk instead and hope that sweeps them along. “It’s so good for children to tidy up together/be allowed three food dislikes/take dirty shoes off at the door.”
Their home, their rules. It works both ways, but from an early age make: “Please, thank you and thank you for having me” part of your children’s repertoire, even if you are that free-range parent. Self-expression is fine, but bringing up little princes and princesses who rule the roost just makes life miserable for them in real life until they learn manners for themselves.
Different discipline. This becomes even more important with teenagers, especially if their friends have parents who believe in drinking/smoking weed with their kids and handing them packets of condoms every time they leave the house, and you definitely don’t. Have the – tactful – conversation with the parents if you think they’re a big influence, rather than merely an embarrassment, but better to discuss the situation with your own teenagers and explain why you think the way you do.
Selective socialising. School fundraiser, sports day or coffee morning – sometimes you have to turn up for your kids. Be wonderfully sociable, chat to lots of parents, enthuse about the event and slide off after an hour. When it’s your turn, do it once a year, dilute with kids and make everyone welcome rather than suffer one-to-one encounters.
Admit you might be wrong. We can all be a bit precious when it comes to parenting, but having good friends in similar circumstances certainly makes it easier, so don’t dismiss every other parent out of hand. You can’t be the only delight out there.
Siobhan Dowd had breast cancer. Her sister Denise was looking after her and one day, when the time seemed right, they had “the conversation”.
“It came up when I was doing some of her personal care,” says Denise, a retired district nurse. “That’s always a good time to talk to people, because it’s quite intimate. Out of the blue, she asked, ‘How do you feel about losing a sister?’ And because it was out of the blue I said, ‘Terrible’. I actually got quite upset. But she was very calm. She didn’t try to make it ‘all right’.”
That conversation, and the spirit in which it is conducted, can make all the difference to families facing a death.
“Often, we are frightened to talk about something we don’t think we can face,” Denise says. “Siobhan was terrifically brave to raise the subject with me. We talked about what death might be like. She said she thought it would be like before she was born – oblivion. But she didn’t make the conversation all about her. It was about me. She had a big heart.”
And this was just one of many similar conversations started by the late children’s author. Because the book Dowd started writing as she was dying has now been turned into a major film, A Monster Calls, with exactly this kind of difficult dialogue at its heart.
Starring Liam Neeson, Felicity Jones and Sigourney Weaver, it’s exciting, sometimes funny, and features a stunning performance by the child actor Lewis MacDougall, whose own mother died a year before shooting began.
“When Siobhan was first unwell, my children were 12, 15 and 18,” Denise says. “At that time, they were asking questions like, ‘But she will get better, won’t she?’ And we hoped she would, at that time, so we could be quite positive. It was only a few months before she died that we spoke together as a family about the fact that it probably wasn’t going to be good news. It’s hard, the chipping away. A Macmillan nurse told me that with children as young as my youngest was then, you should only answer the questions they ask you. And gradually let them know that, no, she’s not going to get better.
“Adults sometimes find it harder to cope after a death. For children, it’s the impending doom, knowing that something terrible is going to happen. Something outside the scope of their experience. Siobhan was a very special auntie, and we’d been very open with our children about what was happening to her. But they were worried about the effect it would have on them, and on everybody around them – on me.
“Being with Siobhan at the end was terribly important for me. Then suddenly it stopped, and there was this void. Grief is a very lonely emotion. You can be surrounded by other people who are grieving. They can feel a similar pain, but can’t feel your pain. Sometimes it’s more intense and sometimes it recedes, and nobody’s at the same stage at the same time. But I have a close family, and two other sisters, Oona and Enda, and a terrific extended Irish family. The Irish are fantastic at dealing with death. They were on email, and on the phone. They were really good.”
The other thing Denise discussed with Siobhan was the book Siobhan had been commissioned to write. After the cancer spread, she was put on to drugs extracted from yew trees. She did well on these, for a time. “And she said, a lot of people want to write about their cancer, but I want to write about a yew tree …”
She came up with the outline for a book, focused on a lonely boy whose mother was dying. “She was so pleased she’d been asked to do it, and she had lots of good ideas,” her sister says.
After Siobhan died, aged 47, the editor who had commissioned the book received a manuscript from Dowd’s agent. It was short – the length of this article – with notes about what would follow. The boy had a name, Conor, and the tree would come to life to tell him stories.
The publisher and the agent decided to show this to another writer, Patrick Ness – like Dowd, a winner of the prestigious Carnegie medal.
Ness read it with an open mind. “I thought, wow, there’s real power here,” he tells me. “And I started to get ideas. It was thrilling.”
He took on the project and the book he wrote, based on Dowd’s ideas, became a huge success. Published in 2011, A Monster Calls was hailed as outstanding and exceptional, and won the most prestigious children’s book awards. Ness wrote the screenplay himself for the director JA Bayona, whose films include The Impossible, and The Orphanage.
Ness is often asked why he writes about dark subject matter for young people. “My answer is: you should read what teenagers write! They write much darker stories than any young adult author would be allowed to publish. I have no problem with that. And if they are thinking about these dark things then the immoral choice would be to not address that. That would leave them to think about these things by themselves. When you talk truthfully about what’s dark, you are believed when you talk truthfully about hope and possibility.
“I’m in my 40s. At my age, if you’ve been paying any kind of attention, you realise what’s important: to allow somebody to be who they are, and share what’s bothering them, and give them a safe space to do it, and some love and support. That’s just being a decent human. But people don’t always know how to do that with someone like Conor, who’s 12 or 13.
“I don’t think anybody in the story is acting badly. They’re all being as loving as they can. There’s nobody to blame here. Conor’s a clever kid who has figured out 95% of the truth, and there’s another 5% that is causing him trouble. And that 5% is acknowledging that you can feel contradictory things, and live with that. There’s a huge amount of anger inside grief, particularly if you are young. So Conor is angry about what he’s going through. Angry at himself, and angry at his mother – even though he knows that’s unfair.”
Sigourney Weaver, who plays Conor’s grandmother, and Felicity Jones (his mother), prepared for the film by talking to people who had been through something similar. They talked to oncologists and Macmillan Cancer Support, and visited a hospice. But MacDougall, as Conor, had already lived through something like his character’s experience: an only child, he’d lost his own mother, Fiona, aged 53, in 2013 after a long illness.
“I’d read the book,” says MacDougall, now 14, “so I knew what was going to happen to Conor. I discussed it with my dad, and I was happy enough to do it.”
Towards the end of the film, Conor admits to wishing it was all over, that the uncertainty and unhappiness might just end. Speaking that kind of truth is never easy, says MacDougall. “I think everybody knows what the truth is. But it’s hard to be honest, even with yourself. What Conor struggles with is that nobody is telling him the truth. He doesn’t have anybody he can turn to, and the monster becomes that person.”
Played by Liam Neeson, the monster tells stories that reflect obliquely on Conor’s troubles. “It’s important to have people around you who can help. Someone you can talk to. Being alone in tough situations is really not good.”
Did working on the film help MacDougall to see in a fresh light what he’d lived through himself?
“When I did lose my own mother, I was around Conor’s age, a bit younger. There were times before my mother passed, when she was in a bad way, when there was a possibility that she might not get through. And I remember vividly having conversations about it. I was very upset at the time. My dad told me, you know, ‘Your mum might not get through this.’
“So having lived through something a bit like Conor’s experience was helpful – to know what he was going through in any particular moment. At other times, on set, it did affect me because it was a bit close to home.”
Days before O’Dowd died, she set up a trust. The proceeds of all her books – including A Monster Calls – go towards bringing the joy of reading to disadvantaged young people, including many who have lost a parent or sibling. I ask MacDougall if he has any advice for them.
“Not to feel that you …” he begins, then stops. “Let me think.” After a pause, he speaks again. “With me, I didn’t get to have some kinds of experiences I’d have wanted, like in average relationships. Like picking up from school. So I would say to people, don’t dwell on what you didn’t get to do, but cherish the things you did.
“Obviously, when somebody close to you has passed there’s always going to be a time of being upset about that, and mourning, and that’s perfectly normal. It’s in a way quite healthy. You should just know that it will pass and you will end up looking back fondly on the memories that you have.”

Heathrow passport control did it in the end. As frequent travellers, we’ve often landed at 5am to see the non-EU queue snaking back to the runway. People from countries I didn’t even know existed stand there, miserably inching slowly towards the UK border and my wife, Kate, an American, was obliged to join them. Meanwhile, of course, I could sail through with my British passport.
So eventually she applied for British citizenship – or “subjecthood” as Kate called it, because if you pass the examination to become British you have to swear allegiance to the Queen and little Prince George, not the country.
Surprisingly, it’s been a very stressful experience for both of us.
First, there was the business of learning how to be sufficiently British to be accepted into the nation fold. I suppose I had assumed that by just observing me, Kate would have absorbed Britishness – by a process of national osmosis – but she had to buy a book that teaches you all the things that a foreigner needs to know.
Facts such as when Christianity came to Britain, how far it is from Land’s End to John O’Groats and how many Welsh assembly members there are (all things that had passed me by in my many years of exemplary Britishness). Kate also learned useful social tips such as the fact that British people “enjoy going out for meals with friends”, and that they never discriminate against those with a different sexual preference and that if a scantily clad British woman dances with you at a party she is not necessarily a prostitute.
The book was a fascinating mix of Brit-trivia, useful information and wishful thinking. My wife spent a lot of time at the kitchen table diligently going through it all. I was impressed by this, but the closer Kate got to being British the more serious it all became – and the angrier Kate seemed to get with Radio 4.
Of course, shouting at evasive spokespersons on the Today programme is an integral part of being British, but now as subjecthood loomed my wife did seem to be taking it increasingly to heart. The kind of ire Kate had reserved hitherto for the Republican party was now directed at the Tories. And her despair over the Brexit vote knew no bounds. “I’ve just paid £1,000 to get a European passport,” she moaned. “Now those assholes have voted it away!”
She even flirted briefly with Corbynism and made us watch the DVD of the movie Pride. We were both outraged – Kate by Margaret Thatcher’s treatment of the picketing miners; me by Bill Nighy’s Welsh accent.
A political gulf was definitely opening up between us.
And so it was, as Kate passed her subjecthood test and went off to County Hall to be welcomed into this great nation of ours by the lord-lieutenant of Oxfordshire, I’ve found that we’ve started avoiding political discussions and giving each other intellectual space in a new way. We may have a country in common now but that common ground has exposed a political divide. When I missed the local elections because I genuinely had no idea whom I wanted in charge of Oxford’s parking spaces, I was told that anything that went wrong in our postcode from now on was going to be my fault because of my deeply irresponsible attitude.
I suppose all these strong feelings about Britain had lain dormant while Kate was not British, but I’m seriously beginning to suspect I may have married an activist.
Our relationship will weather this shift, but it’s been a revelation – and a strain. I’m dreading the next general election. Meanwhile, we keep getting emails from Kate’s family in the States asking if they can claim asylum now that Trump has been elected.
Having the in-laws come to live with us might be a relationship shift too far.
The rules for a good drinks nibble are simple and finite: no plates, no crumbs, and a combo of fat, salt and spice so addictive that you can’t stop eating them until they’re all gone. And you want a dip in there too. Your recipes were right on the money. I just wish you’d been there to taste them with me: they did my bottle of bubbly proud.
I made Fadime Tiskaya’s addictive bites three times. First with filo, as she’d originally suggested. Then with puff and (because I was, um, distracted by a bear in my kitchen) the butter intended for the filo pastry in the filling – a truly excellent mistake. And lastly, with puff and the right filling, just to check. My conclusion is that: the bites are perfect every which way, but that I preferred them rolled in puff. And, butter being butter, the erroneous addition to the filling only made them better.
For the filling
100g feta cheese, crumbled finely
75g green olives, stoned and very finely chopped 
40g salted butter, chopped (optional)
½ tsp dried oregano
½ tsp dried thyme
½ tsp chilli pepper
½ tsp sumac
¼ nutmeg, grated
Sesame seeds, to garnish
1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Cover a baking tray with baking paper.
2 In a bowl, mix together the filling ingredients with a fork.
3 Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface and cut into 3 equal pieces. Along the long edge of one of the pieces, pile a third of the filling in a strip about 1cm wide, then roll the pastry and filling over to the opposite side, creating a long log. Repeat with the other two pieces of pastry and the remainder of the filling. Cut each log into 10-15 equal pieces.
4 Transfer them on to the baking tray, sprinkle with sesame seeds and bake for 15-25 minutes or until golden.
TwinnyDip, such elegance in a biscuit. I loved the fragrant sweet and spicy bite, and the crumbly texture. If I were making them for a party, though, I’d shape the dough into two logs, to make the cookies that bit smaller.
Makes 10-15
2 tsp fennel seeds
200g flour
30g caster sugar
A generous pinch of salt
115g unsalted butter, cut into chunks
A generous pinch of chilli flakes
1 In a frying pan, toast the fennel seeds over a medium heat until fragrant and just starting to colour. Toss the pan every now and then to prevent burning. Remove from the heat and set aside.
2 Sift the flour into a large mixing bowl. Add the sugar and salt and mix well. Rub the butter into the flour mixture until you obtain a breadcrumb-like texture. Add 1½ tsp of the fennel seeds and the chilli flakes and mix well.
3 Line a large baking tray with baking paper. Bring the dough together and shape into a soft log, about 4-5cm in diameter. Wrap in clingfilm and chill for at least 30 minutes.
4 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Remove the dough from the fridge and, using a sharp knife, slice into discs about ½-1cm thick. Place the cookies on the lined baking tray. Sprinkle over the reserved ½ tsp of fennel seeds and some more chilli flakes (optional) and bake for 15–20 minutes until the edges just turn golden brown. Remove the cookies from the oven and leave on the baking tray for 5–10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool.
Anna Thomson serves this pale green beauty with grilled halloumi dippers – an unbeatable combo while the cheese is still hot – but it would work just as well with chips, veg sticks, grilled pitta or sourdough toast. So many options.
Makes a big bowlful
2 x 400g tins artichoke hearts, drained
2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to garnish
Juice of ½ lemon
1 garlic clove, minced
½ tsp cumin
½ tsp salt plus extra to taste
Black pepper
A handful of parsley, finely chopped, reserving a few leaves to garnish
Chilli flakes, to garnish (optional)
1 Blitz all the ingredients in a blender/processor. Season with salt and pepper.
2 Drizzle over some olive oil. Garnish with parsley leaves and chilli flakes.
Left to her own devices, my three-year-old would have finished the lot here in one sitting, LeftoverLiz.
Makes a medium bowlful
½ tsp each of powdered ginger, cinnamon, paprika and coarse sea salt or fleur de sel
A few black peppercorns
300g butternut squash, peeled
Sunflower oil, for frying
1 Grind the spices together quickly, using a pestle and mortar to crush the peppercorns.
2 Slice the butternut squash thinly using a mandoline or food processor.
3 Heat a 5cm depth of sunflower oil in a wok or fryer. Add the squash crisps a handful at a time, frying until golden (about 4 minutes). Drain well on scrunched kitchen paper.
4 Toss with the spice and salt mix.
Bobby Ananta’s childhood treat, using leftover rice, is so much fun – actual rice crispies you make from scratch. The salt is a keeper too. I can see it working on roast veg or a poached egg on toast.
1 Finely grind the salt, makrut lime leaves, chilli flakes and black peppercorns with a mortar and pestle.
2 Shape the cooked rice into small lumps the size of a pound coin. Place evenly spaced on a baking tray lined with baking parchment and bake in the oven at 100C/210F/gas mark ¼ for 1 hour or until completely dried out.
3 In a deep frying pan, heat 5cm of oil to 170C/335F, then deep-fry the rice in small batches – they will double in size. Drain well on kitchen paper.
4 Drizzle the rice crackers from a great height with golden syrup until lightly covered, then sprinkle with the salt.
More dinner than drinks party to my mind, but delicious nonetheless. I love how Detoutcoeur Limousin makes mushroom in a cake a good thing.
Makes 1 loaf
1 tbsp cooking oil
250g mushrooms, finely chopped
1 large garlic clove, crushed
Salt and black pepper
200g baby spinach, fresh or frozen
115g butter, melted
3 eggs
180g natural yoghurt
225g plain flour
1½ tsp baking powder
120g grated cheese (any favourite strong-flavoured cheese; I used a mixture of cheddar and gorgonzola)
90g raisins
1 tbsp dill, chopped
1 Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6 and line a 1½ litre loaf tin with baking paper. Heat the cooking oil in a large frying pan. Add the mushrooms with the crushed garlic, salt and pepper and fry over a high heat for a few minutes. Spoon the mushrooms into a dish and set aside to cool.
2 Add the spinach to the pan and cook until wilted/fully defrosted and cooked through. Drain any liquid, leave to cool for a few minutes, then roughly chop.
3 Melt the butter in a saucepan or microwave, cool for a few minutes, then add to a bowl with the eggs and yoghurt and lightly whisk together.
4 Sieve the flour and baking powder into a large mixing bowl, make a well in the middle and pour in the wet ingredients, followed by the spinach, mushrooms, cheese, raisins, dill. Season. Mix, then pour into the loaf tin.
5 Bake for 50-55 minutes, or until risen and golden brown on top and an inserted skewer comes out clean.
6 Leave to cool for 10-15 minutes in the tin before removing. Serve in slices warm or cold.

When I started writing this column, my oldest son was 12. Last week, he turned 22. In a month, the middle one will be 19. The youngest, at 17, has just a few months left before he becomes society’s problem. Until recently, I’ve suffered from an embarrassment of teens, but suddenly I find myself facing a looming shortage.
As with any phase of parenting, one masters the art of raising teenagers – in my case, teenage boys – just in time for it to be of no use. But I have learned a few things over the past decade. A very few. These are all of them:
1) Every aspect of parenting a teenager stirs up memories of what it was like to be a teenager. This doesn’t happen with younger children – nothing about looking after a five-year-old reminds you of being five. But your adolescence clings to you like an old injury; you’ll be obliged to relive your shameful mistakes as your children repeat them. This sense of perspective is not as much help as it sounds; it just leaves you with feelings of sympathy that you must do your best to hide.
2) Adolescent boys have an overwhelming need to reduce their father from a figure of authority to a figure of fun. In particular, they spend a lot of time repeating stupid things you’ve said in what they think is an amusing approximation of your voice. This can be dispiriting, to say the least. Life got much easier once I realised it was part of my role as a father to allow my sense of humour to fail me on these occasions.
3) It is vital to create an atmosphere in which your teenagers feel they can be totally open and honest with you, because they are amazing liars. You may remember being a proficient liar at that age, but your children have grown up in a post-truth world you barely understand, and they know the value of persistent falsehood. If you think you can tell when your 16-year-old is lying to you, it’s only because that’s what he wants you to think.
4) As children progress through secondary school, your authority over them gradually diminishes, until you find yourself parenting on a consultancy basis. You may well recall this phase from your own relationship with your parents: the era of unsolicited advice. Now that I am the parent, I have come to realise that the tiresome lectures I keep feeling obliged to deliver are not simply a doomed attempt to reassert lost authority. They’re a punishment.
5) Even when your authority dries up completely, you still have money. A 19-year-old will jump through a lot of hoops for a tenner.
6) On occasion, teenagers do seek out firm parental authority in a bid to counteract peer pressure: they long to be told they can’t do something, because they actually don’t want to do it. But, as a parent, you have to learn to parse the subtext of their words, as in the following conversation:
“OK, so I’m off to that illegal rave now,” the teen says.
“Not sure of the address, but I guess I’ll just follow the police helicopter spotlight.”
“Just tell your little friends I said you weren’t allowed,” my wife says.
“Thank Christ,” he says, taking off his coat.
7) While there is no single secret to a happy life in a houseful of adolescent boys, I cannot overstate the importance of colour-coded underpants: white for one, grey for another, NY Jets-themed for the third. I somehow got stuck with horizontal stripes, but at least I know they’re mine.
My teen years were in the 90s, cradled between recessions. We had handkerchief-hem tops and UK garage and feelings, man. Well, I certainly did, and that’s why no photos of me as a teen survived – I burned them all in one spectacular fit of teen Sturm und Drang. But thank heaven for telly, which was full of beautiful (but still normal-looking) American teens talking it all out, long-winded and so damn emotional, too. For me, no one did it better than Dawson’s Creek.
The show was the creative baby of Kevin Williamson, but a fair few of us staked a claim, too: Dawson, Joey, Pacey and Jen sometimes felt as close to me as my real-life friends. Their trials became my own: shy Joey, with a need to please but terrified of falling short, was my Patronus, but I loved them all. Entitled and whiny Dawson; semi-damaged and charming Pacey; wild-child-with-a-heart-of-gold Jen. It was all magic for my eyes and heart. I laughed, I cried, my God, I pined.
I knew these “teens” (James Van Der Beek had to shave twice a day to look younger) weren’t like me in many ways, but they gave me a lexicon with which I could navigate my own life. The fictional town of Capeside had it all: unrequited, grandly declared love, family strife, mental illness, tortured sexuality and even a little light racism. It is the sound of my teenage years. I mean that literally: I bought the soundtrack on CD.
These days the cast is largely still working, a small victory in Hollywood, and the show is considered a modern classic. Sometimes I watch clips on YouTube. I still feel giddy every time.

Last week, my aunt got a phone call from my mum. “I’m destitute,” she said. “I have to sell my house as soon as possible or I’ll be left with nothing.” This came as no surprise.
My mum’s spending habits have been a cause of family concern for years – a source of tension, worry and, eventually, the elephant in the room that none of us had the energy to tackle head-on. Her financial situation is probably quite common. And I am certain some of you reading this will recognise yourselves in her story.
Mum is an intelligent woman with a university degree, who worked in a profession that brought in a very good salary for more than 30 years. My childhood was comfortable. We lived in a nice house in the country, ate out a lot, went shopping on Saturdays and bought things without hesitation. I certainly never had any suspicion that we were anything other than financially secure. Now, though, my mum’s financial CV makes a shocking read.
She has no real assets. Any equity in her house has been borrowed against several times and, because her current job is part-time and doesn’t pay very much, lenders have refused to extend her mortgage. She has to sell her house within the next few weeks, but will only have a very small amount of equity left to buy another. Her options are limited and depressing. She has no pension.
Over the years, I have made excuses for each of her financial missteps. She was a single parent, which no doubt put her under immense pressure and she could not have predicted or prepared for the recession. She also made some investments that went badly wrong – again, something she could not have predicted. But in recent years, as I have managed my own finances, I have examined the situation with a little more cynicism, largely because my spending habits are so similar to hers. And that terrifies me.
Mum took a career break in her 50s for health reasons, and I fully supported her finding a job that came with less stress. But while a sensible person would understand that a reduction in income means outgoings have to decrease too, I don’t think this occurred to Mum. I think she recognised it on some level – a level once removed – but couldn’t see how it would apply practically to her life.
To this day, she buys the most expensive dog food there is, and regularly splashes out on costly haircuts. Because she has always done these things; they are as commonplace and basic to her as having a shower in the morning.
The thing is, I want her to have those things. I know they make her feel human and normal. I appreciate the huge wrench it would be to give them up. And I can see how sacrificing them would be such an emotional price to pay, that she just … doesn’t.
Luckily, I am also able to grasp how unbelievably misguided her approach is. But, in all honesty, without my mum as a cautionary tale, I could see myself repeating the same patterns.
Here are just some of the ways my financial genes manifest themselves:
There are certain things I don’t automatically associate with costing money – heating, for, example. Keeping my home at a constant ambient temperature is something I am used to and expect. “Spoilt!”, I hear you cry, and you would be absolutely right.
Then there is the fact that I manage to justify spending in my head. I can turn any purchase from a frivolity into a necessity. New shoes – we all need shoes. An expensive present for a friend – I want to show them how special they are.
I once watched my mother buy three winter coats in one go. “I need different colours and styles for work,” she said, making it sound so sensible.
To me, money equals convenience. I rarely spend time looking for a better or cheaper deal – after all, money is affording me the luxury of saving time.
Like Mum, I don’t want to be reminded of my frivolity. I’m not in debt, but I am guilty of putting a “naughty” purchase on my credit card, so I get all the pleasure of the new item without the visual reminder of a depleted current account.
“I didn’t realise just how bad things were,” my mum told my aunt during their phone call. Which leads me to believe she has been hiding her debts from herself, too.
When I do manage to save, it feels nice to see the amount in my savings account increasing. But when I have to dip into it – for a car repair or unexpected bill – the upward struggle of saving suddenly seems pointless. So I’ll spend a little more, get the bug again and the numbers quickly start to snowball.
Last year, when Mum’s financial situation must already have been dire, she spent thousands of pounds on the house. Admittedly, it is nice, but had she shopped around, she could have achieved the effects for half the price. She didn’t tell me until after the work was complete, correctly predicting I would have been furious.
Later, she justified the spending by saying it would add value to the house. Incorrect, according to the local estate agent. In fact, it makes the house a less attractive proposition for developers.
Ultimately, she wanted to make the changes and was able to rationalise it.
It is easy to see how attitudes to money are passed down through generations. They are like any other attitude or habit. I don’t remember ever having a conversation about saving money when I was younger. In fact, the concept of showing a bit of self-control to reap financial reward in the future has only been hammered home to me in recent years by my husband. And, by God, it has taken a lot of hammering.
As well as nurture, nature has its part to play too. A recent scientific study revealed that our spending and saving habits do come from our parents. Twins who grew up separately showed identical patterns of spending and saving, and while social and environmental factors do influence how we treat money, this influence declines over time. Apparently by the age of 40, it is all down to genetics. Hopefully, I have enough time to break my spending habits and rewire my financial brain.
Seeing my mum so reduced, so diminished, not just financially but mentally, is heartbreaking. Worst of all, we don’t talk about it. There is so much shame and anger attached.
I am angry that Mum didn’t heed warnings or accept the help that has been offered – numerous times. And because I know that until she takes responsibility, no new pattern can emerge, maybe there is worse to come.
And Mum is angry because she has nothing to show for her efforts. The sum total of her life, of her living, is so small. She still can’t quite understand how she has got to the place she is in. Or why.
The instant gratification of her spending has always been fleeting; she probably doesn’t even know where all the money went. It just did, like some magic trick that leaves you scratching your head.
I often think, if I just won a few thousand pounds, that would fix everything. But that’s how I know that I still have a long way to go in my battle against my repeating my financial heritage. The reality is that a wedge of money might paper over some cracks, but, like a gas filling the space it is in, I would spend what I had and the same problems would crop up.
It will be a continued struggle to keep my attitude to money in the black, but I am determined to do it. After all, I have seen first hand that financial security is priceless.

Mr Kipling factory in Barnsley expects to crank out a record 180m mince pies in the run-up to this Christmas
This 2020 sq ft penthouse is a five-minute walk from the new Victoria Gate shopping centre, which includes the largest John Lewis outside London. No need to commute – it has an in-house office. But there are just two bedrooms and the only outside space is the twin parking lots. Asking price: £650,000. Rightmove 0113 451 3360
The world is full of stuff and things, so why add to the haul with unnecessary Christmas presents? We’re not saying don’t give a gift at all, but in a world of high consumption and hoarding why not give one that isn’t a thing.
Calla Wahlquist: For the past decade at least one member of my family has lived 4,000km away, so I get flight vouchers pretty regularly. It started when I moved to Bunbury, Western Australia, and couldn’t afford to fly back to Victoria to visit my parents on a $500-a-week cadet journalist salary. This year my sister and her partner bought me a voucher for flights to Port Hedland, because they are having a baby and I want to meet it.
Ensure your far-flung loved one has no excuse not to visit, or shuffle your favourite homebody off on an enforced adventure. Qantas, Virgin and Jetstar sell flight vouchers, as do booking companies such as Webjet.
Did your friend grow up loving horses despite being raised in an inner-city apartment? Does your cousin never stop talking about how he could have been a guitar god before his corporate career took over? Is your dad’s cooking so bad it’s a cliché?
It’s never too late for an old dog to learn new tricks (as long as that old dog isn’t hoping to become a career athlete). Cooking classes, in particular, seem increasingly popular, and many top chefs offer one-off sessions with small groups. Bonus – a delicious meal at the end, as long as you don’t burn it.
Elle Hunt: I was given tickets to Taylor Swift’s Sydney concert by my then boyfriend, the idea being he’d fly over from New Zealand to join me. Because they were in such high demand, it was nearly a year away, and we broke up in the interim. When the time came, I had to check that he did not still intend to come. Then I sold them both to a friend, at mate’s rates but nonetheless at a profit – and got better seats as review tickets for free. Nailed it, really.
3D movie showings, where you sit in a big armchair and someone brings a champagne or whatever, are ridiculously indulgent these days but totally guilt free if they’re a gift. Film festivals and open-air cinemas are also excellent presents for movie buffs. For a gift that keeps on giving, annual subscriptions to theatre and ballet companies ensure you are appreciated year round.
For those more into music, tickets to the hottest touring act go down a treat, but you have to buy at least two so they aren’t on their own. Some booking agencies also offer vouchers.
Zoos, museums, galleries, golf clubs, sporting teams, gyms – there are still dozens of social interaction activities that don’t involve the internet. Set someone up for a year of cultural or artistic enjoyment, or a solid season of shouting at a game in real life, surrounded by lots of other people shouting at the game.
One year my mother-in-law gave everyone Red Balloon vouchers for various experiences she thought we’d like, and because she’s pretty cluey we did actually like them all. (This isn’t a humorous mother-in-law anecdote – hi Jenny!).
Skydiving, hot-air ballooning, swimming with sharks – these are all things you are unlikely to do on a whim, but if someone sends you along it’s a different story.
Vouchers often expire, so don’t drop a bundle on a skydiving package for someone if they are going to wuss out or procrastinate about using it. And don’t toy with people too much – if someone has vertigo it’s not going to be funny to send them on the Sydney harbour bridge climb.
Sometimes the things people really want just can’t be bought. Personalised vouchers to babysit young siblings or nieces and nephews, clean your parents’ house or mow the lawn, are practical and appreciated. For your significant other, a voucher (booklet – let’s not be stingy) to massage your partner’s shoulders, or do something else to your partner’s something else, can really score brownie points as long as it doesn’t look like you just mocked them up that morning when you remembered what day it was.
Anonymous: A friend gave her brother a trailer full of poo one year, which went to a developing community to help them with agriculture/fertiliser. She literally gave him shit for Christmas, but he couldn’t complain as it was for a good cause. Passive aggressive and charitably effective.
There are plenty of charities and aid organisations which let you buy something for someone who really truly needs it, on behalf of your friend or relative who doesn’t.
Oxfam, for example, offers a range of altruistic donations-as-gifts, including valuable animals such as a goat or chicken, a water well, a bag of seed or, yes, a heap of manure. The Alternative Technology Association is a non-profit organisation which installs solar-powered lighting in East Timorese villages.
There’s a solid chance the recipient will be mildly disappointed by this gift, but it’s equally unlikely they’ll show it.
It goes without saying that a pet is not just for Christmas, so please don’t impulse-buy someone a dog. Instead, why not help out a shelter which will end up looking after all those animals when too many people forget the golden rule. Donate to keep struggling shelters running or help a friend become a foster parent. This is another gift of charity on behalf of someone else but many shelters, such as Greyhound Rescue NSW, have also gotten on to the merchandise game.
Further afield, a non-domesticated animal gift can be bestowed by sponsoring an orangutan. Several organisations facilitate this, including the Orangutan Project which lets you “adopt” one for as little as $12 a month. One-off purchases include a bag of feed, puzzles, medical care, or a year at jungle school for five orphans.
There’s no reason why you shouldn’t be directly involved in your loved one having all the fun. Put your creative talents to use – if you’re a writer why not pen a personalised story? Musicians, write someone a song. If your talents lie mainly in just having a really good time, stage an excellent day out for a friend. It could be anything from a trip to the zoo and a nice dinner somewhere or a completely bespoke adventure around your home town.
What is essentially buying a ball of gas which probably ceased to exist several millennia ago has become the ultimate in trite romantic gestures. But it doesn’t just have to be for Valentines Day.
There are a bunch of unofficial commercial companies that let you name a star in return for money, for the astronomy-mad sister or the rich uncle who already owns everything on the planet. Note, however, the only place that star name will be registered is on the company’s database.
I was interested to read about the Institution of Engineering and Technology (Report, 8 December) highlighting the problem of girls not being given toys that might lead to an interest in science and engineering. The report blames the marketing of toys. However, pressures exist elsewhere. As a male former scientist I have made attempts to encourage people to buy toys for girls that are gender neutral, educational and linked to practical exercises. In every case I have been thwarted by various female adults and told for example: “She is a ‘girly’ girl, she must have a pink toy, dress or something relating to cooking.” It seems to be the practice in many cultures that the pressure for girls to behave or dress in a certain way or to become a mother comes not from men but from older women. It is they who need to change.

Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary, has been dropped from a list of moderate Conservative MPs who are set for a private meeting with the prime minister next Wednesday, after she criticised Theresa May for wearing £995 trousers.
The group, whose members include advocates of a soft Brexit such as Alistair Burt, Nicholas Soames, Nick Herbert and Anna Soubry, had been invited in to No 10 to discuss the government’s strategy for handling the article 50 negotiations with the other 27 EU-member states.
Morgan was initially among them; but the invitation was withdrawn after she gave an interview in which she criticised May.
“Disinviting Nicky because of a comment on the prime minister’s trousers is frankly playground politics,” said one backbencher involved.
Morgan, who has become a trenchant critic of the government since being sacked by May, said the prime minister’s choice of the designer leather trousers, which she wore for a photoshoot with the Sunday Times, had been “noticed and discussed” in local Tory circles.
“I don’t have leather trousers. I don’t think I’ve ever spent that much on anything apart from my wedding dress,” Morgan said.
May’s irritation about Morgan’s remarks may have been exacerbated after she was questioned about the trousers by reporters on her flight to visit Bahrain earlier this week.
Asked if her wardrobe choices showed she was out of touch with ordinary voters, May responded: “I stood on the steps of Downing Street and said what I did about the importance of a country that works for everyone because that’s what I have heard from people as I’ve gone around the country, as I’ve met people in a whole variety of circumstances.
“I believe it is important for politicians to get out and about and that’s what I continue to do. It is important we have a country that works for everyone.”
Some of the MPs in the informal coalition of backbenchers were among potential rebels who threatened to back Labour’s motion calling on May to publish more detailed plans for her Brexit negotiating stance last Wednesday.
Some hope to use the meeting to express their irritation at the government’s last-minute decision to amend Labour’s motion, by committing the Commons to May’s self-imposed end of March deadline for invoking article 50, the formal process for leaving the EU.
MPs voted overwhelmingly for the amended motion, with only diehard Europhile Kenneth Clarke opposing it; but some Conservatives felt bounced into expressing support for Brexit without having seen the prime minister’s negotiating stance.
A No 10 spokesman said he would not comment on any specific meeting, adding: “The prime minister meets and engages with colleagues all the time.”
A seasonal take on the classic. You need to make the infusion three weeks ahead (so this could be ready for New Year’s Eve), but there’s little else to it. Serves one.
For the prune infusion
2-3 handfuls dried prunes
Equal measures gin and Campari
Half-fill a big sterilised jar with prunes, top with the booze, seal and store.
To serve, fill a whisky glass with ice, add the infusion and vermouth, and stir for a minute. Gently squeeze the orange over the top, then drop in and stir for a minute, to release the oils. Garnish with an infused prune.
Root vegetables are cheap and abundant in winter, but they’re often underrated and, as a result, underused. They are the less showy cousins of our summery veg stars, full of fibre and very versatile. This week, I’ve been cooking with parsnips, which are one of my favourite parts of Christmas lunch: caramelised, chewy, soft and sweet after a good roasting nestled in among the potatoes. But they’re good for everyday cooking, too: bake them in cream for a gratin, and serve them with something appley – their perfect match. Or grate them raw and use in a salad or in a gloriously moist sponge cake with an indecently good burnt butter icing.
The apple brings a hint of sweetness to this rich and velvety allioli, which melts all over the piping-hot, creamy gratin. Serves six.
750g parsnips, peeled
1 garlic clove, peeled and halved
15g butter
125ml double cream
125ml creme fraiche
200ml whole milk
6 sprigs thyme, leaves picked
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
75g ground almonds
1-2 tbsp extra-virgin olive (or rapeseed) oil, to drizzle
For the apple allioli
2 apples, peeled, cored and cut into chunks
2 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped
3 tbsp cider vinegar
200ml mild olive oil
