last-minute happy ending
a masterpiece four years in the making
a pleasant enough movie
skilled ensemble actors
a feel-good picture in the best sense of the term

interesting , but not compelling
simplistic , silly and tedious
everything is off
too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one .
some episodes work , some don't .
